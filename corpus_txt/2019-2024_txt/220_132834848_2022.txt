Abstract: This study aims to explain the strategy of the Yogyakarta Tourism Office in the economic recovery of the tourism sector during the Covid-19 period. So far, tourism has become the fourth largest sector that contributes to the country's foreign exchange after palm oil (CPO), oil and gas and mining (coal). The world of tourism has been hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Since the Covid-19 outbreak, all sectors have experienced a drastic decline, including the tourism sector, which has been in the second position as Indonesia's second largest foreign exchange contributor. This pandemic condition is forcing tourists to cancel their travel plans to Indonesia, one of which is the city of Yogyakarta. Based on statistics, Yogyakarta has the title of the tourism city most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. In just over a year, the tourism industry in the city of Yogyakarta suffered losses of up to Rp. 10 trillion. This is because Yogyakarta is the second most popular tourist destination in Indonesia after Bali. It is undeniable that Yogyakarta tourism has a great influence on the community's economy. The method used in this study is a qualitative method with a descriptive type of research. The findings of this study are the Yogyakarta’s Government Tourism Office (Dinpar) in its efforts to restore the tourism sector economy through the implementation of the Covid-19 protocol; new normal policy; implementation of CHSE (Cleanliness, Health, Safety, and Environment Sustainability); restoration of MICE (meetings, incentives, conventions, exhibitions); domestic tourism; and events gradually; revitalization of the agrarian sector through the development of agribusiness.        KEMUDI: JURNAL ILMU PEMERINTAHAN, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 1. 2022  34  INTRODUCTION Indonesia has the potential of beautiful natural resources and has great potential in tourism development. Tourism potential can be maximized to encourage the country's foreign exchange earnings. This potential is an attraction for tourists, especially foreign tourists, because of the diversity of cultures from various regions in Indonesia. The tourism potential will be developed by the Indonesian government in the hope of providing foreign exchange for the country. (www.indonesia-investments.com, 2016) During the leadership of President Joko Widodo, Indonesia's tourism sector became the fourth largest sector that contributed to the country's foreign exchange after palm oil (CPO), oil and gas and mining (coal). (www.kemenperin.go.id, 2016) Based on data from the Ministry of Tourism, the number of foreign tourist arrivals has continued to increase since 2015. Until August 2018, the number of foreign tourist arrivals reached 10.58 million from the target of 17 million foreign tourists. (BPS, 2017) The tourism sector has an important role in the development of the country. Its important role is increasing employment opportunities for the community such as: restaurants, tour guides, accommodation, services and others. In addition, the tourism sector also contributes directly in the form of construction and repair of roads, airports, cleaning programs, and so on. In the end, the benefits will be obtained by the community and tourists. But in reality, there are always things that cannot be predicted. The world of tourism is currently very affected by the Covid-19 virus.(www.bbc.com, 2020) The Covid-19 virus was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019. This virus then spread to almost all countries in the world, including Indonesia. On March 3, 2020, Indonesia announced its first case of Covid-19 in Jakarta. (indonesia.go.id, 2020) The number of cases continues to increase every day until the government makes a decision, implementing the PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restrictions) policy which is expected to inhibit the transmission of the virus. (Ministry of National Development Planning, 2021) Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) are 4,013,728 million cases of Covid-19 in 215 countries with a death toll of 278,993 people (www.who.int, 2020) It is undeniable how massive and deadly the impact caused by the spread of Covid-19 on mankind. Data from the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), shows that the number of foreign tourists to Indonesia throughout 2020 only reached 4.02 million visits. For comparison, in the same period the previous year, foreign tourists visited were 16.11 million or in other words, there was a decline of 75.03 percent (BPS, 2022). The data can be seen in Figure 1.   Picture 1. Data on Foreign Tourist Arrivals in 2020 vs 2019. Source: (BPS, 2022) Saputri  et al. Yogyakarta Tourism Office's Strategy …..  35  Figure 1 illustrates how significant the difference in the number of foreign tourists visits in 2019 and 2020. It can be seen that the number of tourist visits decreased in April 2020. This was due to the implementation of PSBB (Large-Scale Social Restrictions) regulated in PP No. 21 of 2020 concerning PSBB for Acceleration of Handling Corona Virus Disease 2019. This policy includes air travel restrictions, temporary closure of tourist attractions, restaurants, and lodging or hotels. This decline continues until 2021. In the first quarter, January to March 2021, foreign tourist visits were only recorded at 385,592 visits. This pandemic has caused the cancellation of travel plans to Indonesia, including trips to Yogyakarta (which also means cancellation of accommodation). In 2020, according to BPS, more than 409,000 workers in the tourism sector were laid off due to Covid-19 (www.kemenparekraf.go.id, 2020), which means that more than 95 percent of workers in the tourism sector were forcibly laid off without pay. Yogyakarta's tourism industry has lost an estimated 10 trillion rupiah due to Covid-19 for more than a year (Wahyuni, 2021). The tourism sector relies on social mobility which can affect tourist visits (Wahyuni, 2021). The tourism sector relies on social mobility which can affect tourist visits. During the PSBB period, hotel occupancy in Yogyakarta did not reach 10 percent. In fact, Yogyakarta is the second most popular tourist destination in Indonesia after Bali.  Investment in the tourism sector also decreased as hotels and other amenities in tourism destinations closed. The orientation of the market segment will shift from foreign tourists to domestic tourists, until international flights can return be in accordance the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. (www.kominfo.go.id, 2021) Based on this phenomenon, this study discusses specific integrated strategies in dealing with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the tourism sector and the creative economy of the Yogyakarta Tourism Office, especially during the emergency response period in 2020 and recovery in 2021 according to global conditions.  RESEARCH METHODS  This research method uses a qualitative method with a descriptive type. Collecting data using literature study techniques such as books, articles, and journals. After conducting a literature review, the researchers then conducted face-to-face interviews with the Yogyakarta Tourism Office in the tourism industry. Interviews were conducted to find out more clear and appropriate data information that occurred in the field. The focus of the questions asked to The Head of The Tourism Industry: 1) how was the condition of Yogyakarta tourism before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic and how much impact was felt on the Yogyakarta tourism sector; 2) The application of the new normal policy and the application of CHSE (Cleanliness, Health, Safety, and Environment Sustainability) as a condition for tourism businesses to be effective or not in dealing with Covid-19; 3) a program launched by the Yogyakarta Tourism Office in terms of economic recovery in the tourism sector; 4) what is the strategy of The Yogyakarta Tourism Office in restoring the tourism sector economy during the Covid-19 pandemic; 5) the challenges faced by The Tourism Office of Yogyakarta at this time and how to overcome these challenges. After the researchers conducted interviews with The Head of The Tourism Industry, then the interview data was processed using an interactive analysis model consisting of three stages: data collection, data presentation, and conclusion drawing.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The tourism sector is the main driver of Yogyakarta's economy. Around 55.37 percent of Yogyakarta's economy is the contribution of the tourism industry and all its supports. Covid-19 has caused significant losses because the number of foreign tourists coming to Yogyakarta has drastically decreased, including cultural and historical destinations. Several rules to prevent the spread of Covid-19, including emergency PPKM, level 4 PPKM and PSBB, have KEMUDI: JURNAL ILMU PEMERINTAHAN, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 1. 2022  36  prevented people from traveling freely. In fact, tourism depends on human mobility. (Secretary of Yogyakarta, 2021)  The Yogyakarta Tourism Office recorded losses of almost Rp. 81 billion in the early days of the pandemic. This figure was obtained from the income of the Yogyakarta Tourism Office from March 2020 to April 2020. Not including 15 types of tourism businesses, 776 informal and formal tourism services, along with tens of thousands of other tourism workers who were dismissed. (Yogyakarta Tourism Office, 2020)  During 2020, the number of tourists staying at hotels decreased significantly. From the number of hotels which is approximately 172 star-hotels and 1,951 non-star hotels, only 3.2 million tourists rent. A total of 64.37 percent decreased when compared to the previous year, which was around 9 million tourists. Domestic tourists also decreased significantly from 3.2 million people in 2019, in 2020 only reaching around 42,800 people. The data can be seen in Figure 2.   Figure 2. Hotel room occupancy data in Yogyakarta in 2020. Source: (BPS Yogyakarta, 2021)  Figure 2 shows the hotel room occupancy rate in Yogyakarta during 2020, decreasing significantly until it reached its lowest point in April 2020. This phenomenon occurred because the government declared Covid-19 a non-natural disaster of a national nature, which was then followed by various social restriction policies. As a result, tourists are forced to cancel their travel plans, including plans to stay in Yogyakarta. In January 2021, a number of tourist destinations were still unable to operate because cases of the spread of Covid-19 did not subside. The same thing happens in the hotel business with hotel room occupancy rates which are only below 10%. (Kemenparekraf, 2022) Although the number of foreign tourists traveling to Yogyakarta is not like before the COVID-19 pandemic, several indicators show a positive increase from domestic tourists starting to dominate star hotels in Yogyakarta. In February 2021, BPS recorded that star hotels reached 26.8%, an increase compared to January 2021, which was 24.91% (BPS Yogyakarta, 2021). Whereas in March 2021 it reached 40.42%, another increase of 13.55 points compared to February 2021. Then from April to August 2021, the occupancy rate of hotel rooms decreased in line with the policy of banning Lebaran homecoming along with the implementation of PPKM level 4.  The rules for prohibiting going home during the Eid period and PPKM level 4 are aimed at preventing the expansion of Covid-19. On the other hand, this has a negative impact on tourism business income. This will also affect the economic sector when the number of tourist visits decreases, the number of people who will stay in hotels will decrease, as well as the Saputri  et al. Yogyakarta Tourism Office's Strategy …..  37  culinary sector, the MSME sector, and the tourist spending sector will experience a decrease. Tourist spending, which previously could have reached approximately 2.5 million, fell to 1 million. After surviving approximately one year, 53 tourism service businesses consisting of 21 restaurants and 32 hotels in Yogyakarta were permanently closed. Meanwhile, 100 other businesses chose to close temporarily. The pandemic situation makes it difficult for tourism service businesses to survive. During the Eid holidays, the hotel room occupancy rate is only around 5 to 7 percent. From these data, Covid-19 has at least had an impact on economic factors, including: (1) temporary closure of hotels, tourism industries, restaurants and others; (2) workforce downsizing, unpaid furlough and layoffs; (3) difficulty in liquidity due to inability to pay for working capital and investment loans; (4) permanent business closure.(Suwena & Widyatmaja, 2017) The progress of tourism in Yogyakarta began to be seen since 2006. The trend of domestic tourists coming to Yogyakarta in the period 2006-2014 experienced an average increase of 20.29 percent every year, with a range between 10-40 percent. As for foreign tourists, the increase during 2006-2014 was an average of 15.27 percent with an annual increase of around 9-27 percent. The increase in the number of tourists was also driven by an increase in tourist destinations and Regional Revenue (PHD). During 2006-2014 with an average of 43.99 percent, with an annual increase of 10-43 percent. (Wicaksono, 2020) This figure shows that Yogyakarta tourism is growing from year to year. A very good opportunity for the tourism industry such as hotels, inns, restaurants, souvenir centers, transportation within the city such as buses, motorcycle taxis, rickshaws and others. This also means that the tourism sector opens up considerable employment opportunities. This sector also contributes significantly to Regional Revenue (PHD). In 2018 the contribution of the tourism sector reached approximately 40 percent, making it the leading sector that year. However, in 2020, Yogyakarta's tourism sector is facing the Covid-19 pandemic. The government was forced to limit social activities through physical distancing policies and a ban on tourist visits in an effort to reduce the number of spreads of the virus. (Minister of Health of Indonesia, 2020)    Figure 3. DIY economic growth data. Source: (BPS Yogyakarta, 2021)  Figure 3 is a comparison of the economy in DIY before and during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Covid-19 pandemic caused the economic contraction of the 2020 Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) to reach minus -2.69 percent after the Yogyakarta City economy grew very well in 2019 due to the YIA development project the 2019 Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) reached 6.60 percent. Throughout 2020, the performance of the industrial sector as the main sector experienced a contraction, as did the tourism supporting sectors which were directly affected by restrictions on mobility during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data can be seen in Figure 4.KEMUDI: JURNAL ILMU PEMERINTAHAN, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 1. 2022  38    Figure 4. Data on the development of poverty and unemployment rates in DIY Source: (BPS Yogyakarta, 2021)   It is not only the tourism sector that is affected but also the Covid-19 pandemic has a direct impact on increasing poverty and the open unemployment rate in Yogyakarta, this has resulted in limited mobility and economic activity which has led to the dismissal of work in several sectors. In early March 2020, the poverty rate in DIY for the first time increased since March 2016 due to the pandemic impacting the Open Unemployment Rate (TPT) in August 2020. However, the open unemployment rate (TPT) in DIY in February 2021 began showed improvement, which was down from 4.57 percent to 4.28 percent. The impact of Covid-19 has broadly affected the economy and tourism of Yogyakarta, in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic the tourism sector was temporarily closed and all industrial sectors were also closed starting March 2020. Due to the closure of Yogyakarta tourism, tourism was almost paralyzed, suffered losses. which was quite large, and experienced a decline in income of approximately 40 percent, a decrease from the previous year (2019) which reached approximately 10 million tourists. All tourism industries and supporting sectors have also been affected by Covid-19, seen from the impact of the pandemic both in terms of life safety and the economy. The Government of the Special Region of Yogyakarta is gradually encouraging the tourism sector to increase again.  Based on this description and its detrimental impact for both Yogyakarta and the State of Indonesia. So it is important to see how Yogyakarta, in making policies to overcome this problem. The Tourism Office, especially located in Yogyakarta, with its role as the organizer of local government affairs, in accordance with its duties and functions has an important role. Especially in the development of tourism in the city of Yogyakarta. As stated in the vision of the Yogyakarta Tourism Office, namely "The realization of Yogyakarta as a leading tourist destination that relies on the strengths and advantages of local tourism and is able to strengthen identity, provide positive benefits for the community, and can become a locomotive for the development of Yogyakarta as a whole". The Tourism Office is trying to realize Yogyakarta as a tourist city that relies on the strengths and advantages of local tourism by optimizing the potential of tourism objects and attractions in Yogyakarta. In addition, the Tourism Office also has a role as a facilitator who collaborates with private entrepreneurs who also collaborate in the tourism sector such as hotel, restaurant or restaurant owners, and travel agents or travel agencies. The Tourism Office is also trying various program activities to build tourism. One of them is the event for the title of creativity of tourism actors, with the aim of providing opportunities for tourism actors to further develop their creativity. This activity accommodates the creativity of Yogyakarta  39  tourism actors in the form of tourism promotions, tourism performances and routine activities in commemorating important days - both national and important days of Yogyakarta to stage activities that are routinely held. The Yogyakarta Tourism Office now has several fields including Tourist Attractions, Tourism Resource Development, Marketing, and the Tourism Industry Sector. Each of them has their respective duties and functions, but in this discussion only focuses on the Tourism Industry Sector which has a significant role in the economic recovery of the tourism sector during the Covid-19 pandemic because this industrial sector has the task of carrying out guidance and supervision of the tourism industry to increase the number of certified tourism service businesses. Not only that, the industry sector also creates interesting events for tourists and implements strict health protocols for both the public and business actors as well as supervising business actors to improve health protocols, so that tourists can safely and comfortable doing tourism activities. One example is that all hotels in Yogyakarata must have a Cleanliness, Health, Safety & Environment Sustainability (CHSE) certificate, require their guests to bring a health certificate, a swab test result letter, PCR or vaccine certificate, and all hotels implement health protocols. more strictly. Several factors that support the role of the Yogyakarta tourism Office include; (1) budget availability, this is a fundamental element in the implementation of a program. The budget is a supporting factor for all government programs in carrying out their duties and functions as a public servant. It is undeniable that the size of a program's budget will affect the effectiveness of the program. On the other hand, the budget can turn into a constraint if the amount needed is not appropriate. Seeing the current condition of Yogyakarta tourism, there needs to be an overall change because it has to adjust to pandemic conditions with strict health protocols. (2) The availability of facilities and infrastructure enables the government to carry out the program agenda more easily. The facilities and infrastructure of The Tourism Office consist of physical infrastructure at the office and infrastructure to support tourism activities in Yogyakarta. (3) The partnership forged by The Tourism Office in developing tourism includes the hotel and restaurant entrepreneur organization PHRI (Indonesian Hotel and Restaurant Association) specifically for star hotels, GPY (Jogjakarta Hospitality Association) specifically for non-star hotels, APJI (Association of Indonesian Catering Entrepreneur). Partnerships with the private sector are usually in the form of sponsorship, promotion, organizing momentum and incidental events, as well as monitoring and coaching for Yogyakarta tourism actors. During the pandemic the Tourism Office implements strategies and mitigation. There are three stages: emergency response, recovery, and normalization. Emergency response prioritizes human safety, especially in February to June 2020. The government issues a new policy or rule, large-scale social restrictions to reduce the number of Covid-19 cases which is increasing day by day. This policy limits activities outside the home such as: school, work, religious places, use of public transportation, or activities in other public places. The Yogyakarta local government postponed various activities by focusing the budget on mitigation programs. The mitigation program appoints an internal study team to identify impacts on tourism and the creative economy. The approach at this emergency response stage is a matching fund, which is a form of collaboration between industry and universities through the provision of a matching fund incentive scheme by the Ministry of Education and Culture. (pariwisata.jogjakota.go.id, 2022)  The Yogyakarta Government spends 2.48% of the APBD (Regional Revenue and Expenditure Budget), while the Operational and Unexpected Expenditure Budget is approximately Rp. 149.55 billion of which the funds can be used for handling Covid-19 with the following priorities, the first priority in the field of health care, namely the provision of health services for UKP Referrals, SMEs and Referral SMEs at the Provincial Level; Provision of Service Facilities, Facilities, Infrastructure and Medical Devices for Referral UKP, UKM and Referral UKM at Provincial Level; Operation of the Integrated Command Post for Handling KEMUDI: JURNAL ILMU PEMERINTAHAN, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 1. 2022  40  Covid-19; and Health Support for the Implementation of Health Protocols. (Yogyakarta Mayor Regulation Number 22 of 2022 Yogyakarta Regional Development Plan 2023-2026, 2022). The second priority is the economic impact, namely, the empowerment and protection of cooperatives; empowering MSMEs, developing small businesses; development of local wisdom and cultural potential; domestic and foreign marketing, attractions, destinations, and provincial tourism strategic areas, and others. Then the Yogyakarta government issued policies and strategies for economic recovery such as the implementation of the Covid-19 protocol, the restoration of MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conventions, Exhibitions), domestic tourism and events gradually, revitalizing the agrarian sector through agribusiness development, and others. Yogyakarta local government programs and activities in an effort to handle the tourism sector, namely, promoting tourism through internet media such as blogs, books, brochures, Instagram, Youtube, Tiktok, and others; providing assistance to new normal standard operating procedures (SOP), procuring hygiene equipment and providing simulation and evaluation assistance for new normal SOPs. This health protocol SOP is written in the DIY Governor Regulation No. 77 of 2020 concerning the Implementation of Discipline and Law Enforcement of Health Protocols as Efforts to Prevent and Control Corona Virus Disease 2019. There are several programs held by the Yogyakarta Tourism Office which continue to run such as annual and monthly events using different methods, namely the hybrid method (can be done face-to-face and online), the direct method by streaming, the taping method (recording video but not directly). broadcast, but a series of edits are made first so that the show is more interesting, according to existing rules and minimal errors) and broadcast to Youtube. film-making programs such as 360 films, tourist village films, training of tourism actors through online training for needs during the pandemic and post-pandemic in the hope that these tourism actors will continue to run according to existing rules related to the pandemic period. The latest program is a tourist village object which continues to be developed and is always encouraged in terms of promotion, the addition of new attractions such as a new city turn which includes shopping city tours, architect tours, and special interest tours. The Yogyakarta Tourism Office also has a superior strategy through big events such as the Jogja Night Carnaval which became 10 nationally broadcast via Live Streaming and was attended by Minister Sandiaga Uno and the Mayor. Then The Tourism Office carried out a taping method involving local flower market artists who had the potential to include music players, dancers, and MSMEs, the prawirotaman festival program and a program to strengthen 18 tourist villages so that they still existed and were ready to be visited by tourists. The Yogyakarta Government also took several policy responses from the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy No. 4 of 2021 concerning Business Activity Standards in the Implementation of Risk-Based Business Licensing in the Tourism Sector to improve and restore the tourism sector economy: 1. The opening of a productive and safe sector, by gradually implementing the Cleanliness, Health, Safety & Environment Sustainability (CHSE) protocol is an important requirement and requirement for tourism businesses to ensure the health, security and safety of the community in their tourism activities. Then apply online reservations for purchasing tickets, hotels, food and others. This is implemented in order to reduce direct contact with banknotes from hand to hand which may be exposed to the Covid-19 virus. 2. Acceleration of fiscal stimulus (budget realization), until in the first Quarter (January-March) 2021 the realization of the DIY APBD has reached 9.98 percent, down from 11.95 percent in 2020, for that the Yogyakarta Government must accelerate economic recovery due to the pandemic Covid-19 and increase productivity, innovation and economic competitiveness. 3. Digitizing the economy and finance, especially MSMEs, by using Qris to every merchant (store) at the end of March 2021 there were as many as 181,395  41  merchants (stores) using QRIS as digital payments and an increase of 20.99 percent compared to December 2020. Yogyakarta's tourism conditions are now starting to stabilize and show a slight improvement from before, which fell drastically, enforced strict health protocols and disciplined health and people who were required to vaccinate. However, the latest policy related to the Implementation of Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM) throughout Java-Bali requires Yogyakarta city tourism to temporarily close considering the increasing number of victims and the emergence of the latest variant, namely the Delta variant. In the future, economic recovery is highly dependent on gamechanger factors in the form of vaccination of the widest community and coupled with the implementation of health protocols and collaboration in policy responses between the central government, local governments, and related institutions.   The implementation of the new normal policy held by the Indonesian government which was then implemented in various regions including Yogyakarta refers to epidemiological calculations such as the number or reproduction rate of the virus (R0) is less than 1, then the new normal policy can be implemented. Another consideration is measuring the rate of disease progression, virus control and health care capacity. The data is shown in Figures 5 to 8.  Figure 5. Covid-19 zoning map period II July 2020. Source: (bpbd.jogjaprov.go.id, 2021) KEMUDI: JURNAL ILMU PEMERINTAHAN, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 1. 2022  42   Figure 6. Covid-19 zoning map period II July 2020 Source: (bpbd.jogjaprov.go.id, 2021)   Figure 7. Covid-19 zoning map period I Januari 2021 Source: (bpbd.jogjaprov.go.id, 2021)        43  Figure 8. Covid-19 zoning map period I September 2021. Source: (bpbd.jogjaprov.go.id, 2021)  Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 show that at the regional level, local governments are allowed to implement new normal policies if the area is at a moderate level. Some of the pictures above show that Yogyakarta can implement a new normal policy where the condition of Yogyakarta is at a moderate risk level. As we know that several regions in Java, including Yogyakarta, apply five categories of assessment in seeing the severity of the pandemic, ranging from crisis level, severe, substantial, moderate and low. These limitations are expected to be the basis, so that the determination of the new normal policy is really carried out carefully and with full consideration. The new normal was adopted by the Indonesian government to save the national economic condition, as well as reduce the risk of employee layoffs by the tourism industry. The government targets Indonesia's economic growth to remain positive in the second and third quarters of 2020 at the threshold of 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent. The implementation of the new normal is expected to support economic growth, with the operation of the industrial sector, the economy will recover and increase economic growth. The implementation of CHSE (Cleanliness, Health, Safety, and Environment Sustainability) is the embodiment of health regulations which later from the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy mentioned CHSE, during a pandemic the most important thing is the health protocol that has existed since the beginning of the pandemic, how to comply with everything including the level of the link that has been set. there are PSBB, PPKM, up to PPKM level 4. CHSE is a protocol for cleanliness, health, safety and environmental sustainability to rebuild trust, sense of security and comfort in traveling during the pandemic. This protocol is more directed at businesses in the tourism sector such as restaurants and hotels. The Yogyakarta government has socialized and implemented CHSE for every tourist regarding consumer rights and guarantees, as well as procedures if they suffer from symptoms of Covid-19 virus infection. So that this can be maximized, The Health Office also cooperates with tourism actors and is facilitated by The Tourism Office to actively conduct socialization so that everyone understands the application of health and safety protocols. The local government also supports by providing facilities and infrastructure at various tourist destinations, such as facilities for washing hands. Tourism promotion is also carried out through videos or similar means. The promotion is carried out to show Yogyakarta's KEMUDI: JURNAL ILMU PEMERINTAHAN, VOLUME 7, ISSUE 1. 2022  44  readiness to accept tourist arrivals for vacation in order to remain safe and comfortable. The Covid-19 pandemic is forcing people to live clean and healthy behaviors. New normal era tourism prioritizes quality tourism, because tourists tend to be interested in tourist destinations that are considered quality. According to Bobby Ardyanto Setyo Aji (Chairman of the Indonesian Tourism Industry Association (GIPI) DIY), the criteria for quality tourism include having CHSE standards. Refreshing products is also needed with a note taking into account the wishes of tourists in the new normal era. This challenge requires tourism managers to take a deeper look at the needs and desires of tourists without ignoring the importance of implementing health protocols. The policy direction of the Yogyakarta Tourism Office follows the decision of the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy, which will be adjusted by the Yogyakarta Tourism Office so that it can be implemented easily. Legally it is listed in PP5 2021 related to serial risk-based business licensing starting from 2018 NIB 1.0, 2019-2020 NIB 1.1 and 2022 NIB RBA (latest version). For hotels, restaurants, travel bureau businesses and others, the risk levels are low, medium low, medium high, high risk. Currently, hotels cannot determine their own categories but must scale from low to high, and tourism businesses that have a medium to high to high risk scale are required or required to standardize. Meanwhile, the standardization related to the current regulations has not yet been issued, the only ones that have just come out now are SNI (for standardizing hotels and still using the old candy) and the CHSE. Then for medium to low risk to low risk, they are not required to standardize and are voluntary. This is one of the tourism service programs to provide assistance and supervision (without punishment) and will be assisted in migrating from the old NIB to the RBA NIB (latest version). CONCLUSION Based on the explanations that have been described by the author, the data provided and the authors obtain, the authors can understand and explain the Strategy of the Tourism Office for the Economic Recovery of the Yogyakarta Tourism Sector during the Covid-19 pandemic. From this research, it can be seen that The Yogyakarta Tourism Office has a very large role, especially in tourism development. Yogyakarta as a tourist city that relies on the strength and excellence of local tourism by optimizing the potential and tourist attraction of Yogyakarta. In the tourism industry, Yogyakarta has a significant role in the economic recovery of the tourism sector during the Covid-19 pandemic because this industrial sector has the task of carrying out guidance and supervision of the tourism industry to increase the number of certified tourism service businesses. Yogyakarta has tourism potential to improve the regional economy. There are many interesting destinations in Yogyakarta such as Tugu Jogja, Malioboro, Taman Sari, Gembira Loka Zoo, Kilometer Zero Point, South Square and others. However, the emergence of the Covid-19 virus has paralyzed Yogyakarta tourism and throughout 2020 the performance of the industrial sector as the main sector experienced a contraction, as well as tourism supporting sectors that were directly affected by restrictions on mobility during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Yogyakarta government also makes policies and strategies for economic recovery, such as the implementation of the Covid-19 protocol, recovery of MICE, domestic tourism, and events gradually, revitalizing the agrarian sector through agribusiness development. Then apply online reservations for ticket purchases, hotels, meals. From the implementation of the new normal policy, the application of CHSE and various programs that have been carried out with various new methods, it can be concluded that there is an increase in the economic recovery of the tourism sector. Currently Yogyakarta's tourism economy has experienced an increase since the Eid holiday in 2022 and all sectors have been opened after almost 2 years of being closed, there are no special requirements for travel both by air and by land. So that it can spur people to travel or return to their hometowns, then the agenda for events in Yogyakarta has returned to full starting from March to December this year. There are 4 points (promotion, infrastructure, institutional,  45  legality) steps that will be taken by The Tourism Office for now and in the future, namely to continue to increase tourism promotion, new tourist attractions such as tourist villages, bicycle lanes, improve infrastructure, increase legally tourism business as an element of tourism business development and assisting tourism business so that it is in accordance with existing regulations. The author's suggestion to the Yogyakarta Tourism Office is to issue a policy of limiting the quota of visits to all tourist attractions in Yogyakarta. An illustration example is Taman Sari tourism is limited to a visitor quota of 200 people per day, which may have been without a visitor limit, now we have to adapt and apply new governance so that this is useful to prevent the spread of Covid-19 which until now has not ended, and uphold high implementation of health protocols.
