DienderMay 22, 2022AbstractCurrently, the enormous amounts of waste being generated daily pose a worldwide problem.The environment is polluted with microplastics and recovery is hard and costly. Additionally,common petroleum-based plastics have very low production costs, making them very attractive.As an alternative, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) can be used, which have similar properties.However, these PHAs are grown intracellular by bacteria under specific conditions, which resultsin a complex and expensive pathway for extraction and downstream processing. The use of amembrane assisted spinning disk reactor (MA-SDR) to obtain cellular disruption might be thesolution to obtain an inexpensive and simple downstream process.In this work, the possible intensification of the PHA recovery process is explored. A study isperformed on the growth of PHA-containing bacteria on lab scale, making use of a sequencingbatch reactor with fixed conditions that might enhance PHA formation. Futhermore, an MA-SDR parametric study is performed using synthetic PHB to obtain an idea on the permeationand degradation behavior in the spinning disk. Lastly, the MA-SDR and a conventional acetoneextraction process are simulated using Aspen Plus. A techno-economic assessment is performedto analyze the feasibility of this novel process.It is found that under constant conditions, a bacteria strain of 0.25 g/L can be created, where25% of bacterial weight could be attributed to PHA formation. It is discovered that alternationis key in performing accumulation cycles, allowing regrowth of the bacteria population after anitrogen limitation. From the parametric study it is concluded that a bacteria strain does notlead to accumulation problems due to its smaller size, high permeation rates can be reachedand processing in the MA-SDR resulted in a widened operating window for synthetic PHB.Nevertheless, further experiments will have to be performed in order to optimize the biomassconcentration and conditions optimal for bacteria disruption.Additionally, the novel MA-SDR is found to be promising in terms of economics, resulting ina production cost of 2.29 $/kg, which is low compared to the conventional process (3.50 $/kg).Especially electricity demand and the capital investment of the MA-SDRs are shown to havethe largest influence, at 92.6 and 44.5% of the operational and capital costs, respectively. Witha sensitivity analysis it is found that both production capacity and biomass concentration havea high influence on the PHB price per kg and capital investment and can lead to vast decreasesof the production price when chosen properly.Based on all gathered knowledge, it can be stated that possibilities lie in the use of the MA-SDRfor extraction and downstream processing of intracellular PHAs, but that further research iscrucial for an accurate model and results.iList of Figures1.1 Life-cycle of microplastics [9] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11.2 Repeating unit of the PHB polymer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21.3 Schematic visualization of a bioreactor under growth and accumulation conditions 21.4 TEM image of Cupriavidus necator cells with accumulated PHB [20] . . . . . . 31.5 Overview of the conventional PHA production process steps.

that are generated nowadays pose a worldwide problem [1, 2].The highly dominating consumerism leads to excessive use of petroleum-based plastics such aspolyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP), which are mainly used in (food) packaging, equip-ment manufacture and household appliances [3]. The polymers are flexible thermoplastics witha low melting point and good chemical resistance. These properties allow easy handling andcheap processing in successive steps towards the final application of these materials [4]. In fact,production costs are usually less than 1 e/kg of plastic, a very appealing cost for all mass pro-ducers [5, 6]. However, due to its chemical resistance and durability, these polymers cannot beeasily degraded in the environment, and its recycling is challenging. Small impurities can havea negative impact on the final properties of the recycled polymer, reducing its applicability [1].Therefore, most plastics are discarded and end up in the environment [4]. Around 50% of thelost resources end up in wastewater streams without being recycled. In total 70-80% of theenvironmental pollution is due to the non-biodegradable plastics and it is estimated that around10 million tons of plastic enter the oceans each year [2, 7]. There, the plastics break down tosmaller microparticles, spread out and stay in the environment for hundreds of years, posingrisks to both marine and human life, as is visualized in Figure 1.1 [8].Figure 1.1: Life-cycle of microplastics [9]1In this figure, it is clearly shown that after plastic has entered the environment, it circulatesthrough the ecosystem for a very long time, polluting not only oceans, but also land mass throughrainfall. The recovery of plastics from the oceans is not only hard, but also very expensive aslarge volumes of water have to be processed, making it an unattractive option [7]. This pollutionproblem presses for either a better recycling and waste management system, or for the develop-ment of a biodegradable replacement of the petroleum-based plastics. Well-studied biopolymersare polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and polylactic acids (PLAs), both biodegradable and able toreplace the widely used PP and PE [10, 11]. This research focuses on polyhydroxyalkanoates.1.1 PolyhydroxyalkanoatesFigure 1.2: Repeating unit of the PHBpolymerThe family of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are cur-rently stated as the most probable replacement of PEand PP [10, 12]. PHAs have properties with high re-semblance to PP, but, unlike PP, these polymers arebiodegradable and biocompatible [4, 13]. The PHAshave shown to be degradable by many organisms insoil, water or even the human body [1, 10, 14]. Usu-ally a distinction is made between short chain lengthPHAs (scl-PHA, 3-5 carbons) and medium chain lengthPHAs (mcl-PHA, 6-14 carbons). scl-PHAs are morerigid, more crystalline and display more common fea-tures to PP, which is why the focus of the rest of thisresearch will be on the scl-PHAs [10]. One of these scl-PHAs is polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).PHB is a promising polymer to replace PP in many applications, such as packaging, but also inmedical products, pharmaceuticals, tissue engineering or drug delivery, due to its biocompati-bility [1, 3, 12]. A repeating unit of the PHB polymer is shown in Figure 1.2.There are many bacteria that are able to produce PHAs, but most commonly used are Cupri-avidus necator (previously known as Alcaligenes eutrophus) and Plasticicumulans acidivorans,which are Gram-negative bacteria, able to produce PHB from various feedstocks, such as sugarcane, paper mill effluents or any other organic waste containing VFAs (volatile fatty acids),under aerobic conditions [7, 13, 15, 16]. Often, single cultures are used, requiring sterile condi-tions. However, the attention is shifting to using mixed microbial cultures as cheaper (waste)feedstocks can be used and waste management is simplified [7].Figure 1.3: Schematic visualization of a bioreactor under growth and accumulation conditions2The biosynthesis of intracellular PHA usually consists of two steps, where one is rich in nutrientsand the other is a limited and ’stressful’ environment for the bacteria, schematically depictedin Figure 1.3 [17]. Under balanced nutrient conditions, the synthesis of PHAs is blocked andacetyl-CoA is used for energy or cell growth. Under the limited conditions, either nitrogen orphosphorus is chosen as the limiting agent, while the carbon source is still in excess. In that case,the acetyl-CoA is directed to the PHA-pathway [13, 17]. The polymer is accumulated intracel-lularly and stored as an energy and carbon reserve [14]. Accumulated PHA also substantiallyimproves the resistance of the bacteria against osmotic shocks, higher temperatures and physicaldamage, providing it with properties crucial for survival in a fluctuating environment such aswastewater [18, 19].Figure 1.4: TEM image of Cupriavidusnecator cells with accumulated PHB [20]The accumulated PHA granules are typicallyaround 0.2-0.6 µm in size and can reach up until90% of the cell weight under the right conditions [1,19, 21]. This can be seen in the TEM image in Fig-ure 1.4 [20]. The granule core is more amorphousthan the outer rings and a 2-4 nm layer surroundsthe granule, which consists of lipids and proteins [1,3]. The molecular weight of these polymers rangesfrom 10,000 to 3,000,000 g/mol, with a polydisper-sity around 2.0 [22]. Typical melting temperaturesare between 174-180 ◦C and crystallinities around55-80% [22]. Degradation temperatures of biologi-cal PHB are between 227-256 ◦C [13].1.2 PHA production process, recovery and purificationThe complete production process of polyhydroxyalkanoates is quite complex. A schematicoverview of the steps is shown in Figure 1.5 [10]. Generally, the process consists of the fol-lowing main steps: 1) fermentation, 2) recovery of PHAs from the bacterial cell and 3) theseparation and purification of the polymer. A pretreatment step can be added directly afterseparation from the strain to destabilize the outer membrane and enhance the recovery. Totalproduction costs of PHAs, including fermentation and downstream processing, are usually inthe range of 2-5 e/kg [5].1.2.1 FermentationAs mentioned before, the fermentation process usually occurs in two steps: a growth and anaccumulation step. The first step, designed to increase biomass content of the strain, is usuallyperformed in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) under a feast-famine cycle [7, 23]. A feast-faminecycle first provides high concentrations of feed, after which a long starvation period occurs. Thistrains the bacteria strain to produce PHA, which they can consume once the carbon source iscompletely depleted [24, 25]. The second step, where accumulation under limitation of nitrogenor phosphorous occur, is achieved in a fed-batch reactor [25, 26, 27]. SBR operation is usuallydone in cycles of 4 steps: 1) An influent phase where new medium is added, 2) an aeration phasewhere oxygen is provided to a sufficient extent under stirred conditions, 3) a settling phase and 4)a withdrawal phase, where the effluent is discharged. A part of the effluent is generally suppliedto the successive fed-batch reactor, where suitable conditions for accumulation are created by3adding fresh medium [28].Figure 1.5: Overview of the conventional PHA production process steps. Adapted from Pérez-Rivero et al. [10]In literature, this fermentation process has been investigated in various combinations and undervarious conditions. In the growth or enrichment step, Johnson et al. used a 2 L bioreactor with12 h cycles at 30 ◦C, a pH of 7 and a main carbon source of sodium acetate [25]. pH controlwas performed with acetic acid and NaOH, ensuring no carbon limitation could occur. Underthe feast-famine cycle, they were able to double biomass content and obtain 0.625 g biomass/Levery 12 hours. They even showed immediate PHB production up to a concentration of about50 wt.%, but at these conditions the polymer was consumed within 6 hours. Under similarconditions, Marang et al. obtained 0.75 g biomass/L [29]. In the subsequent accumulation step,performed in fed-batch under nitrogen limitation, both achieved a PHB content of 80-85 wt.%for over 12 hours.Additionally, Mulders et al. tried simultaneous enrichment and accumulation in a single fed-batch reactor on lab-scale [24]. They showed that design of the substrate was possible, based ondesired PHB wt.% and biomass concentration. Under carefully calculated conditions and feed-on-demand, they were able to obtain the target of 80 wt.% for at least 20 hours in a strain of 2g biomass/L. It was found that high carbon to nutrient ratios were optimal for PHB formation,showing no differences in performance between nitrogen and phosphor limitation.Careful tuning of the conditions in both steps is crucial to obtain the highest biomass concentra-tion and PHA content. Costs are often immensely increased through use of expensive substratesand the required special (sterile) conditions [2]. Minor variations can have considerable effectson the final quality and quantity of the strain, which complicates successive recovery steps [6].However, the use of an SBR simplifies accounting for variations in feed and allows to compensatefor major nutrient and carbon source fluctuations, as is the case in waste feedstocks [23].This has already been applied on a pilot-scale successfully. Mulders et al. achieved 70-80 wt.%PHB accumulation on a 180 L pilot-scale within a few hours using organic waste as carbonsource [30]. Tamis et al. used a waste stream from a paper mill, obtaining 40 wt% PHB [31].This shows that there lies possibility in using waste streams as a carbon source.41.2.2 Recovery and separationAfter the fermentation, usually a separation step is applied, where bacteria are separated fromthe strain using common equipment such as centrifuges, sedimentors or filters [7, 10]. A pretreat-ment can be applied to weaken the cell membrane and enable easier penetration of chemicals[32]. This can be a wash with mild polar solvents to remove bacterial lipids, application of freez-ing/thawing cycles where cells are disrupted due to crystal formation or using high pressures andhigh temperatures [14, 21, 33]. Deshmukh et al. showed that a pretreatment with ultrasoundcan enhance recovery with almost a factor 2 [17]. Most procedures start with a drying stepto increase effectiveness of recovery [21]. After pretreatment or drying, the conventional PHArecovery process follows either a solvent extraction path or a cellular lysis path [6]. Both will bediscussed in the following sections.Solvent extractionThe solvent extraction path is the oldest and most applied method and consists of extractingPHAs directly from the bacteria using an appropriate solvent [14]. The solvent increases thepermeability of the cell membrane, allows PHAs to permeate through and finally dissolves thePHAs [7]. The efficiency of the solvent is highly increased when the biomass is dried beforehand[21, 33]. After the extraction, the undissolved cell fragments can easily be removed by filtrationor centrifugation, which results in a clear solution of solvent and PHA. To obtain the separatedpolymer, a precipitation step is necessary. An anti-solvent such as water or ethanol is added toprecipitate the PHA and obtain the product after filtration and drying [10, 21].A major disadvantage is that the solvents used are mostly chlorinated solvents such as sodiumhypochlorite (NaClO) and chloroform (CHCl3), which are highly toxic to both human and theenvironment [6, 10, 13]. Additionally, these harsh chemicals will alter the natural morphologyof the polymer [34, 35]. Despite this, high purities and recoveries can be obtained with solventextraction. López-Abelairas et al. compared different solvents, among which sodium hypochlo-rite and a combination with dichloromethane, and obtained purities up to 99% and recoveriesup to 90% [36]. Recovery costs corresponding to these processes are reported to be 5.23 and6.61 e/kg.Alternative solvents for the solvent extraction path are being explored constantly. Both Pavanet al. and Fiorese et al. investigated the use of propylene carbonate, a cyclic carbonate with alower toxicity and easier recovery [22, 33]. Fiorese et al. found that propylene carbonate can beused to extract PHA, but careful optimization is key as higher temperatures and specific contacttimes are required to obtain purities higher than 80% [22]. Pavan et al. observed very highsolvent recoveries and a recovery cost of 2.28 $/kg, where equipment size and materials usedwere found to be the aspects in need of optimization to develop a feasible process [33]. Anothersolvent investigated increasingly is acetone. The PHB solubility in acetone is not as high as inchlorinated compounds, but at elevated temperatures (around 100 ◦C) still a recovery of 91%can be obtained [37, 38, 39].High costs are inherently related to this solvent extraction process, because the PHA solutionshave a high viscosity, even at concentrations below 5 wt.% [21]. To obtain a workable mixture,very dilute solutions and thus high amounts of solvents are required [21, 40]. This results inhigh investment costs, but also in an energy intensive solvent recovery process [2, 6].5Chemical lysisIn chemical lysis, acids or bases are used to dissolve the cell matter instead of the PHA. Theuse of chlorinated compounds is thus minimized. Furthermore, this method allows for easyseparation of PHB from the liquid by filtration or centrifugation, which decreases the numberof subsequent downstream processing steps [4].Various studies investigated the use of acids, bases and surfactants to kill the cells and reportedcomparisons with chlorinated compounds. López-Abelairas et al. compared the costs and envi-ronmental impact of NaOH and H2SO4 [36]. They concluded that both alkali and acid performedquite good, reaching purities of 92% and 97% respectively and yields around 80%. EspeciallyH2SO4 was found to be a good candidate, with purities similar to an extraction method withNaClO. The downstream processing cost of this method was reported to be only 1.11 e/kg [36].Choi and Lee also extensively investigated several types of surfactants [41]. They found thatSDS performed well in terms of PHB purity and recovery (97.8 and 87.4% respectively), butthey concluded that the use of surfactants results in high recycle costs and is therefore notprofitable [41]. However, both López-Abelairas et al. [36] and Ghatnekar et al. [42] suggestedusing SDS as an additive to protect the polymer from degradation. It was indicated that at lowSDS concentration (<5%), the recovery costs are minimized [36].The main limitation of the chemical lysis method is that degradation of important polymerproperties, such as molecular weight and crystallinity, takes place due to the use of acids andalkalies [1, 6]. These properties determine the operating window and are crucial for furtherapplications of the polymer [36].Enzymatic lysisEnzymatic lysis is, like chemical lysis, based on degradation of the cell wall. Usually a mix ofvarious enzymes is used to obtain the best results, where a big advantage is the high selectivityof these enzymes that can improve both quality and quantity [2, 6]. This method is usuallycombined with a heat pretreatment to denaturate the cellular material and a surfactant treatmentto dissolve residual biomass [4, 7]. The high costs and complexity of design of the enzyme mixmakes enzymatic lysis not yet applicable at industrial scale [2, 7, 43].Mechanical lysisThe final method that is reported here is mechanical lysis, where shear forces are used to disruptbacteria and induce cell lysis. The main methods that are currently explored in literature are highpressure homogenizers (HPH) and bead mills, but ultrasonication of the cells is also frequentlyinvestigated [14].High pressure homogenization (HPH) is a widely applied method where the bacteria strain ispushed through a small gap where shear stress and friction cause disruption of the cell [21, 43].The forces can be influenced by altering the flow rate and pressure and by using multiple passesthe performance can be increased [43]. The HPH method was found to be efficient for largevolumes, but a major disadvantage is micronization of polymer particles during this process,which inevitably influences the complexity of the downstream separation process as well as thepolymer characteristics [10]. Ghatnekar et al. investigated the use of HPH as a cell disruptionmethod [42]. A strain of 10 g biomass/L required 3 passes to obtain fairly good yield and purity(95% and 80% respectively). With a strain at 17 g/L, Melih Tamer et al. reported the need ofmore than 8 passes to release 95% of the contained protein [44]. Sauer et al. and Ahmad-Raus etal. both obtained cell disruptions of above 90% within a few passes when introducing pressures6of 80 MPa or higher [45, 46]. Shear rates that can be obtained are in the 300-400 /s range [47,48]. Saavedra del Oso et al. reported fairly low downstream processing costs of only 0.26 e/kgPHA for mechanical and 0.77 e/kg PHA for chemical disruption, where the difference is mainlydue to the lower amount of chemicals used, indicating that quite good results can be obtainedwith this relatively inexpensive method [5].Another widely explored method is the bead mill, which is a simple method and reported to beeasily scalable [4]. The process consists of glass or ceramic beads suspended in a turning grindingchamber. The impact forces between cells and the beads or walls induce cell disruption [4, 10,43]. Melih Tamer et al. investigated the use of a bead mill for this application and reported onrelatively little micronization and a consistent and predictable disruption [44]. However, heatformation in the bead mill is a major problem and cooling should be taken into account [14].Combined methodsDespite their good performance and promising results in terms of costs and environmental im-pact, HPH and bead milling are not yet widely used on industrial scale [43]. Particle attritionand degradation obviously occurs under the high stress environment, even though thermal prop-erties are generally less affected [21]. On top of that, these methods are usually more feasible toscale up. However, they lack the selectivity of a chemical or enzymatic disruption, releasing allcytoplasmic components and causing difficulty in successive purification steps [43]. Therefore,multiple studies investigated the combination of mechanical and chemical disruption to find thebest of both worlds. A combination might even give better characteristics than either couldseparately achieve and mass transfer limitations could be lowered due to high mixing [1, 13].Anand et al. combined a mechanical disruption with a chemical pretreatment and obtained in-creased disruption compared to experiments without this pretreatment [32]. Another suggestionis washing with surfactant SDS to remove the released cytoplasmic components and simplifydownstream processing [5, 42, 44]. Ghatnekar et al. combined high pressure homogenizationwith SDS and showed increased yield and purity compared to the HPH using a normal buffer[42]. The yield went from 78% to 85% in a single pass at an operating pressure of 39 MPa.The purity increased from 77% to 88%, showing that this combination might be a promisingalternative for PHAs downstream processing.1.2.3 PurificationAfter precipitation, filtration or separation of the polymer from all cell mass, a washing step isusually applied to increase purity. Methods described in literature consist of a bleaching treat-ment with H2O2, the use of dissolution-precipitation cycles or ozone treatment [6, 14, 34]. Themain problems of the explored purification steps are the high energy intensity and degradationof the PHA due to the use of harsh solvents.1.3 Recovery using a MA-SDR reactorIn summary, the main problems that prevent PHAs from getting a competitive market positionare the highly complex fermentation process, the expensive carbon feedstock and the costly andenergy-intensive downstream processing [6, 13, 33]. As mentioned, a lot of research has beenperformed into optimizing the fermentation process, utilizing co-cultures or enabling the use ofwaste feedstocks. Studies from from Tamis et al. and Mulders et al. explored the possibilityof using organic waste and wastewater from candy factories or papermills and succeeded in7enriching a mixed microbial community under aerobic conditions [15, 30]. This seems verypromising and opens many doors, but still around 50% of the total process costs comes from thedownstream separation and purification of PHB, which is only complicated more by introducingmixed feed and bacterial cultures [5, 13, 33]. On top of that, the high amounts of toxic solventsand number of steps in the process make the recovery unfeasible and hard to scale up [7].Therefore, the development of a simple, feasible and more environmental friendly downstreamprocess is necessary. The previously studied mechanical methods such as high pressure homog-enization and bead milling lead to believe that there are many possibilities in using high shearas a disruption method for cells. An alternative that has been gaining a lot of attention overthe past decades and that might be able to provide high shear and intensified conditions is themembrane assisted spinning disk reactor (MA-SDR).1.3.1 The spinning disk reactorThe spinning disk reactor is stated to be at the basis of the process intensification research [49].Using a spinning disk reactor can significantly reduce the scale of a production process, dueto high mixing and highly increased mass transfer areas. This can decrease investment costs,reduce waste and even reduce the safety risk [49, 50]. Scale-up of the spinning disk reactor isfairly trivial, where you can base the necessary size, flow rate and rotational speed solely onsimple physical laws [49]. More often, simple numbering up methods are used.Generally, the inlet is at the center of the disk and liquids are pushed toward the edges due to thecentrifugal force [50]. This results in a flowing film on top of the disk, where the thickness andflow regime are determined by both liquid and spinning disk properties [50, 51]. The spinningdisk can be applied in liquid-liquid applications, where the mass transfer area is highly increaseddue to the rapid mixing, but also liquid-solid applications can benefit from this configurationand lower mass transfer limitations [52, 53]. Different types of stresses play a role inside thespinning disk reactor and the combination of these could possibly cause disruption of cells orparticles [52]. Shear rates higher than produced in an HPH can be reached, especially at theouter rim of the disk, leading to breakup if the particles and conditions are appropriate [54, 55].One important condition is the strain concentration. In a strain with low concentration, mostof the high shear will be exerted on the liquid, which dampens the effect it has on the bacteria[56]. With increased concentrations, shear will be less dampened and will have a higher impacton the bacteria and particles [57]. This leads to the necessity of increasing strain concentrationto a concentration that allows effective bacteria disruption.1.3.2 Membrane Assisted Spinning Disk Reactor (MA-SDR)With the above-mentioned requirements in mind, the MA-SDR seems the perfect candidate forthe downstream processing of PHAs. Membranes are nowadays extensively used as tools inprocess intensification and wastewater treatment plants and their ability to filter microparticlesfrom streams results in increasing use [58]. However, due to fouling and aging effects of polymericmembranes, regular replacement or cleaning is necessary [59]. These problems are reduced whenusing stainless steel membranes, which have higher costs, but are more durable and have a higherstability.The possibility of separating water from the strain, in order to increase retentate concentration,while causing bacteria breakup is an interesting combination that certainly needs further investi-8gation. The activity of the one also improves the effectiveness of the other, because by increasingstrain concentration, the shear rate exerted on the bacteria is increased. Inversely, the high mix-ing and shear rate caused by the disk at the membrane interface removes the non-permeatingparticles from the interface and increases the driving force for permeation by refreshing the in-terface concentrations [56]. The downside of using high shear rates is that degradation of thepolymer might occur, leading to a smaller processing window and reduced applicability [1]. Thisis crucial to take into account, as easier further processing also reduces cost and energy andinfluences the feasibility of applying PHAs on industrial scale.If this concept can obtain cellular disruption, it is likely that an MA-SDR can replace one ormore steps in downstream processing of PHA recovery. Moreover, it simplifies further separationsteps as no (large amounts of) toxic solvents are used, thereby also reducing the environmentalimpact. Additional advantages might be overall reduction in cost and energy demand, as wellas simplified corrections for varying strain properties.1.4 Scope and goalsIn this study, the possible intensification of the PHA recovery process is explored. The studyconsist of three distinguishable goals, which are formulated and extended below.Study and report the details of growing PHA-forming bacteria on lab scaleThis goal consists of an experimental investigation into the on-site production of bacteria thatare able to grow intracellular PHA. Growth and accumulation cycles as described in literatureand various characterization tools are used to obtain the details on this specific formation processon laboratory scale. These tools are described in chapter 2 and results are given in chapter 3.Study the opportunities of using a MA-SDR for intensification of the downstreamprocessing of PHA separationFor this goal, a parametric study is performed to obtain an idea of the possibility of using the MA-SDR in downstream processes, where on the one hand cell lysis and on the other hand possibledegradation effects due to high shear rates are taken into account. Both permeation behavior,crucial when trying to increase the strain concentration, and degradation that might occur dueto high shear rates in the MA-SDR are investigated. This is analyzed using a synthetic PHBsolution and several characterization techniques to quantify degradation in terms of thermal,chemical and crystalline properties as described in chapter 2. Results and discussion are shownin chapter 3.Study the possible large-scale implementation of an MA-SDR by designing the pro-cess and doing a techno-economic analysis using Aspen PlusLastly, a techno-economic assessment is performed to analyze the possible large-scale implemen-tation of the MA-SDR. The process is designed in Aspen Plus and compared to a conventionaldownstream process. The mass balances are solved and CAPEX and OPEX are calculated.A sensitivity analysis is performed to indicate the range of optimal conditions. Details on thedesign and the results and feasibility of this novel process are discussed in chapter 4.9Chapter 2MethodsIn this chapter, methods used in this study are described. The used chemicals are stated andan explanation is given on the setup of both the sequencing batch reactor and the membraneassisted spinning disk reactor. Additionally, the methods for characterization of bacteria andPHB are elaborated.2.1 ChemicalsTable 2.1 shows an overview of the chemicals that were used in this research in order of appear-ance in this chapter, including their molecular weight, supplier and grade.Table 2.1: List of chemicals, properties and suppliers used in this studyChemical (abbr.)

This sludge was placed in a 4 L sequencing batch reactor which is10shown schematically in Figure 2.1. The reactor was equipped with an impeller for continuousmechanical stirring at 150 rpm, a heating jacket at a temperature of 30 ◦C and oxygen supplyusing a sparger. A dissolved oxygen (DO) electrode was included to keep track of the oxygensaturation level, given in ppm, and a pH electrode was introduced to keep track of the pH. HClor NaOH were manually added to ensure a pH of 7-7.5 was maintained in the reactor. Lastly,peristaltic pumps were added to the setup to pump fresh medium and effluent from and intotheir respective storage tanks.Figure 2.1: Schematic overview of the setup of a bioreactorThe SBR was operated using feast-famine cycles of 24 h, which consisted of the following stages:settling of sludge (2.5 h), discharging effluent (0.3 h), pumping feed (0.3 h), aerated operating(20.9 h). Generally, 3.5 L of effluent was removed from the reactor and 3.5 L of fresh mediumwas added immediately after, resulting in a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 1.14 days. Thesolids retention time (SRT) was considerably higher, as it was desired to keep all solids in thereactor to enhance growth. The medium for the bacteria consisted of a carbon source, nutrientsand water. The carbon source consisted of 270 mM NaAc and the nutrient source of 67.5 mMNH4Cl, 24.9 mM KH2PO4, 5.55 mM MgSO4 and 7.2 mM KCl, following Johnson et al. [25]. Toprevent nitrification of the liquid, 100 mg/L of allylthiourea was added.Two bioreactors were installed and named SBR-1 and SBR-2. Initially, the same conditions wereapplied to both reactors, but varying concentrations were explored to provide for cycles withhigher retention times. This is discussed in chapter 3.2.2.2 Sequencing Batch Reactor for bacteria accumulationAdditional to the growth cycle, an accumulation cycle was performed. Once the biomass contentsof the reactors and acetic acid consumption were stable, the conditions for accumulation wereapplied. Temperature, pH and the SBR cycle were kept as previously mentioned, but the feedmedium was altered. For PHA accumulation, either nitrogen (NH4Cl) or phosphor (KH2PO4)can be limited. In this research, it was chosen to limit nitrogen to diminish growth and enhancePHA formation.112.2.3 Analytical methods for bacteria characterizationTotal Suspended Solids (TSS)The biomass concentration in the reactors was determined in terms of Total Suspended Solids(TSS) according to standard methods [60]. 20 mL of sludge was withdrawn after 2 hours of feastphase and passed through a 0.22 µm filter. The sample was dried at 103-105 ◦C for 1 h andweighed.High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is able to analyze dissolved compounds ina liquid sample and provide quantitative and qualitative analysis of the concentrations in thebioreactor at any point in time. The analysis was performed using a Shimadzu UFLC XRsystem, equipped with a Waters 2414 Refractive Index Detector. The column used was AminexHPX-87H with precolumn (300 x 7.8 mm, 9 µm), with oven temperature of 60 ◦C. The mobilephase was a 0.005 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, injected at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min (isocratic).An aliquot of 1 µL was taken for analysis, with a total time of analysis per sample of 30 min.Flow Cytometry (FC)In order to determine the effectiveness of the MA-SDR to induce cell lysis, the amount of liveand dead bacteria had to be quantified. Flow cytometry is a technique that can rapidly (up until10.000 events per second) determine relative size, internal complexity and fluorescence based onscattering of laser light in forward (FSC) and side (SSC) directions. Dead or dying bacteriaare smaller in size and the distinction can be made using this tool in order to determine thelive/dead ratio.In this research, a BD FACS Symphony A3 was used to determine the live/dead ratio of thestrain, where FSC, SSC and BB660 fluorescence are measured. At a flowrate of 12 µL/min a 15second measurement of the strain was recorded. The data registered by the flow cytometer wasanalyzed using the FlowJo v10.8.0 software. Intracellular PHA was stained using Nile Red, asNile Red attaches to the lipids surrounding the granules. A stock solution of 1 mg/mL of NileRed in acetone was prepared (excitation at 488 nm, emission at 510-580 nm [61, 62]). 20 mL ofstrain was reduced to 2 mL by centrifugation in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5702 at 3000g, afterwhich 20 µL of stock solution was added.(Fluorescence) Microscopy (FM): Fixation and staining protocolsSample preparation for (fluorescence) microscopy was done by mixing 1 mL phosphate buffer so-lution (PBS, prepared using 20.44 g Na2HPO4 and 6.72 g NH2PO4 in 1 L water [63]), 220 µL/minwith 1 mL of the bacteria strain. This was incubated at 4 ◦C overnight. The supernatant wasremoved by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in 3 mL PBS and washed three times.Finally, the sample was resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS and 0.5 mL cold ethanol and stored at 5-6◦C. Nile Red staining was done by adding 20 µL of stock solution after the first washing stepand incubating the sample for 30 minutes at 4 ◦C, after which the remaining washing steps wereperformed [64].A Leica DMi8 microscope with a Cherry-T filter for fluorescence was used to analyze the sam-ples. For bright-field microscopy, maximum magnification was 64x, whereas for fluorescencemicroscopy this was 32x. The images were edited using ImageJ.12Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for PHA contentWith thermogravimetric analysis, samples are continuously weighed, while the temperature isincreased. With this, a general estimation can be made of the PHA content of the biomass asthe polymer shows a distinct degradation curve at around 200-300 ◦C, dependent on conditionsbefore drying. Analysis was done with a PerkinElmer TGA 4000 Thermogravimetric Analyzer.For sample preparation, 50 mL of strain was centrifuged and dried in the oven at 60 ◦C for 24h.3-5 mg of dried biomass was loaded into the basket at initial temperature of 40 ◦C. The samplewas heated to 103 ◦C at 10 ◦C/min and kept at that temperature for 10 minutes to get rid ofresidual water. After the hold, heating was done until 550 ◦C at 10 ◦C/min, with an additionalhold at 30 minutes.2.3 Intensification using MA-SDRIn Figure 2.2 a schematic overview of the operated MA-SDR is given. This is a rotor-statorspinning disk reactor with a membrane at the bottom for permeation. The flow rate of thissetup can be altered from 60-330 mL/min and the rotational speed from 0-2000 rpm. Addi-tionally, a back pressure regulator can be adjusted to create a pressure difference and controlpermeation rate. First, a set of experiments was performed with water as the inlet fluid toinvestigate the permeation performance of the MA-SDR. Additionally, experiments were per-formed using a 2.5 g/L solution with synthetic PHB to observe both permeation performancewith a solids-containing flow and degradation of the synthetic PHB due to high shear in thespinning disk reactor. Degradation was measured using characterization methods as mentionedin the following sections. Further details on the experiments are provided in the correspondingsections in chapter 3.Figure 2.2: Schematic overview of the MA-SDR (dimensions in mm)2.3.1 Analytical methods for PHB characterizationThermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)Thermogravimetric analysis allows the determination of the degradation temperature by deter-mining the mass of the sample with increasing temperature. The degradation temperature is thetemperature at which severe degradation, such as depolymerization and random scission occur.This is an important parameter to determine as it influences the operational window and withthat the suitability of a polymer for certain applications. 3-5 mg of sample was loaded into the13basket of the TGA, which was set at an initial temperature of 50 ◦C. The program heated thesample from 50 ◦C until 500 ◦C at a heating rate of 20 ◦C/min.Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)In order to analyze the thermal properties of the polymer, differential scanning calorimetrycan be used, which allows the determination of the glass transition temperature, the meltingtemperature and enthalpy of fusion. The enthalpy of fusion can give an estimation of thecrystallinity of the polymer, which can be calculated using the enthalpy of fusion of a 100%crystalline polymer (∆H0f ), which is 146 J/g [13, 22, 36, 65]. The crystallinity is calculated asfollows:Xc =∆Hf∆H0f(2.1)A TA DSC2000 instrument was used for these measurement, where 5-15 mg dried polymer wasinserted using an aluminum hermetic pan. The temperature program is set to a heat/cool/heatcycle, from -40 ◦C to 200 ◦C (at a 5 ◦C/min heating and cooling rate) in order to avoid degra-dation of the polymer. A heat/cool/heat cycle was designed to erase thermal history of thesample by heating it above the melting temperature. The second heating curve then displaysthe real information of the sample, based on molecular weight and not on the thermal history.The software TRIOS 5.1.1 was used to analyze the data.14Chapter 3Results & DiscussionIn this chapter, results from the study on bacteria growth and accumulation on lab scale arepresented and discussed. Results of the parametric study with the MA-SDR are shown, perme-ation rates in cases of water and the PHB aqueous solution are measured and the effect of highshear on PHB degradation is explored using various characterization tools.3.1 Bacteria growth and accumulation3.1.1 SBR for bacteria growthThe results of the HPLC samples taken over all cycles are shown in Figure 3.1a and Figure 3.1b.The black squares (■) represent the acetic acid concentration at the start of the feast phase, rightafter feeding, and the white triangles (△) represent the concentration at the end of the faminephase. Additionally, the TSS values are shown. The light grey and white areas depict weeks,consisting of 5 cycles, except in the final weeks, where public holidays forbade experiments andthe weekends were longer.It can clearly be seen that with a feed concentration of 270 mmol/L NaAc (as described insection 2.2), the initial concentration of the strain was generally around 0.2-0.25 mol/L. Thisdifference is due to residual liquid in the reactors, as only 3.5 out of 4 liters were removed duringthe discharge state in order to prevent the discharge of active bacteria.Over the first weeks, both reactors gave highly fluctuating results. Consumption was not steadyas acetic acid removal fluctuated between 0-80%. Especially the results of SBR-1 show nocorrelation between consumption at different days. An important cycle to point out is cycle 11,where no oxygen was provided. It can clearly be seen that nearly no acetic acid was consumedby the bacteria. This stresses the important of oxygen during the feast phase. This lack ofoxygen might also be the cause of highly fluctuating results throughout the whole experiment,as the oxygen supply was manually turned on and off. No sparger was in place, because severeblockage occurred during the settling phase. After noting the crucial influence of oxygen on thefeast-famine cycle, care was taken to open the oxygen valve far enough to supply a saturatedoxygen level.15(a)(b)Figure 3.1: TSS and acetic acid concentration from every cycle of (a) SBR-1 and (b) SBR-2.The light grey and white areas depict weeks. The area highlighted in orange depicts the cycleswhere accumulation conditions are provided.16Even though oxygen was lacking during cycle 11, the first TSS measurement was performed,showing concentrations of 0.18 and 0.45 g/L for SBR-1 and SBR-2, respectively. As the TSSwas taken after 3 hours of feasting, the lack of oxygen (and thus acetic acid consumption) of thatcycle had no severe degrading effect on the TSS yet. The influence of acetic acid consumptionon TSS is discussed later in this chapter.Noticeably, from cycle 14 on, both SBRs showed a constant consumption of acetate and despitethe fluctuating concentrations of the previous cycles, all acetate was consumed throughout thefollowing cycles. Especially the results of SBR-2 show a very steady depleted strain throughoutcycles 14-38. The importance of oxygen during a cycle is again stressed when looking at the fewexemptions in acetate consumption (cycle 20-23 and 27-28). These follow the exact same patternin both SBRs, which leads to believe that these are again caused by oxygen limitations as bothSBRs were connected to the same supply tubing. Looking at the TSS, this was measured tobe steady over the cycles 20-37 for SBR-2 and remained around 0.2-0.28 g/L. SBR-2 showed aslightly increasing TSS over cycle 20-30, but remained within the same range until cycle 40. Thevalues found are lower than reported in literature under the same conditions [25, 29]. However,as was also shown in literature, slight changes in conditions (temperature, pH, oxygen supply)can affect the growth and consumption immensely and if these are not carefully tuned highdeviations can occur. In this setup, concentrations remained around 0.2-0.3 g/L for multipleweeks at similar conditions, which leads to believe that this is the maximum concentrationachievable in this setting.Usually after a weekend (two full days of famine phase) a lot of foaming, the sign of cell death,occurred. Based on this, the decision was made to increase the concentrations of carbon sourceand nutrients to stretch the feast and famine phases over the weekend. This can be seen inboth SBRs in cycles 29, 34 and 46 (triple concentrations), and in cycles 38 and 42 (quadrupleconcentrations). It was seen that SBR-2 is usually depleted of acetic acid after a weekend,confirming the presence of a famine phase even though the time span could be short. SBR-1showed only consumption of ∼50% and had an excess of acetate over multiple days. From cycle29 on, substantial differences in performance between the two SBRs were measured, even thoughthe same conditions were applied continuously.As mentioned before, the consumption of acetate during one cycle had a high influence onthe TSS measured during the subsequent cycle. In several cases (cycle 29-30 and 34-35) theTSS increased with about 40% after increased acetic acid concentration, nearing values foundin literature [25, 29]. However, this increase was usually already diminished 2 cycles after.This effect of acetate consumption can also clearly be seen from cycle 41-43 in SBR-1. A lowconsumption (<0.01 molAc/L) during cycle 41 resulted in a low TSS (<0.15 g/L) in cycle 42,but during cycle 42 a lot of acetic acid was consumed (∼0.05 molAc/L) and the TSS immediatelyincreased back to original values. The cause of this, could be that increased concentrations givethe bacteria a boost and allow for a lot of growth. When fed the original concentrations in thesubsequent cycle, the acetate is no longer sufficient to provide for these high amounts of biomass.This also leads to believe that over all cycles, the carbon source might have been the limitingfactor in obtaining higher biomass concentrations.As SBR-1 was still underperforming, acetate concentrations were doubled from cycle 40 onwardto observe if this increase in driving force for consumption was necessary for the bacteria toconsume more than 0.05 g/L. However, this did not result in more consumption, which is whythe feed is set back to the original concentrations.From cycle 44 onward, the decision was made to start applying accumulation conditions for17SBR-2. Further explanation and analysis of the results is given in subsection 3.1.3.3.1.2 Bacteria characterizationCharacterization with FCIn Figure 3.2a and Figure 3.2b the results of the flow cytometry measurements are shown. Thesamples were taken during feast and famine of cycle 32 and 31 respectively. The red sample (•)was taken at the beginning of cycle 32 (feast phase), and the light blue sample (•) was takenat the end cycle 31 (famine phase). First, the results of SSC vs FSC are shown. As shortlymentioned in chapter 2, SSC (side scatter) is a measure for internal complexity and FSC (forwardscatter) is a measure for relative size. PHA-containing bacteria are expected to have a higherinternal complexity and size compared to empty biomass, leading to higher values on both axes.The doublets (particles that pass through the detector together and appear as one big particle)are excluded in these results.(a) (b)Figure 3.2: FC results of (a) SBR-1 and (b) SBR-2, showing SSC vs FSC for feast phase (•) andfamine phase (•). Black lines separate the different quadrants.In Figure 3.2a, gates have been applied to distinguish between the separate quadrants. Thesequadrants were visible for both feast and famine phase of SBR-1, but SBR-2 displayed twostrains with similar properties in terms of size and internal complexity. During the feast phase,SBR-1 showed a clear distribution in internal complexity (SSC-A) and both Q1 and Q3 containedabout 14.5% of all measured particles. 6.5% of the particles was in Q2 and had both high relativeinternal complexity and higher relative size. This internal complexity was reduced in the faminephase, where Q1 contained only 2.7%, Q2 only 1.4% and Q3 contained 32.3% of all particles.In the famine phase, the distribution in size was more pronounced, which is most likely causedby growth of the particles after consuming acetic acid. Based on this, it is expected that if aTSS was measured during the famine phase, this would result in higher values. The reductionin internal complexity is caused by the reduction in PHA-containing bacteria, resulting in lessside scattering.18The results from SBR-2 can not be analyzed similarly and both feast and famine phase showedthe same distribution. More analysis on both SBRs is given later in this chapter. It is likelythat SBR-2 was not creating any PHB-containing bacteria and a different bacteria strain wasdominant.(a) (b)Figure 3.3: FC results of (a) SBR-1 and (b) SBR-2, showing SSC vs BB660 for feast phase (•)and famine phase (•). The gate encircles the internally complex particles and correspondingfraction.In Figure 3.3a and Figure 3.3b the results of the same strain and cycle are shown, but nowthe internal complexity is shown versus BB660-A, which is the fluorescence of NR measured bythe instrument. As PHA granules inside the bacteria are surrounded by a lipid layer, NR willstain and show high fluorescence for bacteria containing PHA. The gates applied to both figuressurround particles with high fluorescence, and high internal complexity. During feast phase,SBR-1 had 21.8% of the particles in this gate, whereas for the famine phase this gate containedonly 4.1%. Here again, a clear difference is thus observed between the feast and famine phase,with the feast phase showing both higher complexity and higher fluorescence. This time, SBR-2did show interesting results, but again, in both cases exactly the same. For both feast and faminephase, 15.8% of the particles were more internally complex and showed fluorescence. Based onthese results, one would state that, especially in SBR-1, PHA was present. SBR-2 could alsohave had the PHB-containing bacteria, but this could not be measured with this technique. Thiswas further analyzed using fluorescence microscopy and TGA.Characterization with FMDuring cycle 43 samples were taken for the fluorescence microscopy. The results are shown inFigure 3.4 and Figure 3.5 for SBR-1 and SBR-2, respectively. In both cases, the bacteria formednice agglomerates of around 200 µm in size due to the fixation protocol. However, a lot ofindividual particles remained. In upcoming measurements, a higher formaldehyde concentrationcan be used to increase fixation.Looking at both bright-field images, even though the many layers of bacteria complicate ob-taining a sharp image, many separate particles can be distinguished. Especially Figure 3.4a19clearly shows white particles, with the approximate size of bacteria. Comparing this with thefluorescent image on the right side, the positions seem to overlap. Considering the fact that Nilered will again highly stain the intracellular lipids, it is likely that each fluorescent dot depicts abacteria, either with or without intracellular PHA. When shifting the focus of the microscope,different layers appeared with more highly fluorescing dots. In total, this resulted in vague greenareas with high agglomeration.(a) Bright-field microscopy image (b) Fluorescence microscopy imageFigure 3.4: SBR-1 microscopy images (32x magnification), stained with Nile red.(a) Bright-field microscopy image (b) Fluorescence microscopy imageFigure 3.5: SBR-2 microscopy images (32x magnification), stained with Nile red.20The biggest difference between SBR-1 and SBR-2 found here is that the particles in SBR-1seemed more dinstinguishable and slightly bigger in size. This can either be caused by thepresence of different bacteria strains in the SBRs, or the formation of PHA is just more visi-ble in SBR-1. These results, however, do not allow a definitive conclusion on the presence ofintracellular PHA and higher magnifications will be required to do so.Characterization with TGAThe rapid degradation of PHA at temperatures above 200 ◦C, allows an estimation of the cellularPHA content using thermogravimetric analysis [66]. First, the ash content was determined. Thisis assumed to be the leftover mass after the isothermal stop at 550 ◦C. For SBR-1 this was about27 wt.%, whereas for SBR-2 this was slightly higher at 29 wt.%.Of both SBRs, two samples were taken and compared. As previously done with the microscopysamples, one sample was taken during the feast phase in cycle 37 and the other sample, furtherassumed to be the depleted sample, was taken at the end of the famine phase of cycle 38. Ascould be seen in Figure 3.1a and Figure 3.1b, at the end of cycle 38 SBR-2 was completelydepleted of acetate, while still 0.03 mol/L was left in SBR-1 at that time. Thus, there was noactual feast-famine cycle for SBR-1 in this period, which could lead to incorrect results.Figure 3.6: SBR-2 sample weight loss (W ) and weight loss rate (dW/dT ) as a function oftemperature at 10 ◦C/min heating rate. The area highlighted in orange depicts the supposedPHA.In Figure 3.6 the results of SBR-2 are plotted, showing weight loss and its derivative as a functionof temperature. The difference between the feast and famine results can be seen in the high peakat 234 ◦C, depicting PHA formed during the feast phase. The peak at ∼320 ◦C most likely showsthe degradation of bacterial lipids. Using the famine phase as a background, integration led toan estimation of the PHA fraction in biomass, as was performed in previous works [66]. ForSBR-2, this fraction was found to be 16.25 wt.%. This fraction does not approach the fractionsmeasured in literature during normal growth conditions, but is reasonable and shows that PHAformation is at least possible [25]. Additionally, taking a sample 30 minutes earlier or later c
