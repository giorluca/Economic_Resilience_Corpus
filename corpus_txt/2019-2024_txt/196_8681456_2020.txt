The oil and gas industry as the biggest supplier to address this demand for energy still plays the major role in the energy market and has an extensive influence on the energy price. Increasing the economic efficiency of the processes and the energy-producing systems in this industry can therefore significantly contribute to securing energy affordability. With the ever-increasing application of data in the oil and gas industry, its availability and accuracy are of vital importance in hydrocarbon field management and increasing the economic recovery of oil and gas. Perhaps the most important type of data in the oil and gas industry are production flow rates which is a basis of decisions in hydrocarbon field management. In many cases, however, the production data of wells contain large flow measurement uncertainties or are not available continuously due to the shortcomings of the traditional methods of flow measurement or estimation that are still used in the industry. This research has investigated the effects of these uncertainties on the economic recovery of oil and gas reservoirs and tried to propose solutions for mitigating them. In order to do that, the uncertainties in the production data have been statistically analysed and the effects of the frequency of flow tests on the accuracy of allocation calculations and hydrocarbon accounting have been investigated (Chapter 3). The case studies in the analysis showed up to 80 million dollars reduction in the annual cost of allocation uncertainties when flow tests were undertaken weekly instead of monthly in an oil field with 36 production wells. Based on the statistical analysis, a method that includes the application of an artificial neural network has been proposed to find the minimum frequency of flow tests required to achieve a desired allocation error (Chapter 4). The effects of the uncertainties of flow data on history matching and well testing (Chapter 5), which are two main exercises contributing to reservoir management, have been investigated subsequently. The results show the significance of the negative effect of systematic errors and therefore the importance of regular calibration and maintenance of flow meters, installing multi-phase flow meters on individual wells, and recording the data downhole instead of on the surface.

This is equivalent to 2.55 million households in England who cannot afford to keep their houses warm during the winter. The statistics in some other areas of the world show even worse situations as a result of the high price of energy and poor economies (Bouzarovski and Petrova 2015; International Energy Agency (IEA) 2019a). Figure 1.1 shows a world atlas of total primary energy supply (TPES) per capita. TPES is an indication of energy consumption. Comparing this figure with the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita statistics of countries around the world (United Nations 2019) shows that those countries which are at the bottom of energy consumption tables are normally the same countries that have the weakest economies. The entire aforementioned argument implies that energy affordability is still a major problem in our world. Therefore, at the same time as moving towards clean sustainable energy sources, the affordability of energy also needs to improve.   Figure 1.1: World atlas of total primary energy supply (TPES) per capita (toe stands for a tonne of oil equivalent) (International Energy Agency (IEA) 2019b).  2  Although our energy supply is now produced from a wider range of sources, such as photovoltaic and thermal solar, the tides or wind and for some countries, a nuclear power base load, there still remains an important role for the oil and gas industry in the energy sector. Figure 1.2 displays the contribution of different sources in primary energy consumption around the world. Oil is still the largest energy source making over a 34% contribution and natural gas is in the third place providing almost 24% of the total consumption and increasing. It means the energy sector is still largely dependent on the oil and gas industry which supplies more than half (58%) of global primary energy. This dependency means that the oil and gas industry remains in a very important position in determining the price of energy and its security.    Figure 1.2: The contribution of different sources in primary energy consumption around the world (British Petroleum 2019). Oil is still the biggest energy source.   Not only do changes in the price of hydrocarbon products directly affect consumers, but also they have an immediate influence on the price of energy from other sources, such as renewables. One main factor in determining the price of energy is therefore the daily price of oil. Figure 1.3 shows the changes in the price of oil from 1861 to 2018. Although the figure shows peaks over time, the overall price trend shows an increase, especially after 1973 Gulf War that a sharp increase is observed. While world events have created a significant effect, 3  mostly temporary, on the oil price, the main reason for the current higher price compared to the past is the energy demand increase, in spite of the global economic turndown in 2010. Therefore, to maintain a reasonable price for energy and to maintain its affordability, especially for poorer societies, the energy supply needs to increase as fast as demand. This is, however, not the only factor that contributes to keeping energy affordable. Increasing the economic efficiency of energy-producing systems is another important element.    Figure 1.3: Changes in the price of oil from 1861 to 2018 (British Petroleum 2019). The total trend in the price increasing especially after 1973.   Since the oil and gas industry is still the main global supplier of energy, any method that can increase the efficiency of the production processes in this industry can reduce the price of energy and ameliorate energy poverty. Higher efficiency oil and gas production also reduces the costs of operating companies and increases oil and gas reserves (i.e. the amount of oil and gas that is financially feasible to be recovered considering production costs and the hydrocarbon price). Hence, higher efficiency not only increases the total recovery of oil and 4  gas, but also, more importantly, the total ‚Äòeconomic‚Äô recovery of oil and gas. Economic recovery is referred to the financial benefits of oil and gas production after considering all of its costs. Maximising economic recovery of oil and gas within existing laws and regulations (Energy Act 2016; Environmental Protection Act 1990; Petroleum Act 1998), such as regulations in regard to protecting the environment or health and safety, is the aim of oil and gas producing companies. An efficient field management programme must therefore be undertaken by companies to achieve these goals. Hydrocarbon field management, especially in its modern form, includes dealing with a large amount of data coming from different sources, such as production facilities, simulators, formation evaluation tests, and rock and fluid laboratories. Decisions about how to operate a field are made based on these sets of data. An important element of this data (perhaps the most important) is the production flowrates from wells in a reservoir that has a fundamental role in the reservoir management, production optimisation, decision-making process, hydrocarbon accounting, and tax payment. The accuracy of the production data can therefore directly (in hydrocarbon accounting) or indirectly (in reservoir management) affect the economic recovery of oil and gas. Larger measurement or estimation uncertainties in the flow rate data mean a higher cost of production for oil and gas companies and a lower energy production efficiency. This lower efficiency can potentially have an influence on the energy market and the final cost of energy for consumers. As a consequence, mitigating the uncertainty in the production flow rate data of oil and gas fields can play a role in increasing the economic recovery of oil and gas and providing affordable energy to the market.   1.2 Thesis overview 1.2.1 Aims and objectives The production from wells in the oil and gas industry mainly includes three fluids: oil, gas, and water. Operators normally have to deal with multi-phase flows that add to the complexity of any flow measurement exercise. The uncertainty in the recorded production flow rates is therefore large in many hydrocarbon fields around the world. This uncertainty, as mentioned above, can potentially increase the cost of production and reduce the economic recovery of oil and gas. The aim of this research is to provide recommendations and methods to increase the 5  economic recovery of oil and gas through mitigating the uncertainty in the production data. The exact effect of this uncertainty on the economic recovery, however, is not clear. To achieve the aim of this research, therefore, a thorough understanding of the influence of these uncertainties on the whole process of oil and gas production was required. The main research questions of this thesis are ‚Ä¢ Which exercises in the oil and gas production process can potentially be affected by flow measurement uncertainties? ‚Ä¢ Are the effects of the uncertainties on these processes significantly costly and can they reduce the economic recovery of oil and gas? ‚Ä¢ Are there any methods that can mitigate the uncertainties or their cost and ultimately increase the economic recovery of oil and gas?  Hence, the objectives of this research to attain its aim and answer the questions are ‚Ä¢ Determining hydrocarbon production exercises in which flow measurement data is employed widely ‚Ä¢ Finding potential direct and indirect links between production flow rate uncertainties and the economic recovery of oil and gas in these exercises ‚Ä¢ Estimating the cost of the uncertainties for operators by undertaking case studies, simulations, and data analysis ‚Ä¢ Presenting recommendations for cost reduction based on the data analysis  The research was focused on the role of flow measurement uncertainties in hydrocarbon accounting and reservoir management. In hydrocarbon accounting, the uncertainties have a direct and clear effect on the operating costs (OPEX) of oil and gas companies, while in reservoir management their effect is indirect and subtle.  1.2.2 Thesis structure Different techniques are employed in the industry to monitor or estimate production flow rates. The most common method is still undertaking occasional flow tests on individual wells, although the application of other methods, such as multi-phase flow meters (MPFM) or virtual flow meters, has increased recently. In Chapter 2 of this thesis, these different methods of flow measurement or flow rate estimations in the oil and gas industry are explained. The common 6  errors and uncertainties which are associated with flow rate data are also discussed. This research has had two main phases; the first phase on the effects flow measurement uncertainties on allocation and hydrocarbon accounting and the second phase on the effects of these uncertainties on reservoir management. The results of the first phase are presented in Chapters 3 and 4 and the results of the second phase are discussed in Chapters 5. Chapter 3 is dedicated to statistical analysis of the uncertainties and investigating their effects on allocation and hydrocarbon accounting calculations. Based on the analysis in Chapter 3, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed and trained and the results of the application of this ANN for reducing the errors of allocation calculations are presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 is written on the role of flow measurement in reservoir management. The first section of Chapter 5 details effect of flow measurement errors on history matching which is a main sub-process of reservoir management. The second section of the chapter, however, discusses this role in well testing, another main element of reservoir management. Conclusions and recommendations of this PhD research are summarised in Chapter 6. 7  Chapter 2: Flow measurement in the oil and gas industry  2.1 Introduction Flow measurement has an important role in the oil and gas industry. Flow meters are widely used to measure the flow of producing fluids from the reservoir or the injection of fluids into it. The data from the meters is used for different purposes, such as hydrocarbon accounting and reservoir management. In the case of hydrocarbon accounting, the amount of hydrocarbons which is transferred between operators or sold need to be recorded with an acceptable accuracy to enable operators to perform financial calculations and governments to determine taxation revenues. In many cases, producing fluids from different wells or oil fields are commingled and the total outcome is retrospectively allocated to the owners. Allocating the flow in an equitable way requires accurate flow measurement data. Therefore, flow meters are vital for hydrocarbon accounting in the oil and gas industry. Moreover, the production or injection data measured by flow meters can be analysed and used to secure a better management over the reserves. Since proper management can increase the recovery of oil and gas, the collected flow measurement data also has an indirect effect on the recovery factor of oil and gas reservoirs. In this chapter, the role of flow measurement in the oil and gas industry is discussed. In the following sections, different methods of flow measurement in the oil and gas industry are presented. Then, the application of flow meters in fiscal measurements, custody transfer, and hydrocarbon accounting are explained. Finally, the important role of flow measurement data in history matching, optimisation and reservoir management is elaborated.  2.2 The role of flow measurement in hydrocarbon accounting Hydrocarbon accounting is also referred to as hydrocarbon production reporting or allocation. Although it can include a variety of activities in the oil and gas industry, the main aim of hydrocarbon accounting is to track and measure reservoir producing fluids, especially when they are being transferred from one owner to another or determining the share of each owner from the total production when production from different fields or wells is commingled. The amount of tax that should be paid to the government by the operator is also determined through hydrocarbon accounting. The accuracy of the measurements and methods which are used in 8  the hydrocarbon accounting process is important since a failure in providing acceptable measurements results in a non-fair distribution of the revenues between the owners. In addition, it can prevent sellers from being able to determine the correct price of the hydrocarbon that they are delivering to the next owners. Therefore, different guidelines have been developed in different countries to specify the required measurement accuracies for hydrocarbon accounting. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the details of the regulations for hydrocarbon measurements have been provided by the Oil & Gas Authority (2015). It is not just flow meters that control the accuracy of hydrocarbon accounting, however. Other software and hardware facilities are also involved in this process. Therefore, in addition to the accuracy of flow meters, the accuracy of the employed methods, calculations, and facilities are also important in the entire process. The role of these factors in the accuracy of hydrocarbon accounting can be different from one case to another depending on the design of the production facilities, the number of owners, or the necessity of back allocation. In the case where there is just one owner and the measurement is performed for equitable custody transfer, the role of flow meters is of the highest importance. However, when there is commingled production from different owners and back allocation is needed to determine the share, the methods of allocation have vital importance in addition to the accuracy of the flow meters. Chapter 3 and 4 of this thesis focus on hydrocarbon accounting and allocation and have presented a method to reduce their uncertainty. Custody transfer involves the activities which are necessary to determine the price of hydrocarbon production fluids which are transferred from a seller to a buyer. The terms ‚Äòcustody transfer‚Äô and ‚Äòfiscal measurement‚Äô are often interchangeable. However, in some references, fiscal measurement has been defined as being more general than custody transfer. In those references, fiscal measurement includes both custody transfer and allocation.  Allocation (or back allocation) is the act of determining the share of each source when the producing fluids from different sources are mixed. The sources are normally for different owners which makes allocation necessary to determine the income of each. Section 2.4.3 of this chapter explains more about allocation techniques.   9  2.3 The role of flow measurement in reservoir management Many hydrocarbon reservoirs are located deep under the surface of the earth. This means that the reservoir is an unknown system for us, there is a limited access to it, and gathering information about the reservoir is difficult. Different methods have been developed and employed to obtain information from hydrocarbon reservoirs. Among these are seismic (Bacon, Simm and Redshaw 2007; Vermeer 2002), reservoir rock and fluid sample analysis (Sch√∂n 2015; Tiab and Donaldson 2015), formation evaluation (Darling 2005), and well testing (Bourdet 2002; Horne 1995; Lee 1982). All the information that can be obtained from all of these methods, however, cannot give an accurate image of the reservoir. Knowing the characteristics of a hydrocarbon reservoir such as its size, the initial amount of oil in place, the reservoir rock and fluid properties (e.g. porosity, permeability, fluid viscosity, and fluid density), location of faults, type and location of the reservoir boundaries, and characteristics of aquifers is necessary for the operating companies. It enables them to have an integrated management over their hydrocarbon reservoirs and maximise their income from the reserves. Although these characteristics are measured or estimated using the aforementioned methods, there is still a vast uncertainty in the knowledge they provide from a reservoir (Babak and Deutsch 2008). Therefore, operators record and analyse any type of reservoir data that can help them reduce the uncertainty in the reservoir knowledge. Production data (i.e. oil, water and gas production flow rates, and downhole or wellhead pressure) can be analysed in an inverse problem to calculate the characteristics of a reservoir (for instance in well testing) or to mitigate the uncertainty in the reservoir model through history matching. History matching, well testing and other analyses based on production data are inverse problems. In a forward problem, by knowing the parameters of a system, the outputs of the system can be estimated. In contrast, in an inverse problem the characteristics of the system are unknown (Kern 2016; Kirsch 2011; Oliver, Reynolds and Liu 2008). In such a problem the outputs of the system are used to calculate the parameters of the system. Forward and inverse problems are shown in Figure 2.1. 10                            Figure 2.1: Forward and inverse problems. History matching and well testing are two inverse problems in reservoir engineering.  Proper reservoir management requires the solving of many inverse problems and dealing with numerous uncertainties. Therefore, the quality of the output data is of vital importance. Production data of the reservoir (oil, gas, and water flow rates and pressure data) is the main output of the reservoir system. Therefore, the data needs to be measured properly or estimated by using appropriate methods, then recorded for later analysis. In order to achieve this, different methods and technologies of flow measurement are used, such as single-phase flow meters, multi-phase flow meters (MPFM), virtual flow metering, and allocation. Moreover, the way that the measurement is undertaken and the interval between measurements vary in different oil and gas fields. The interval between measurements can vary from a near real time flow measurement, where multi-phase flow meters are used, to several weeks where regular production tests are undertaken using test separators. In addition, the hardware, software, and methods which are used have different accuracies. All of these factors affect the quality of the recorded data and can then indirectly affect reservoir management and hydrocarbon recovery.  Reservoir management is a complicated process involving setting targets, making decisions, implementing the decisions, recording the results, analysing the data, and then modifying the initial decisions (Satter, Varnon and Hoang 1994). The fundamentals of reservoir management have been presented in different publications (Al-Hussainy and Humphreys 1996; Satter, Varnon and Hoang 1994; Thakur 1996; Trice Jr and Dawe 1992). A recently introduced method referred to as Closed-Loop Reservoir Management (CLRM) is presented in the following section and has been employed in this research to show the role of flow measurement in reservoir management. Although CLRM is a relatively new method in reservoir management, SystemForward  problemDataInverse problem11  several publications from different authors who have employed it can be found in the literature (Barros, Van den Hof and Jansen 2016; Hanssen, Codas and Foss 2017; Jansen et al. 2005; Jansen, Brouwer and Douma 2009; Lorentzen, Shafieirad and Naevdal 2009; Wang, Li and Reynolds 2009). The main advantage of the CLRM method over other management methods is that it has a standard procedure that clearly and simply shows the contribution of different components of reservoir management, including production data, to the entire process. This advantage makes it an appropriate method for investigating the effects of different parameters, such as the quality of data on the reservoir management. A schematic of CLRM which has been presented in the literature by Jansen, Brouwer and Douma (2009) is shown in Figure 2.2.  Figure 2.2: Closed-Loop Reservoir Management (CLRM) process (Jansen, Brouwer and Douma 2009).   The two main components in CLRM are the actual reservoir and the reservoir model. In order to manage the actual reservoir and meet the targets that have been set for the exploitation process, a reservoir model that properly represents the actual reservoir is necessary. The operators cannot examine their plans on the actual reservoir in a trial and error method since it will affect the production and recovery of the reservoir. In addition to that, since the life of a reservoir is normally of the order of tens of years, it takes a long time to see the results of their decisions on the actual reservoir and then modify them. Alternatively, a reservoir model based on the characteristics of the reservoir can be built in a simulator. Many decisions and modifications are made based on the simulations that are performed on the reservoir model. If 12  the reservoir model is similar to the actual reservoir, the results of the simulations will be similar to what actually happens in the reservoir in the future. Otherwise, the model cannot represent the actual reservoir. In such a case, the decisions made based on the model will not be the best decisions for the actual reservoir and will make it difficult for the operators to set proper goals and reach their desired targets. Therefore, as has been shown in Figure 2.2, all the information that is obtained from geology, seismic, well logs, well tests, and reservoir fluid and rock sample analysis is employed to build a better reservoir model. However, since the information obtained from the reservoir is vastly uncertain, the reservoir model still cannot represent the actual reservoir accurately. This uncertainty in the model needs to be reduced and the model modified over time. This process is performed in the sub-loop of history matching. In the history matching loop, the outputs of the model are compared to the measured outputs of the reservoir. Based on the comparison, the model is then modified in an iterative procedure. There is also another sub-loop for reservoir optimisation. During the optimisation, the optimum values for production parameters that can be controlled by the operator, such as production rates or the location of the new wells, are determined. The CLRM itself has a main loop that connects all of the components in the reservoir management process. The loop enables the reservoir management to change from an intermittent process to a dynamic, near continuous one. It relates the outputs of the reservoir to its inputs. In other words, the decisions as to how to control the input parameters are made based on the outputs of the system or the way that the reservoir reacts to changing input parameters. The effect of the outputs of the reservoir on its inputs shows the importance of the quality of the recorded data. Any possible errors in the recorded outputs affect history matching, the reservoir model, optimisation, and finally the inputs (controls) of the reservoir. Therefore, the performance of the reservoir and its recovery factor are influenced by the quality of the recorded data. Since the production flow rates are important parts of the reservoir output, one main focus of this research is on the role of flow measurement in reservoir management and hydrocarbon recovery.  Flow measurement errors in hydrocarbon accounting is important for oil and gas companies because they can directly affect the share of each owner from the production of the field. When it comes to reservoir management, however, the effect of flow measurement on the income of the companies is not direct and clear. Operators normally deal with large uncertainties in the reservoir itself. In many cases, the effect of the uncertainties in the flow measurement data is ignored in comparison to other large uncertainties in the process or in the reservoir. The focus of many researchers and professionals has therefore been on quantifying and reducing the 13  uncertainties in the reservoir characteristics (Ahmadinia et al. 2019; Babak and Deutsch 2008; Oliver and Chen 2011). Since production data is used in mitigating uncertainties in the reservoir model (e.g. uncertainties in porosity, permeability, reservoir size, reservoir shape, and location of faults), however, the uncertainties in the data can impact this process. Therefore, investigating the effects of these uncertainties on the reservoir management is necessary. This issue has been addressed in this research.  In the following sections, some main parts of a reservoir management process that can significantly be affected by flow measurement uncertainties are discussed. The two main sub-processes of reservoir management, history matching and optimisation, in addition to well testing, are briefly explained in this chapter and the role of flow measurement in them has been elaborated. In Chapter 5 of this thesis, the effects of flow measurement errors on history matching and well testing which are two main exercises of reservoir management that directly employ flow measurement data have been discussed in details, respectively.  2.3.1 History matching As stated previously, history matching is an inverse problem and its aim is to mitigate the uncertainties in the reservoir model. Since there are limitations in the methods that are currently available to gather data from the reservoir, there is normally a large uncertainty in the initial reservoir models, which are built based on the data. The data is gathered through geological investigations, seismic, well logging, well testing, and reservoir rock and fluid sample analysis. All of these sources of information have limitations and the accuracy of the technology and the methods which are used affect the accuracy of the obtained data. As an example, since the number of wells that are drilled in a reservoir is limited, the number of areas of the reservoir in which rock and fluid samples can be taken is restricted. The characteristics of these samples, such as porosity, absolute permeability, relative permeability, fluid viscosities, and fluid densities are measured in laboratories. However, since actual reservoirs are heterogeneous in their characteristics, the measured values in the laboratory based on a limited number of samples do not necessarily represent the characteristics of the entire reservoir. The measured values of a parameter or average of them may be used in the simulator to build the entire reservoir model, or a part of it, but such a model cannot accurately represent the actual reservoir. Due to heterogeneity, the value that is used as the average value of a parameter in the model is normally different from the actual average value of that parameter in the reservoir. 14  Therefore, the initial model cannot forecast the future production accurately and it needs to be modified. History matching is widely used in the oil and gas industry to modify reservoir models. In order to do that, the actual production data of the reservoir (observed data) is compared with the simulated production data obtained from the model. If the two sets of results do not match, the model is modified in an iterative procedure. In each iteration, the results of the model are again checked against the observed data. If the match is not acceptable the model is modified again, and the iterative procedure is continued until an acceptable match is achieved. Figure 2.3 shows the iterative process of history matching.          Figure 2.3: The iterative procedure of history matching. The aim of history matching is to reduce the uncertainties in the reservoir model.  The loop of history matching is employed to reduce the uncertainties in the measured or estimated input data (Figure 2.3). Although other uncertainties such as those related to the model selection or governing equations also exist, the history matching case study in this research will focus on  input parameters such as porosity and permeability because they are very important in reservoir engineering calculations and there are typically large uncertainties associated with their estimated values. Flow measurement data (observed data) has an important role in this process. The data is used as the reference for history matching to show how accurate the results of the model are. However, similar to the input data of the model, there is normally an uncertainty in the flow measurement. In other words, the reference data that is Reservoir model Production rates from the model Actual production data ‚Ä¢ Reservoir rock and fluid samples ‚Ä¢ Well testing ‚Ä¢ Seismic, etc. Reservoir characteristics (porosity, permeability, etc.) History matching Flow measurement uncertainty Uncertainties in the input data 15  used to reduce the uncertainty in the model, normally has some uncertainty in itself. This uncertainty has a potential effect on the performance of the history matching and the accuracy of the model. Since there are normally large uncertainties in reservoir models, the uncertainty in the observed data is ignored in the oil and gas industry in many cases. However, depending on the method of flow measurement protocol being used, this uncertainty can be large and its effect can be significant. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of flow measurement uncertainties on history matching. Evaluating this effect can assist the operators in improving their methods of flow measurement and data collection and subsequently obtain more accurate results from history matching and their reservoir models. This is one aim of Chapter 5 of this thesis.  2.3.2 Optimisation Optimisation is the second sub-loop in CLRM (Figure 2.2) after the sub-loop of history matching. The aim of an optimisation process is to achieve the possible peak economic recovery of the reserves. An objective function, such as the ultimate hydrocarbon recovery or net present value (NPV), is therefore chosen that needs to be maximised within the existing constraints (Wheaton 2016). This is undertaken through an optimisation process by finding the best operating conditions or values for the controllable inputs of the reservoir. Some examples of these controllable inputs are the development plan (Vasantharajan, Al-Hussainy and Heinemann 2006), such as the location and number of the new wells and platforms (Bangerth et al. 2006), the water injection rates in a water flooding process (Lien et al. 2008; Peters et al. 2010), and the gas injection rate in a gas lifting exercise (Bahadori, Ayatollahi and Moshfeghian 2001; Wilson 2015). The optimisation process, however, directly or indirectly through the history matching exercise is effected by the uncertainties in the recorded production data. Flow measurement data and the outputs of the history matching (such as the modified reservoir model) are the elements employed in the process of optimisation. Any uncertainty in these elements can therefore deter the process from finding the optimum operating conditions and values for the controllable inputs of the reservoir and, as a result, decrease its ultimate economic recovery.   16  2.3.3 Well testing Well testing (or pressure transient testing) is another practice in the oil and gas industry that significantly contributes to reservoir management through providing information from the reservoir. It is an inverse problem (similar to history matching) through which some characteristics of a reservoir and its wells, such as the average permeability, drainage area, storativity, distance to faults, and the shape of the drainage area, are calculated. The fundamentals of different well testing techniques have been discussed by Stewart (2011), Chaudhry (2004), and Zhuang (2012).  The main parameters of a well measured during a well test and then analysed are pressure and flow rates. Pressure is normally measured both at the bottom of the wells (bottom-hole pressure or BHP) and at the surface (well head pressure or WHP). Flow rates, however, are typically measured using flow meters at the surface through standard flow measurement techniques common in the industry. Some of these techniques have been explained in Section 2.4. The most common technique is still using a test separator and single-phase flow meters. Since flow rate data plays a fundamental role in well testing analysis, any uncertainty in the data can also have a potentially significant effect on the analysis. It means these uncertainties can indirectly affect the reservoir management process and eventually reduce the economic recovery of oil and gas from the reservoir. Figure 2.2 illustrates the role of well testing in CLRM in developing the reservoir model. The potential effects of flow measurement errors in well testing on reservoir management and hydrocarbon economic recovery are discussed in Chapter 5.  2.4 Methods of flow measurement in the oil and gas industry Different flow measurement techniques and technologies are used to monitor up-stream production flow rates in the oil and gas industry. The flow measurement method for each field is chosen based on many factors, such as the required accuracy, production conditions (e.g. stability and water cut), number of owners, and the associated costs. In the following sections, some of these flow measurement methods and the related technologies are explained.  17  2.4.1 Flow meters Flow meters are widely used in the oil and gas industry and they are the basis of production monitoring systems in all oil and gas fields. Although virtual flow metering and allocation methods are explained in separate sections below, even those methods are not fully independent of actual flow meters. The application of flow meters, as a result, has a long history in the oil and gas industry and their measurements are still considered the most accurate production flow rate data in the industry (compared to other available methods). There are two general types of flow meters: single-phase flow meters and multi-phase flow meters (MPFM).  2.4.1.1 Single-phase flow meters Monitoring the flow rate of a multi-phase stream is a complicated practice. On the other hand, the technology for single-phase flow measurements has been available for a considerable time and is ubiquitous. Hence in the majority of oil and gas fields, the multi-phase flow production of wells is first separated into single-phase flow streams of oil, gas, and water, respectively and then each stream measured by single-phase flow meters. Although the application of multi-phase flow meters has recently increased, the measurements of single-phase flow meters are still considered more reliable when a high accuracy is needed, such as in fiscal measurement and custody transfer. The main types of single-phase flow meter which are currently used in the oil and gas industry are differential pressure, ultrasonic, Coriolis, vortex, thermal, positive displacement, and turbine. In the following sections, the first three mentioned types are explained briefly.  2.4.1.1.1 Differential pressure flow meters Flow meters that work based on a differential pressure mechanism have been available for more than a century and are still the most widely used flow meters in the industry (Liptak 1993). They include an element that reduces the cross section of the pipe available to the flow and therefore create a pressure difference that can be measured. This pressure difference measurement can subsequently provide the flow rate of the phase through the associated equations (Baker 2016). Some of the most common types of differential pressure flow meter are venture meters, orifice meters, and flow nozzles.  These flow meters are suitable for gas or 18  liquid. Their mechanism is simple and there is no limitation on the pipe size. They, however, cause a larger pressure drop compared to some other flow meters such as ultrasonic. Another disadvantage is that the fluid density is required in equations, that they cannot measure themselves. The fluid density, therefore, should be measured or estimated independent from the flow meter. It can potentially introduce extra measurement or estimation errors to the flow measurement data. They are also intrusive that means production needs to be stopped while they are installed.    2.4.1.1.2 Ultrasonic flowmeters The application of ultrasonic flow meters has recently increased in the oil and gas industry because of some advantages they have over other types of flow meter. They measure the time required for ultrasonic energy pulses to travel through the flowing fluid. The in-line (intrusive) type ultrasonic flow meters are accurate enough to be used in both gas and liquid custody transfers. They create less pressure drop compared to some other types of flow meter, such as differential pressure, and they can be produced in a non-intrusive design. Non-intrusive ultrasonic flow meters are typically referred to as the ‚Äòclamp-on‚Äô type. Although they have a lower accuracy than the in-line type, their installation does not need a process shut down (Liptak 2003).  2.4.1.1.3 Coriolis flow meters The technology of Coriolis flow meters is relatively new even compared to ultrasonic flow meters. Their main advantages that differentiate them from the other flow meters is that they directly measure mass flow rate (while other flow meters normally measure volumetric flow rate) and the density of the flowing fluid. These two parameters are measured based the principle of the Coriolis force which is produced in their oscillating systems (Padmanabhan 2012). The flow meter includes vibrating tubes which change their frequency and Coriolis force balance when a fluid flows through them. When the fluid enters the flow meter, it is divided between two tubes (a strait and a curved tube). These two tubes oscillate with different speeds and create sine waves with different frequencies. The time delay between the sine waves (that shows the relative speed of the tubes compared to each other) is directly proportional to the mass flow rate of the fluid. Although Coriolis flow meters have these inherent unique 19  advantages, they are more expensive and there are limitations on their operational flow range (Liptak 1993).  2.4.1.2 Multi-phase flow meters (MPFM) One of the challenges of the oil and gas industry is dealing with the complications of multi-phase streams. Although combining separators and single-phase flow meters enables operators to measure the flow rate of each phase, it is technically and financially not possible to have all these facilities for each production well. In some specific cases the available space is limited, such as on offshore production platforms, therefore placing even a single test separator is sometimes a challenge. In many oil and gas fields, the production of individual wells is therefore not measured or measured only occasionally through flow tests. Not only does this approach introduce large uncertainties to the available data, but it also increases the reaction time of operators to production flow rate changes because of the lack of real-time production data. Moreover, there is an increasing problem of ageing reservoirs meaning that there are more instabilities in their production caused by water or gas breakthrough. The need for a real time production monitoring system is therefore felt more than at any time in the past. As one response to this need, MPFMs were brought into use in the late 20th century. MPFMs can provide real-time measurements of two or three phase flows. Their technology has developed significantly since they were firstly introduced to the industry, leading to a higher measurement accuracy, lower prices, less health and safety problems, and a wider range of applicability. Some of the advantages of using MPFMs over traditional methods of flow measurement in the oil and gas industry are: ‚Ä¢ Providing real-time continuous data of production leading to less uncertainty and faster reactions by operators to production changes ‚Ä¢ Occupying less space; a factor which is important, especially in offshore fields ‚Ä¢ Enabling the operators to monitor flowrates remotely ‚Ä¢ Facilitating the monitoring of individual wells On the other hand, there are still some difficulties with the cost of MPFMs which can be up to hundreds of thousands of dollars that should be added to the cost of their regular calibration and maintenance. Categorising MPFM types is not as easy as single-phase flow meters since an MPFM includes different units which are responsible for the measurement of different 20  characteristics of the flow, such as phase densities, phase velocities, phase ratios, and total mass flow rate. Each flow meter, as a result, is a combination of different technologies
