CRPS is subdivided into two subgroups:Type 1 without distinct major nerve damage and Type 2 withevidence of a major nerve lesion.1 The clinical presentationincludes a widespread spectrum of manifestations includingsensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor, and trophic changes.2As a result of this clinical heterogeneity, the diagnosis is oftendelayed and solely based on clinical signs and symptoms(revised Budapest criteria).3 Since there is no underlying orcausal cure, the therapy remains symptom-based and includesa variety of pharmacological, interventional, and rehabilitativeoptions (such as psychology, physical therapy, and occupa-tional therapy). Although benign trajectories have beenreported, several prospective studies indicate an unfavorableprognosis with persistent symptoms after one year.4–6According to the definition introduced by the AmericanPsychological Association, resilience described as the processof adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy,threats or significant sources of stress.7 Resilience represents adynamic construct which may change over time as a functionof development and individual interaction with the environ-ment.8 Determinants of resilience include a host of biological,psychological, social, and cultural factors that interact withone another to determine how one responds to stressfulexperiences.9 Recently, the concept of resilience has receivedgrowing interest regarding its potential influence on health,Received: 6 February 2023.

An adequatedegree of resilience potentially helps patients with CRPS tocope with the challenging circumstances. To date, however,CRPS guidelines do not recommend measuring resilience inthe standard clinical practice. Hence, little is known about thetypical resilience status of patients with CRPS and the associa-tion with other clinical parameters which are obtained inpractice. Therefore, this cross-sectional study, enrollingpatients referred to one specialized CRPS center,1 assessed thedegree of patients’ resilience using standardized methods,2explored the relationship between the degree of resilience andpatient-related outcome measurements, and3 sought to iden-tify any pattern of clinical manifestations associated with lowresilience.MethodsSetting and participantsThis is a cross-sectional analysis of baseline information ofpatients participating in a single center study, was conductedbetween February 2019 and June 2021. The participants wereconsecutively recruited from the outpatient clinic of theDepartment of Physical Medicine & Rheumatology of theBalgrist University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. FB per-formed the screening visit with possible participants. In thecontext of the global COVID-19 pandemic, no regular consul-tations were held during the lockdown in Switzerlandbetween March 16, 2020, and April 26, 2020. Accordingly,we were not able to recruit participants during this period.Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.The data were obtained within the feasibility study of collect-ing data for CRPS clinical studies (COMPACT-Q) using acore measurement set.16 The set of CRPS related parameterswas selected based on the international recommendations ofCore Outcome Measures for complex regional PAin syn-drome Clinical Trials (COMPACT).16,17 We obtained permis-sion from the distributors or license holders, whereapplicable, to use the standardized questionnaires in the rele-vant languages for the purposes of the COMPACT-Q feasibil-ity study.The study was approved by the Ethics Committee ofZurich (BASEC: 2019–00619).All participants were adults (age  18) who met the diag-nostic criteria for CRPS 1 of the hand or the foot according tothe revised Budapest criteria.18 Excluded were patients notproficient in the German language and patients with any men-tal health condition which may detrimentally impede studyparticipation.Assessment of resilienceConnor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC)The degree of resilience was assessed by the CD-RISC19 (per-mission of the authors was obtained). The scale consists of 25items, which are evaluated on a 5-point Likert scale rangingfrom 0 to 4: not true at all (0), rarely true,1 sometimes true,2often true,3 and true nearly all of the time.4 The sum scoreresults in a number between 0–100, and higher scores indicatehigher resilience. In the framework of the validation study,reference scores for the following groups were calculated: acommunity sample (n¼577), primary care outpatients(n¼139), general psychiatric outpatients (n¼ 43), a clinicaltrial of generalized anxiety disorders (n¼ 25), and two clinicaltrials of post-traumatic stress disorder (n¼ 22 in both tri-als).19 Further details of the reference groups were notdescribed in the publication.Clinical parameters of CRPSCRPS Severity Score (CSS)Disease activity was recorded by using the CRPS SeverityScore (CSS), which was directly derived from the BudapestCRPS diagnostic criteria.20 The CSS is completed by a clini-cian or an experienced healthcare professional by scoring thepresence or absence (coded 1/0) of 8 signs and 8 symptoms.Higher scores indicate greater CRPS severity (range 0–16).PROMIS-29The Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement InformationSystem 29-item Health Profile (PROMIS-29) is a genericpatient reported outcome measure to be used with the generalpopulation and with individuals living with chronic condi-tions.21 Promis-29 provides measures of health status thatassess physical, mental, and social well–being. The question-naire includes 28 items from seven domains (depression, anxi-ety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleepdisturbance, and ability to participate in social roles and activ-ities) and a single item on pain intensity. According to currentrecommendations,17 a suicidal ideation was assessed using asingle PROMIS item22 in this study. Each item has fiveresponse options (values 1 to 5), except for the pain intensityitem which has eleven response options (values 0 to 10).PROMIS measures generate T-scores with a mean of 50 andstandard deviation of 10 in a reference population. Based onlarge scale calibration testing the T-scores are interpretedwithin normal limits, mild, moderate, severe.23Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 (SF-MPQ-2)According to the previously stated recommendations, neuro-pathic pain qualities were captured using the six neuropathicitems from the SF-MPQ-2.24 Each item was rated based on a0–10 scale with 0 equal to no pain and 10 equals to the worstpain ever during the past week. The total score is calculatedby summing the individual scores. Higher scores indicatemore neuropathic pain (range 0–60).Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) is a 13-item self-reportmeasure designed to assess catastrophic thinking related topain among adults.25 People are asked to indicate the degreeto which they have the above thoughts and feelings when theyare experiencing pain using the 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time)scale. A total score is calculated (ranging from 0 to 52).Higher scores indicate more pain catastrophizing. Scores <30indicate a not problematic thinking and 30 represent prob-lematic levels of catastrophic thinking.25Pain Medicine, 2023, Vol. 24, No. 9 1067EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level instrument (EQ-5D-5L)The EQ-5D-5L is a generic health-related quality of life meas-ure.26 It consists of two pages: the descriptive system and theVisual Analogue Scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5 L descriptivesystem consists of five dimensions as follows: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.Each dimension in the EQ-5D-5L has five response levels: noproblems (Level 1); slight; moderate; severe; and extremeproblems (Level 5). A total of 3125 health states are definedfor EQ-5D-5 L. Health states are from 1–1-1–1-1 (the besthealth state) to 5–5-5–5-5 (the worst health state). EQ-5D-5 Lhealth states are converted into a single index “utility” scoreusing a scoring algorithm. The instrument also includes a vis-ual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) which provides a single globalrating of self-perceived health and is scored on a 0 to 100mmscale representing “the worst . . .” and “the best health youcan imagine”, respectively.Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ)The PSEQ is a 10-item questionnaire developed to assess theconfidence people with ongoing pain have in performingactivities while in pain.27 The respondent considers how con-fident they are performing each activity, while taking theirpain into account (0 not at all confident to 6 completely confi-dent). A total score is calculated (ranging from 0 to 60) wherehigher scores indicate more confidence.Statistical analysisWe summarized continuous variables with means, standarddeviations and T-scores. Dichotomous variables were sum-marized with percentages. Prior to do regression analyses, weassessed whether the data violated the formal requirementsusing appropriate methods. Using univariate analyses, weinvestigated the relationship between the CSS, the sevendomains of the PROMIS-29, SF-MPQ-2, PCS, EQ-5D-5L,PSEQ (independent variables), and the extent of resiliencemeasured with the CD-RISC (dependent variable). Based onthis univariate assessment, we selected those domains show-ing statistically significant association with the outcome. Inexploratory analyses using multivariate regression models, weinvestigated the relationship between the PCS and the sum ofthe significant PROMIS-29 domains and the CD-RISC. Usingtwo thresholds from the literature for CD-RISC values, weclassified groups of healthy subjects, primary care patientsand generalized anxiety patients.19 For these three groups, weplotted the fitted corresponding PROMIS-29 sum valuesalong with the 95% confidence interval. In another explora-tory analysis, we assessed whether patients fully able to workhad different CSS and resilience scores than those not able towork using a logistic regression model. P values <.05 wereconsidered as statistically significant. Statistical analyses wereperformed using Stata, Version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, CollegeStation, Texas, USA). Study data were stored and managedwith REDCap versions 6.12.1 to 6.14.1 (REDCap,Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA).ResultsCharacteristics of the study populationWe screened 79 patients with CRPS for our cross-sectionalstudy, wherein five patients decided not to participate withoutgiving further reasons. Therefore, 74 participants wererecruited for this study. Three patients did not fill out thequestionnaires, and ultimately 71 patients were enrolled inthis study.The majority of the participants were females (90.1%), andthe mean age was 51.26 12.9 years. The hand was affectedalmost twice as often as the foot and fractures represented themost common initiating event. The median duration of symp-toms was 106 26.6months. More than half of the partici-pants were not able to work due to their CRPS. The mean ofthe CD-RISC score was 70.96 14.0. Compared to the refer-ence scores reported in the validation study of the CD-RISC,this score was lower than in the US general population(80.46 12.8) and among primary care patients (71.86 18.4)and higher than patients with generalized anxiety disorders(62.46 10.7).19 It should be noted that a low score on theCD-RISC suggests lower levels of resilience. The results of thePROMIS-29 questionnaire indicated mild (domains depres-sion, fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain interference) to moderatesymptoms (anxiety), a moderate impairment of physical func-tion and no restriction in social participation.28 The charac-teristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1and the results of the self-reported outcome variables aredepicted in Table 2.Univariate analysesThere was no association between CRPS severity and the levelof resilience (-0.03 (95%CI: -0.09 to 0.03); P¼ 0.344)(Figure 1). Quality of Life as measured with the EQ-5D-5Lwas positively correlated with resilience (0.005 (95% CI:0.001 to 0.009); P¼ .006), as was pain self-efficacy as meas-ured with the PSEQ (0.35 (95% CI: 0.10 to 0.61); P¼ 007).The level of catastrophizing as measured with the PCS wasinversely correlated with the level of resilience (0.45 (95%CI: 0.63 to 0.26; P< .001). For the PROMIS-29 thedomains of anxiety (0.29 (95% CI: 0.44 to 0.15):P< .001), depression (0.27 (95% CI: 0.40 to 0.15);P< .001) and fatigue (0.39 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.21);P< .001) were inversely correlated with the level of resilience.The domains of physical function, sleep disturbance, painTable 1.

Second, based on the reference scoresfrom the validation study, we categorized the degree of resil-ience into three categories: (CD-RISC 80) corresponding tothe US general population, intermediate resilience, (CD-RISC>60, <80) corresponding to primary care patients, and lowdegree resilience (CD-RISC  60) found in patients with gen-eralized anxiety.19 In a logistic regression analysis, the pro-portion of patients with low degree of resilience increasedwith higher levels of anxiety, depression, and fatigue (oddsratio 2.65 (95% CI: 0.96 to 7.33); P¼ .061) with a lowgoodness-of-fit (Pseudo R2¼5.2%) and without reaching stat-istical significance (Figure 2). Finally, we did not find a consis-tent pattern of CSS and CD-RISC scores between patientsfully able to work and those unable to work.DiscussionMain findingsThe aim of this cross-sectional cohort study was to assess thedegree of resilience in patients with CRPS 1, to explore therelationship between resilience and patient-related outcomemeasurements and to describe a pattern of clinical manifesta-tions associated with low resilience. We found an associationbetween quality-of-life pain, efficacy, and in selected domainsof general health including anxiety, depression and fatigue,and the level of resilience. Interestingly, disease severity wasnot associated with the degree of resilience, indicating that thetwo concepts are not related. This indicates that, independentfrom disease activity, patients with CRPS with a high degreeof anxiety, depression and fatigue should be screened for lowresilience. Furthermore, we found no association between thelevel of resilience and severity of CRPS. This finding suggeststhat the severity of CRPS may be predominantly influencedby biological factors. This is an important considerationwhen developing treatment approaches for CRPS, as it under-scores the need for interventions that address the underlyingbiological mechanisms of the condition.Results in the light of the existing literatureResilience can be conceptualized when one is in pain as beingable to recover from disability and depression, and sustainingfunctioning involving the ability to adapt to adversity.29Resilience is not the only factor that influences copingresponse. Other factors include pain episode itself and vulner-ability mechanisms (eg, catastrophizing, negative affect, ornegative social interactions).30 Resilience is a dynamic processencompassing positive adaptation in the face of adverse expe-riences that would otherwise lead to poor outcomes.31–33Resilience may not always result in recovery from disabilitybut may also influence adjustment to disability that foster sus-tained participation not only from their health impairmentbut also related to societal restrictions. A recent study pro-posed that resilience may be an important extension of thefear avoidance model.34 In the fear avoidance model, individ-ual responses to pain—in particular pain catastrophizing—may lead to pain-related fear and avoidance.35,36 Over time,avoidance of potential painful movement result in disuse, dis-ability, and depression, and ultimately a vicious cycle ofongoing pain. Resilience may mitigate catastrophizing andthus be associated with more active coping style.To date, resilience as a potential resource in CRPS 1patients has received little attention. In the only article on thistopic so far, Bodde et al.37 assessed the relationship betweenresilience and outcome after amputation in 26 patients withCRPS 1 and compared the results with reference groups fromthe literature respectively a control group from their outpa-tient rehabilitation clinic. The mean CD-RISC score of73.36 11.7 was slightly higher than in our study (mean70.96 14.0). The results showed that patients after amputa-tion because of CRPS 1 who have a higher resilience also havea higher quality of life and experience lower psychologicaldistress. The authors concluded that resilience should be fur-ther explored in Rehabilitation Medicine research in generalbecause it potentially represents an additional treatmentoption in rehabilitation care.A current review summarizing the role of resilience inorthopedic patients, concluded that resilience may contributeto favorable mental health and physical function. The authorsrecommended clinicians incorporating the resilience assess-ment into clinical practice, to identify patients at risk for anunfavorable postoperative outcome.38Strengths and limitationsTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assessresilience in a general CRPS 1 population. The strength of thisstudy includes a well characterized cohort of CRPS 1 patientsaccording to current international recommendations.17The limitations of this study are fourfold. First, the rela-tively small sample size and the recruitment from a single cen-ter may have affected the results. However, the demographicand clinical characteristics of our study population are in linewith the results of lager epidemiologic studies. Second, theTable 2.

Hence, alongitudinal study is needed to explore causality and the tem-poral sequencing of these findings. Third, it is unclear whetherresilience can be influenced and thus, outcomes improved.Finally, the study was conducted before and during the globalCOVID-19 pandemic. This potentially have influencedresilience in some patients. The COVID-19 pandemic inSwitzerland occurred in early February 2021 and the singlelockdown lasted from March 16, 2021, to April 26, 2021.Since we included most participants before February 2021(n¼53, 75%) and less than 10% (n¼ 7) were added after thelockdown, we do not expect the results were substantiallyinfluenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.Implication for practiceCoping strategies in patients with CRPS 1 may be importantfactors to consider. As disease severity seems to be unassoci-ated with the degree of resilience, the assessment for low resil-ience in CRPS 1 patients should be targeted at those patientsFigure 1. Association between the level of resilience and disease activity. CD-Risc ¼ Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale; CSS ¼ CRPS Severity ScoreFigure 2. Association between the sum of Promis-29 scores and the level of resilience. The plot shows the regression line and the corresponding 95%confidence band. The blue lines specify cut-off values of CD-RISC for different groups of subjects according to the validation study of Connor et al.191070 Pain Medicine, 2023, Vol. 24, No. 9with a high degree of anxiety, depression, and fatigue ratherthan those with better quality of life or pain self-efficacy. Weare unaware of a study showing the benefit of resilience train-ing and positive clinical outcomes in CRPS 1. A meta-analysison the efficacy of interventions to improve resilience foundonly weak evidence.11 Some single studies showed that spe-cific interventions to improve resilience in patients undergoinghip fracture surgery and patients with diabetes have positiveeffects.39,40Implication for researchIn our view two streams of research are needed. First, we needto increase our understanding regarding the dynamics of resil-ience in the clinical course of CRPS 1. This requires prospec-tively collected data for an extended period and severaltimepoints of re-assessment of health status, disease severityand resilience. Second, we need to understand if interventionstargeted at increasing resilience have a positive effect on thecourse of CRPS 1 and to what extent specific subgroups gaingreater benefits over others. Ideally, this would be assessed inrandomized trials comparing a group receiving specific resil-ience training with a group receiving standard care alone.ConclusionResilience seems to be an independent factor in CRPS 1 and isassociated with relevant parameters of the condition.Therefore, caretakers may screen the current resilience statusof CRPS 1 patients to offer a supplementary treatmentapproach. Whether specific resilience training modifies CRPS1 course, requires further investigations.FundingNo funding was received for this study.Conflicts of interest: The authors declare that they have noconflicts of interests.References1.
