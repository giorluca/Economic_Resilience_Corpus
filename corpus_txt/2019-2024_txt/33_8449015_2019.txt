Long-term climate adaptation in these regions has receivedincreasing attention, with recent initiatives aiming to increase resilience to climate change attimescales of years to decades. Less focus has been given toweather and short-term climateinformation.However, users are principally interested in shorter timescales (hours to seasons)whereactions can immediately reduce the impacts of severe weather events. Focusing on the priority sectorsof agriculture and food security, water and disastermanagement, this paper uses a systematic literaturereview approach to analyse 61 empirical case studies drawn from academic literature and projectsacross SSA.We identify themain users of climate services and outline current practices and reportedbenefits. Barriers that impede the delivery and uptake of climate services are identified and potentialstrategies for overcoming themoutlined based on the reporting of successful practices. Ourfindingsshow that greater capacity building of personnel working forNationalMeteorological andHydrological Services andAgricultural Extension staff and reinforcing and sustaining collaborationbetween different stakeholders (climate scientists, hydrologists, extensionworkers, farmers and otheruser groups), are essential factors for improving the uptake and utility of weather and climate servicesto enhance resilience to climate shocks in SSA.1. IntroductionSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces increasing risks fromclimate variability and change. These risks include waterstress, coastal inundation, changes in river hydrology andextreme weather events (Niang et al 2014). It is thereforeessential to better integrate weather and climate scienceinto societal-decision-making processes to support cli-mate adaptation and build resilience to climate shocks(Jones et al 2016). Of particular importance is weatherand short-term climate information at timescales ofhours, days, weeks, months and seasons, which areparticularly critical for decision-making in disastermanagement, agriculture and food security, energy andwater resources management (Tall et al 2012, Boyd et al2013,Roudier et al2014).Weather and climate services (WCS) involve thetimely production, translation, and delivery of usefulweather and short-term climate information, which isfit-for-purpose and produced in formats that can beintegrated into societal decision-processes (Vaughanet al 2016). Considerations critical to the delivery ofOPEN ACCESSRECEIVED30November 2018REVISED14October 2019ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION15October 2019PUBLISHED19November 2019Original content from thisworkmay be used underthe terms of the CreativeCommonsAttribution 3.0licence.Any further distribution ofthis workmustmaintainattribution to theauthor(s) and the title ofthework, journal citationandDOI.© 2019TheAuthor(s). Published by IOPPublishing LtdWCS include the nature of the risks being managed,region, sector, governance structure and context spe-cific (Adger et al 2009, Goddard et al 2010). The devel-opment of WCS has been facilitated by technologicaldevelopment for observing, mapping, modelling, pre-dicting atmospheric events and telecommunication(Deconinck et al 2017). This rapid advancement intechnology creates new possibilities to integrate WCSinto short-term decision-making (Boyd et al 2013).However, the use of climate information and knowl-edge is still limited and the most vulnerable in societyare not benefitting from the recent scientific and tech-nological advancements inWCS (Allis et al 2019).To meet the demand for improved climate ser-vices, theWorldMeteorological Organisation (WMO)launched the Global Framework for Climate Services(GFCS) in 2012. The GFCS has a mandate to provideand facilitate access to WCS to users with differentrequirements through observations and monitoring;research, modelling, and prediction; capacity build-ing; and the creation of user interface platforms(Hewitt et al 2012). Despite these efforts, users ofWCSoften raise concerns that forecasts are difficult tounderstand because of inconsistent use of terminologyby different WCS providers (Brasseur and Gallardo2016, Vaughan et al 2018). In this paper, climate ser-vice users are defined as policymakers, managers,engineers, researchers, students, farmers and the gen-eral public that use weather and short-term climateinformation and knowledge to inform decision mak-ing. Climate service providers are the public or privateinstitutions that supply weather and short-term cli-mate information and knowledge.The need for reliable, timelyWCS to enhance resi-lience to climate shock in SSA has been highlightedpreviously (e.g. Boyd et al 2013, Jubach andTokar 2016). However, the WCS landscape in SSAremains poorly understood partly due to the lack ofsystematic assessments of users’ needs for WCS espe-cially forecast timescales and lead times. There are alsovery few evaluations of how the provision of WCS hasbenefitted end users in SSA.To address these research gaps, this paper addres-ses the following research questions using a systematicliterature review of existing evidence: (i)What are theforecast timescales that are most relevant to users ofWCS in SSA? (ii) To what extent do users of WCS inSSA derive benefits from using WCS products? and(iii) What are the barriers impeding the successfuldelivery and uptake ofWCS in SSA.We aim to provide evidence to enhance the deliv-ery of WCS and to facilitate the development of pro-ducts that better address the users’ needs. Consideringthat WCS have potential applications in many sectors;we limit our scope to three climate sensitive sectors;agriculture and food security, disaster management,and water resources management and hydropower.These sectors have been identified as key for WCSdevelopment due to their climate sensitivity (Vaughanand Dessai 2014, Vaughan et al 2016) and are priorityareaswithin theGFCS.The target regions for this review are East andWestAfrica. These regions were selected as being repre-sentative of the different agro-ecological zones foundacross in SSA (Seo 2014). Moreover, they exhibitdynamic climates controlled by deep mesoscale con-vective systems and other complex atmospheric pro-cesses which makes it challenging to provide accurateforecasts (Cornforth 2012). The current generation offorecast models such as UK Met Office operationalseasonal forecasting system (GloSea5), Meteo-Franceseasonal forecasting system 5 and the European Cen-tre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)seasonal forecasts System 4 are all reported to showvery good representation of weather and short-termclimate forecasts over these regions (Vellinga et al2013, Batté et al 2018, Tucker et al 2018, Gbangou et al2019). The availability of these forecasting modelsoffer new opportunities to enhance the delivery ofWCS in these regions.2.MethodologyThis paper adopts a systematic literature reviewapproach. This review approach is used here because itallows existing knowledge and evidence from indivi-dual case studies to be summarised under commonthemes (Ford and Pearce 2010, Ford et al 2010).Through thismethod, it is possible to identify gaps andprovide recommendations for new research directionsand best practice based on evidence from across arange of case studies (Portia Adade et al 2018). Thesystematic literature review adopted here follows theapproach proposed by Butler et al (2016) that seeks tominimise bias and enhance transparency. A similarapproach has been used in other climate servicesreviews by Vaughan and Dessai (2014). The reviewtargeted English language peer-reviewed and non-peerreview (grey) literature published from January 2010to June 2019 (to correspond with the launch of GFCS).Moreover we targeted only empirical case studieshighlighting how users of WCS used forecasts forweather and short-term climate information to makeshort-term decisions. To maximise the number ofrelevant articles/reports captured, two academic data-bases were searched: Web of Science and GoogleScholar.We used the search terms shown in table 1 andsearches based on the specific country names andregions; Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, East Africa,West Africa. Papers were included in the study if theyincluded evidence addressing one of the following:(1) The forecast timescales solicited by users(2) The nature ofWCS provided to users2Environ. Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et al(3) The kind of decisions made by users and benefitsderived(4) Barriers to the uptake and adoption of WCSin SSAThe number of articles/reports reviewed andincluded in the systematic literature review are shownin table 1. In total 61 articles/reports were included inthe review of which 8 were non-peer reviewed or greyliterature. Some studies covered more than one sectorand also highlighted some barriers to the uptake andadoption of WCS in SSA. Few examples from neigh-bouring countries were included to highlight the bene-fits of using specificWCS products.As with any systematic literature review ours hasits limits. While our focus on the key areas of agri-culture and food security, disaster management andwater resources is justified by their climate sensitivity(Vaughan and Dessai 2014, Vaughan et al 2016) andtheir status as priority areas within the GFCS, weacknowledge that these are not the only sectors of cri-tical importance for WCS development in Africa. Thehealth sector, for instance, represents an importantpotential user of WCS at weather and short-term cli-mate timescales, in terms of both direct impacts (e.g.heatwave hazards) and predicting potential diseaseoutbreaks at seasonal to sub-seasonal timescales.Nonetheless, this focussed approach allows us to iden-tify key uses ofWCS and barriers to their uptake acrossa representative range of climate zones in SSA.3. ResultsStudies from Kenya and Senegal accounted for over50%of those reviewed, while fewer than 2%were fromNigeria despite the country’s size and population. InWest Africa, more than 75% of studies were fromSenegal (figure 1(a)). One possible reason why Senegalhas been the focus of more studies relates to theinternational attention and media coverage elicited byhistoric climate and weather related disasters in theSahel region, including droughts in the 1970s and1980s and flooding in the 2000s (Tschakert et al 2010,Engel et al 2017). Our literature search also showedthat studies of users’ needs for climate services aremore numerous for the agriculture and food securitysector than the other focal sectors, with more than50% of studies satisfying the inclusion criteria for thisreview focusing on agriculture or food security(figure 1(b)). This can be attributed to the importancethat donors and funding organisations attach toagriculture and food security in SSA. In East Africa, themajority of the studies relevant to disaster manage-ment focused on Lake Victoria due to the high numberof weather related deaths on the lake.Appendix provides a comprehensive overview ofempirical studies included in the review.3.1. Agriculture and food securityAcross the studies we reviewed, arable farmers identi-fied a range of forecast information and timescalesrelevant to their farming activities. A summary ofclimate services and benefits identified in the agricul-ture and food security sector is shown in Table 2.These include; daily weather forecasts, daily forecastson extreme rainfall events, false rainfall alerts, rainfallbreaks, 10 d forecasts for rainfall; droughts; and soilmoisture content, seasonal forecasts for rainfall anddroughts, rainfall onset for expected sowing dates,rainfall cessation dates,monsoon onset dates, forecastson temperature, and the spatial distribution of dailyand 10 d forecasts for rainfall (Onyango et al 2014,Roudier et al 2014, 2016, Amegnaglo et al 2017,Tarchiani et al 2017, Ouedraogo et al 2018, Gbangouet al 2019, Nyadzi et al 2019). Policymakers weremoreinterested inWCS that used a combination of seasonalforecasts and crop models to predict crop yield atregional scale using impact based models (Wetterhallet al 2015).For pastoralists, key forecast information andtimescales included; seasonal forecasts on the avail-ability of pasture, seasonal forecasts for water resour-ces availability, forecast for the onset date of rains,daily forecast for extreme rainfall events, and spatialdistribution of rainfall during the rainy season, dryspells, the end date of the rainy season, daily potentiallightning zones during the rainy season which pastor-alists highlighted as the principal cause of animal loss,10 d rainfall forecast (Rasmussen et al 2014, Oue-draogo et al 2018).Table 1.

Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et alThe decisions made by arable farmers varieddepending on the time-scale of the forecasts. Theyused seasonal forecasts to make strategic decisions onseed variety, geographic distribution of plots, landmanagement techniques, management of pest anddisease outbreak through the timely purchase of pesti-cides and fungicides; daily to 10 d forecasts were usedto adjust sowing dates, and plan for cropping opera-tions such as land preparation, application of fertiliser,weeding, plan early harvest and post-harvest opera-tions, (Onyango et al 2014, Roudier et al 2014, Knivetonet al 2015, Tarchiani et al 2017, Mckune et al 2018).The availability of community-managed rain gaugesalso enhanced farmers’ decisions as it helped them todetermine if the rainfall threshold was exceeded so asto adjust cropping operations (Kniveton et al 2015,Tarchiani et al 2017).The benefits derived by farmers after using climateservices for their farming decisions were similar in thestudied regions. Results from a study across four WestAfrican countries including Ghana indicated that theuse of WCS by farmers helped to increase maize yieldsby an average of 44% (Tarchiani et al 2017). A separatestudy in Burkina Faso reported that the use of forecastsby farmers induced changes in farming practicesamong 75% of the target farmers; leading to a 30%increase in grain production and substantially reducedpost-harvest losses (Roudier et al 2014). Results fromthe same study also indicated that 10 d forecasts weremore useful to farmers than seasonal forecasts. Theseresults were supported by a similar study in Niger(Roudier et al 2016). A survey of 289 farmers in Sene-gal found that: 78% used WCS to guide their farmingdecisions at the onset of the rainy season, 96% expres-sed satisfaction with the farming decisions taken afterreceiving WCS and 78% reported of a substantialincrease in crop yield (Ouedraogo et al 2018). InBenin, 95% of 354 maize farmers involved in anassessment of the economic benefits of WCS, indi-cated that they changed their farming decisions afterreceiving WCS. Results from a study covering bothSenegal and Kenya showed that more than two-thirdof the farmers who participated in the study attributedthe increase in crop yield to their ability to changefarming decisions based on the accessibility to and useof WCS (Kniveton et al 2015). Likewise, in Ghana,Kenya and Senegal farmers reported a substantialincrease in crop yield after using climate services(Onyango et al 2014, Anuga and Gordon 2016,Mckune et al 2018).The benefits of forecasts for pastoralists were alsowidely varied. In Burkina Faso, the 10 d forecast is par-ticularly useful for making decisions on which trans-humance corridors to use, purchase of supplementaryfodder and to identify potential diseases occurrencezones (Rasmussen et al 2014, Ouedraogo et al 2018). Aseparate study in the West African Sahel, indicatedthat access to weather and short-term climate infor-mation contributed substantially in preventing farmer—pastoralist conflicts by guiding the mobility of pas-toralists (Mertz et al 2016).The channels through which WCS are receivedhave been found to be broadly consistent across differ-ent farmer groups. Separate studies focusing on differ-ent farming communities indicate that the followinghave a positive impact on farming decisions: transla-tion ofWCS into local languages; transmission of fore-cast information through mobile phones; increasingthe frequency of sharing forecast information; broad-casting of forecasts through local radio stations; andscheduling of special broadcast times for farmers(Onyango et al 2014, Anuga and Gordon 2016, Jostet al 2016, Amegnaglo et al 2017, Tarchiani et al 2017,Mckune et al 2018, Ouedraogo et al 2018). Where lit-eracy is limited butmobile phones are accessible, voicemessages in local languages are also be valuable, asindicated by the work with pastoralist communities inBurkina Faso (Rasmussen et al 2015). At communitylevel, informal networks such as farmers groups, localvillage elders and agricultural extension workers canalso play an important role in disseminating forecastinformation (Amegnaglo et al 2017). Where forecastsare not regularly disseminated through easily acces-sible channels, farmers may rely solely on traditionalforecast methods, as evidenced by findings fromGhana (Jost et al 2016).With respect to stated preferences for receivingforecasts, results from multiple studies suggest that alarge proportion of farmers strongly favour radiobroadcasts (Onyango et al 2014, Mckune et al 2018).Some have also expressed a preference for forecasts tobe accompanied by agricultural information aboutnew seed varieties, new farming practices and adviseon livestockmanagement (Mckune et al 2018).Taken together, ourfindings suggest that the use ofWCS in the agriculture sector is gainingmomentum inthe target regions with direct evidence of benefitsbeing realised in terms of increased yields. However,they also highlight the critical importance of forecastinformation being provided in a way that is accessibleto farming communities, with key requirements beingthe availability in local languages, the provision of ver-bal communications for those who cannot read, andensuring that forecasts are disseminated to commu-nities in a consistent and timely manner linked to spe-cific actions and agricultural extension advice.3.2.DisastermanagementTo adequately manage an increasing number ofclimate related disasters, save lives and manageresources more efficiently, there is an increasing pushfor disaster management authorities to shift fromfocusing primarily on crisis response, tomaking use ofearly warning systems to prepare for high impactevents (Braman et al 2013, Tall et al 2013, Wilkinsonet al 2018). In climate sensitive regions such as SSA, thepotential use of early warning information to directly5Environ. Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et alaid vulnerable communities in better coping withclimate hazards, saving lives and preserving liveli-hoods has been widely acknowledged (e.g. Tall et al2012). A summary of climate services and benefits inthe disastermanagement sector is shown inTable 3.At seasonal timescales, recent advances mean thatscientific capacity to predict potential severe events isimproving. In a study covering the whole SSA,ECMWF seasonal rainfall forecasts were used to drivethe Global Flood Awareness System with results indi-cating that ECMWF seasonal forecasts are reliable foridentifying the drivers of seasonal flooding and couldbe used for flood preparedness in the semi-aridregions of Africa (De Perez et al 2017). In a separatestudy in West Africa, it was demonstrated thatECMWF seasonal to sub-seasonal forecasts (ECMWF-S2S) were skillful in predicting rainfall anomalies inthe semi-arid Sahel and are useful for monitoringdroughts (Olaniyan et al 2018). A similar study in EastAfrica showed that forecasts from ECMWF analysedusing Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) could beused to predict the spatial extent and intensity ofdroughts (Mwangi et al 2014).Within the disaster management sector, there isincreasing evidence of the uptake of seasonal forecastinformation for disaster planning and preparedness.In West Africa, the International Federation for RedCross and Red Crescent (IFRC) have used seasonalforecasts to implement an early warning and earlyaction strategy to enhance flood preparedness andresponse (Braman et al 2013). In Niger, seasonal fore-casts obtained from tropical applications of meteorol-ogy using satellite (TAMSAT) have been combinedwith Rainwatch (http://walker.ac.uk/rw/) real timemonitoring (Maidment et al 2017) to monitor mon-soon rainfall in Niger. Rainwatch places a currentSahel monsoon in the context of other seasons andoutputs information of the monsoon evolution incomparison with key historical information (Boydet al 2013). In East Africa, humanitarian agencies alsocombined seasonal forecasts with analogue data frompast El Niño events to develop contingency plans toimplement response activities for emergency reliefoperations (De La Poterie et al 2018). In Senegaldisastermanagement teams use forecasts tomake stra-tegic decisions such as pre-positioning flood reliefitems, training local personnel to improve disasterresponse time, developing flood contingency plans,and launching pre-emergency funding requests fromthe international community (Hamer et al 2017).Notably, a national flood management committee hasbeen established and with forecasts becoming moreimpact-based, different flood preparation andresponse strategies can be triggered bymembers of thiscommittee (Hamer et al 2017).At shorter (0–6 h) timescales, timely and action-able forecasts are also critical to limiting the harmcaused by severe weather events. This need is illu-strated by a recent study investigating the use of WCSto enhance navigation safety in Lake Victoria, whichshows that storms, strong winds and strong waveswere responsible for 13%–29% of annual reportedaccidents on the Lake (Kiwanuka-Tondo et al 2019).To reduce the number of casualties fromweather rela-ted events, the Lake Victoria Intense storm EarlyWarning System (VIEWS) has been developed to fore-cast hazardous thunderstorms over the lake at night(Thiery et al 2017). For the information emergingfrom these systems to be successfully used at commu-nity level, it is critical to ensure that they meet theneeds of the users. Gender should be taken intoaccount when considering the accessibility and dis-semination of forecast information. In Ghana, forinstance, it has been recommended that womenshould be given greater involvement in disaster man-agement operations at local level, due to their leadingrole in organisational networks, which can facilitateboth the dissemination of information and sub-sequent response (Caruson et al 2014).The evidence reviewed here evidences both grow-ing scientific capacity to forecast severe events in SSAat weather to short-term climate timescales, and grow-ing uptake by disaster management organisations. Forthe potential benefits ofWCS for disastermanagementin SSA to be fully realised, further work is essential toensure that early warning systems developed to sup-port community resilience are tailored to meet theneeds of the diverse range of potential users.Table 3.

Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et alIn summary, the main WCS identified in the dis-aster management sector include: seasonal, monthly,7 d, 5 d and 0–6 h forecasts and combining forecastswith other tools to gain relevant information on theprecursors of a disaster, its extent and intensity.3.3.Water resourcesmanagement and hydropowerWithin the water resources management and hydro-power sector WCS are used to make both tacticaldecisions at seasonal timescale (3–9 months) andoperational decisions at short-term (daily, weekly tomonthly forecast). These uses may include operatingrules for system control schemes, dam releases tomeetdownstream users’ needs, and environmental require-ments (Ziervogel et al 2010). A summary of climateservices and benefits identified in the water resourcessector is shown inTable 4.In East Africa, seasonal forecasts with lead times ofone season have been useful in guiding the storage andrelease decision for hydropower dams; therebyincreasing energy output, reducing energy losses andimproving reliability (Dinku et al 2014). There is a vitalneed to incorporate forecasts information into a rain-fall-runoff model to produce streamflow forecastscoupled with a hydropower management model toassess whether forecasts add value. Using the sameapproach, seasonal forecasts can also be used to man-age reservoirs for urban water supply and irrigationwatermanagement (e.g. Stewart 2011).In Kenya, the Turkuna County Water ResourcesManagement Authority and National Drought Man-agement Authority (NDMA) use forecasts fromKenyaMeteorological Department (KMD) to run opera-tional models which enable them to make strategicwater management decisions (Haines et al 2017). Thedifferent water resource management authorities haveindicated their trust in the forecasts provided by theKMD because of its base as a government institutionwhich they felt cannot provide unverified forecasts toother government institutions (Haines et al 2017).Tailored platforms have been identified as ameansto integrate forecasts into water resource decision-making in West Africa also. The open-source ‘waterobservation and information system’ (WOIS) wasdeveloped under the Tiger-Net project for trans-basinmanagement of water resources, hydrological model-ling and flood forecasting using remote sensing data inAfrica (Guzinski et al 2014). In Niger, the open-source‘Outil de Prédiction des Inondations dans leDeltaIn-térieur duNiger’ (OPIDIN) platformwas developed topredict water levels, the timing of flood peaks, andmaximal flood extent for the Inner Niger Delta (Coolset al 2016). The potential for such platforms is high-lighted byWetterhall et al (2015), who found that one-month forecasts from a global climate model used topredict end-of-season maize yield and accumulatedstreamflow showed high potential for a commodity-orientated forecast system for application in assessingagricultural impacts and actions.Although the water resources and hydropowersector are less well represented amongst the papersidentified in this review, the available evidence doessuggest high potential for further integration of WCSwith hydrologicalmodels.The key WCS identified in the water managementsector include: seasonal forecasts with lead times ofone season, monthly, 7 and 5 d forecasts which areused to run operational models, development of opensource software to enhance water management atbasin scale, combining rainfall-runoff model(s) andseasonal forecast to predict regional water yield.3.4. Barriers to the delivery anduptake ofWCSThe production and delivery of WCS does notguarantee that the information will be used or is evenuseful for decision-making. In the studies reviewed,common barriers to the uptake and use ofWCS in SSAhave been identified.Table 4.

Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et al3.4.1. Awareness, understanding and accessibilityThe comparatively low uptake ofWCS in SSA has beenattributed to many factors including; awareness ofWCS, accessibility of WCS, poor communication offorecasts, inappropriate use of language, illiteracy andculture (Ochieng et al 2017). Firstly, users must beaware that relevant WCS exist in order to utilise them.Potential users cannot realise benefits from servicesthat they are unware of. For example results from astudy investigating climate risk communication fornavigation safety in the Lake Victoria reported thatmore than 70% of the stakeholders interviewed (fish-ermen, fish traders, fish transporters, boat owners/commercial ship operators) were not aware thatweather information was available for navigationsafety (Kiwanuka-Tondo et al 2019).Where potential users are aware of the existence ofWCS, poor understanding of forecasts because thecontent and format are too technical and not clearlyexplained can lead to low uptake (Ochieng et al 2017).A lack of access to communication devices such asradios, televisions and mobile telephones used intransmitting forecast can limit who is able to use thisinformation (Ochieng et al 2017). Challenges in acces-sing forecast information may be compounded bygender, with female farmers having lower access toWCS than their male counterparts (Oyekale 2015,Carr et al 2016).3.4.2. Relevance and capacity to actEnsuring that information is accessible and under-standable is not sufficient to guarantee uptake. Whereforecast information is not provided at the right timefor decision making, or is provided at an inappropriatespatial scale, it may lack relevance for users. Even whenforecasts contain decision relevant information, and arereceived and understood by their intended audience,there may be barriers to the utilisation of this informa-tion indecisionmaking. For instance, farmersmay havelimited capacity to act on forecast information due tolack of access to improved seed varieties, inadequateinformation about performance of improved varieties,andhigh seedprice (Fisher et al2015). Similarly, povertyand competing demand for other livelihood challenges,along with lack of access to farm inputs, land, equip-ment, and credit can mean that they are unable to takeadaptive actions in response to WCS information (Tallet al 2014). At a national and institutional level, lack oflong-term historical climate information, insufficienttechnological, infrastructural and human resources,low level of economic development and poor institu-tional capacity are also highlighted as barriers to theuptake ofWCS in SSA (e.g.Dinku et al2014).3.4.3. TrustLack of trust in forecasts or forecast providersrepresents a key barrier to forecast uptake. In SSA thismay be particularly pronounced due to risk involve intaking decisions based on forecasts with no socialprotection mechanisms to safeguard users when fore-casts fail (Tall et al 2014). Amongst agrarian commu-nities in SSA indigenous forecasting methods whichhave been relied on to enhance resilience to thevagaries of weather over centuries, may be highlytrusted. Where corresponding trust in state providedinformation is low, it may be difficult to combine theinformation from two sources for the benefits of theWCSusers (Jiri et al 2016).3.4.4. Institutional barriersAt an institutional level, key barriers to the use offorecasts for early warning action in Africa has beenattributed to inaccessibility of WCS, low level ofrelevance of warnings to humanitarian responseteams, and lack of communication between theforecast providers and the humanitarian responseteam (Baudoin and Wolde-Georgis 2015). In Senegal,the poor management of disasters using early warningsystem is attributed to many factors including thepolitical and personal appropriation of disaster man-agement-related processes, the dichotomy betweencentral government and municipalities, and fragmen-ted institutional framework with overlapping roles(Schaer and Hanonou 2017). Results from multipleprojects in Kenya indicated that even whenWCS pilotprojects demonstrate the potential to provide highbenefits for target sectors, these may ultimately fail toscale-up to operational services, as clear financialmodels for sustainability are often not mainstreamedat the project design state (Singh et al 2016). In EastAfrica, the humanitarian response teams complainedthat they do not have sufficient information aboutvulnerable communities due to the absence of riskmaps (Baudoin et al 2016, Lumbroso et al 2016).3.4.5. Addressing barriersOur review shows that belonging to a social group suchas a farmer-based organisation, having access to loansand owning a mobile phone were important factorsthat influenced the uptake of WCS in West and EastAfrica (Amegnaglo et al 2017, Tarchiani et al 2017,Oladele et al 2018). Given the role of farmer basedorganisations in influencing the uptake of WCS bylocal communities, providers of WCS should work inpartnership with other institutions which have alreadyestablished such groups and use them as entry pointsto disseminate WCS. Given the high penetration rateof mobile communication in SSA, WCS providerscould create partnerships with such companies tofacilitate the dissemination of WCS information toend users.3.5. Impact of capacity building and co-productionof knowledge in the uptake ofWCSProfessional development of personnel workingat NMHSs is a critical factor in the provision anddelivery of WCS in SSA (Lamb et al 2011, WMO 2013,8Environ. Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et alDe La Poterie et al 2018, Hansen et al (2019)). Thisreview shows that capacity building courses providedto personnel through different projects shouldinclude: engagement in the conceptualisation of WCSto facilitate the development of forecasting productsthat maximise societal value; guidance on how todownload outputs from global forecasting systemsand cascade them to their country level, the interpreta-tion and verification of forecasts at different time-scales, training on the use of new forecast productsand software, computer coding and the use of highperformance computers.Through the Enhancing National Climate Services(ENACTS) initiative, personnel at NMHSs in Senegaland Kenya have been trained on how to develop high-resolution, spatially and temporally complete griddedhistorical meteorological datasets and disseminatethem through web-based platforms. This initiative ishelping the NMHSs in these countries to provideenhanced WCS by overcoming the challenges of dataquality, availability and access (Dinku et al 2018).In Ghana and Kenya, the Participatory ScenarioPlanning (PSP) approachwas amended to train farmerson how to interpret forecasts uncertainties (Ambaniand Percy 2011). Using this approach, local communityusers of WCS (representing different farming groups)and climate scientists from NMHSs came togetherbefore the onset of the rainy season to use local and sci-entific knowledge to contextualise forecasts and createappropriate suite of possible adaptation measures forthe farmers (Ambani and Percy 2011). Owing to its suc-cess, the approach was adopted in other projects in theregion (e.g. Ambani and Fiona 2014). Moreover, it hasbeen mainstreamed as government policy in Kenya tofacilitate bottom-up community-led disaster risk man-agement and food security coordination (Nurye 2016).Our review also shows that access to extension ser-vices and proximity of NMHSs to farmers can facilitatethe adoption and trust inWCS through enhanced colla-boration between the NMHSs personnel, agricultureextension officers and famers (Stigter et al2013).In Senegal, the NMS has put in place a system totrain, disseminate and share forecasts to users of WCSthrough different projects in the country. A mech-anism to disseminate forecast through Short MessageService (SMS) and community radios has also beenput in place. Through these initiatives, more than 3million users of WCS mostly farmers and fishermenreceive forecast on a regular basis.Impact based forecasting represents another poten-tial means to improve the delivery and uptake ofWCS inSSA. This approach, which is endorsed by the WMO(WMO 2015), goes beyond providing forecasts aboutmeteorological conditions alone, linking forecast infor-mation tousers relevant impacts of users. This reviewhashighlighted the importance of impact-based forecaststhrough the coupling of forecast to impact models suchas a cropmodel, rainfall-runoffmodel andflood inunda-tionmodel to assess decision-relevant impact thresholds.4.Discussion and conclusionsThis paper has used a systematic literature reviewapproach to identify the forecast timescales that aremost relevant to the users of WCS, highlight thebenefits that users of WCS derive from using theseproducts and identify the barriers to the delivery anduptake ofWCS across SSA.Our review shows that the forecast timescalesdemanded by users of WCS, forecast lead times andmethods of communicating the forecasts remain sec-tor specific. In contrast to the agriculture and foodsecurity sector where communication mediums areimportant for user uptake of WCS, this is less impor-tant for disaster management and water sectors.Experts in these sectors are better equipped to dealwith scientific information about forecast uncertainty.However, unlike the agricultural sector where farmerscan take immediate forecast-based decisions, thesesectors require that forecasts be processed using othertools to define decision-relevant impact thresholdssuch as the threshold discharge in a river that is neededto trigger a hydrological drought orfloodingwarning.In the agriculture and food security sector, theprovision of timely and well-tailored WCS enableddifferent user groups within the sector tomake impor-tant livelihood decisions that enhanced their resilienceto climate shocks and delivered multiple benefits.These included: increased crop yields and timely pur-chase of fungicides and pesticides for farmers, preven-tion of farmer–pastoralist conflicts in the Sahel,purchase of new livestock breeds, making life savingdecisions e.g. avoiding lightning and flooding zonesfor pastoralists and their animals, and the preventionand efficientmanagement of humanitarian disasters.For small-holder farmers and pastoralists, needsgo beyond the provision of timely weather and short-term climate information and should be accompaniedby advisory information to help them to makeinformed decisions about their farming and pastoralactivities. For policymakers using seasonal forecasts torun agriculture impactmodels to predict regional cropyield is critical for making decisions on food security.It also help them to determine if crop failure is anemergency situation that needs external support andtherefore make timely contacts with donor agencies toavert food insecurity. To promote the use of WCS inSSA, there is need to set-up new farmer-based organi-sations or use existing ones as entry points to facilitatethe delivery of WCS. This review demonstrates thatWCS are useful for enhancing resilience to weatherand climate shocks in the agriculture and food securitysector in SSA. However, for its potential benefits to berealised, it is critical to both address challenges inaccessibility and to tailor provision to the decisionsthat are undertaken by different user groups.For disaster management sector, our findings alsoshow that substantial benefits have been obtained in theuse of WCS especially in West Africa. Many studies9Environ. Res. Lett. 14 (2019) 123003 ENkiaka et alhighlight the benefits of WCS in forecasting droughtsand floods especially for making strategic decisionssuch as the pre-positioning of disaster relief materials,training of local personnel, developing flood con-tingency plans, andmaking requests for pre-emergencyfunding. The need to incorporate women in disastermanagement operationwas also highlighted. The bene-fits ofWCSwere also very substantial in thewaterman-agement sector including, reservoir management,predicting water levels in a river, timing of the floodpeaks anddeterminingmaximumflood extent.In the Lake Victoria basin specifically, it wasobserved that lack of information about the availabilityof WCS by most actors involved in fishing and naviga-tion was a key barrier to its used. Hence, there is needfor regional governments to put in place better commu-nication strategies aimed at raising awareness about thevalue of WCS among the different actors who use thelake to carryout different economic activities. This hasthe potential to reduce the number of weather relatedaccidents and deaths as the skill of numerical weatherprediction models to capture storms, strong winds andstrongwaves in the lake keeps improving.Lack of information on vulnerable communities wasalso identified as a keybarrier impeding theuseof forecastfor early action in disaster management. This indicatesthat apart from improving forecast skills and enhancingforecast communication techniques, attention also has tofocus on identifying the most vulnerable communities/people to different types of weather events. Risk mapsshowing areas that are prone to particular weather trig-gered events should be developed to guide humanitarianresponse teams during disaster preparation. Meanwhilesubstantial work is still needed for WCS to be fully inte-grated in thewatermanagement sector in SSA.To increase the uptake and use ofWCS it is critical toreinforce and sustain collaboration between different sta-keholders (climate scientists, hydrologists, extensionworkers, farmers and other user groups). The advance-ment of WCS relies on multiple factors including;(i) providing forecasts with appropriate spatial extent;(ii) decentralised NMHSs by taking services closer to theusers of WCS; (iii) training a greater number of NMHSsstaff and extensionworkers on relevant techniques to takethis role; (iv) establishingmore social protectionmechan-isms that users can rely on when the forecast fails; and (v)facilitate access to loans for the timely purchase of farminputs, equipment for land preparation, and the purchaseof fodder for pastoralists. The implementation of thesedevelopmental activities have thepotential to enable usersof WCS to continue to realise substantial benefits fromusingweather and short-termclimate information.AcknowledgmentsThisworkwas supportedbyUKResearchand Innovationas part of the Global Challenges Research Fund, AfricaSWIFTprogramme-grantnumberNE/P021077/1.Data availability statementAny data that support the findings of this study areincludedwithin the article.AppendixSummary of empirical studies reviewed by sectorSector ReferencesAgriculture and FoodsecuritySultan et al (2010), Kadi et al (2011),Jost (2013), Onyango et al (2014), Ras-mussen et al (2014), Roudier et al(2014), Tall et al ( 2014), Fisher et al(2015), Kniveton et al (2015), Oyekale(2015), Rasmussen et al (2015), AnugaandGordon (2016), Carr et al (2016),Jost et al (2016),Mertz et al (2016),Roudier et al (2016), Amegnaglo et al(2017), Nyasimi et al (2017), Ochienget al (2017), Tarchiani et al (2017),Mckune et al (2018), Ogutu et al(2018), Oladele et al (2018), Ouedraogoet al (2018), Gbangou et al (2019),Hansen et al (2019), Nyadzi et al (2019)Disastermanagement Tall et al (2013), Tall et al (2012), Boydet al (2013), Braman et al (2013),Baudoin andWolde-Georgis (2015),Baudoin et al (2016),Mwangi et al(2014), Cools et al (2016), Nurye(2016), De Perez et al (2017), Haineset al (2017), Thiery et al (2017), De LaPoterie et al (2018), Olaniyan et al(2018), Kiwanuka-Tondo et al (2019),Batté et al (2018),WMO (2013),Caruson et al (2014), Hamer et al (2017)Water resourcesmanage-ment and hydropowerZiervogel et al (2010), Lamb et al(2011), Dinku et al (2014), Guzinskiet al (2014), Sheffield et al (2014),Wet-terhall et al (2015), Cools et al (2016),Haines et al (2017),Mcnally et al (2017)Barriers Carr et al (2016), Jiri et al (2016), Lum-broso et al (2016), Singh et al (2016),Schaer andHanonou (2017), Tall et al(2014)ORCID iDsEliasNkiaka https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7362-9430Andrea Taylor https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8949-1234EmmaMwangi https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3838-0849ReferencesAdgerWN,Dessai S, GouldenM,HulmeM, Lorenzoni I,NelsonDR,Naess LO,Wolf J andWreford A 2009Are theresocial limits to adaptation to climate change?Clim.
