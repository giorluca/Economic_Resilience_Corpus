As a result, many small-scale food producers faced difficulties growing, harvesting, and selling their goods. This participatory research examines local small-scale farmers’ challenges as farmers but also as consumers and their coping strategies during the month of April and one week in June 2020. The study was initiated and conceptualized in collaboration with small-scale farmer members of an existing research network in selected urban and rural areas in South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, and Indonesia. Participants co-designed the research, collected and uploaded data through digital survey tools, and contributed to data analysis and interpretation. A common observation across regions is that the measures imposed in response to COVID-19 highlighted and partly exacerbated existing socio-economic inequalities among food system actors. Strict lockdowns in Cape Town, South Africa, and Masvingo, Zimbabwe, signifcantly restricted the production capacity of small-scale farmers in the informal economy and created more food insecurity for them. In Maputo, Mozambique, and Toraja and Java, Indonesia, local food systems continued to operate and were even strengthened by higher social capital and adaptive capacities.

Introduction Worldwide, most food is produced by small-scale farmers (we use the term “small-scale farmer” and “farmer” interchangeably throughout the document), yet these farmers face hunger and vulnerability to food insecurity [1]. This becomes particularly apparent in times of shocks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of 2020, the world, and especially marginalized groups, felt the severe impact of national lockdowns in response to the novel coronavirus. Civil society actors, scholars, the FAO, and the World Food Programme (WFP) alike raised legitimate concerns about the pandemic’s impact on low-income households’ livelihoods and food security [2–4]. Measures considered necessary from an epidemiological perspective have resulted in devastating consequences primarily in the informal sector leading to the loss of jobs and income for millions and considerable food insecurity crises [5]. Government decisions on how and when to respond to the pandemic refected low levels of preparedness and consultation with key stakeholders, including food system actors who questioned how to bolster food system resiliency during shocks like the COVID-19 crisis [6]. The pandemic exposed fault lines in existing food systems, such as underlying structural inequalities stemming from colonialism (and apartheid and post-apartheid, in South Africa), gender inequalities, concentration of market power in a few global companies, global supply chains and dependencies on food imports, food insecurity due to price fuctuations, and the harm caused by the industrialized agriculture sector, with severe ecosystem impacts [7,8]. Béné (2020) argues that the virus itself does not pose as much of a threat to the lives of billions as do its negative consequences on food system resilience, which is understood as the ability of households and communities to cope with shocks without having a long-term negative impact on wellbeing and functioning of these food systems [6]. Organizations such as the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES) and the Transnational Institute as well as international scholars argue the pandemic opened opportunities for transforming current exclusionary food systems to meet societal needs [7,9–12]. The COVID-19 pandemic offers the unique opportunity to rethink and fundamentally reshape local food systems to become more just and socially inclusive, and in doing so, address the root causes of poverty and hunger. This study is an initiative of urban, landless research farmers in Cape Town who did not want to see the COVID-19 pandemic as yet another external shock to their farming systems. Rather, they instituted co-research beyond borders to examine the specifc challenges to and opportunities for food system resilience from small-scale farmers’ perspectives in urban, peri-urban, and rural settings. Small-scale farmers in all research sites farm on small pieces of land; most of them apply labor-intensive techniques and do not rely on technologies. We frmly believe that those who are most affected should be involved in mutual understanding of the challenges and, in the process, co-creating solutions. This study presents results that emerged from weekly surveys conducted during four weeks in April and the frst week of June 2020 with 707 small-scale farmers from fve regions in the Global South: Java and Toraja in Indonesia, Maputo in Mozambique, Cape Town in South Africa, and Masvingo in Zimbabwe. Small-scale farmers from these regions co-designed the study, collected data, participated in the analysis and interpretation of the results, and contributed writing to this paper. Our co-research is inspired by a people’s science approach [13] and provides in-depth insights into the experiences of small-scale farmers in these areas. 1.1. Theoretical Framework We drew on several frameworks to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on local food systems to inform our own theoretical framework for the study (Figure 1). We applied an adapted food system resilience framework based on Béné (2020, 16), understanding food system resilience as an opportunity Sustainability 2020, 12, 8556 3 of 26 to alleviate faults and build capacities (coping capacity, adaptive capacity, transformative capacity) to ameliorate future uncertainty and/or shocks [14,15]. We also drew on Martin’s (2012, 5) work on resilience in food systems, which is defned as “the ability of the system to undergo anticipatory or reactionary reorganization of form and/or function so as to minimize impact of a destabilizing shock” [16]. Moreover, we referred to Frankenberger et al. (2012) to discuss underlying stress factors on resilience (e.g., institutional, structural, socio-economic, and environmental) that infuence the level of vulnerability. Long-term issues, such as climate change or increasing marginalization, either aggravate the vulnerability of households or increase their adaptive capacity [17]. Communities’ or households’ coping capacities cushion shocks while their adaptive capacities build on the immediate environment within the family and community (social capital) and provide the fexibility to cope with shocks. Finally, transformative capacity is the solution space that provides the opportunity to create longer-term change to sustainably improve the community and household food system.

Resilience framework of local food systems impacted by shocks. Adapted from Béné (2020) [6] and Frankenberger et al. (2012) [17]. As Béné (2020) points out, there is little information on resilience of local food systems from different actor perspectives. This research seeks to contribute to this gap by providing a small-scale farmer perspective on the impact of COVID-19 and food system resilience [6]. We shed light on the challenges experienced by small-scale farmers and the strategies they employed while navigating COVID-19 restrictions, while also highlighting how these challenges and strategies vary by gender. Co-researchers collected farmer perspectives from five case study areas in the Global South, which all were linked in previous research projects coordinated with this consortium: rice farmers in Java, Indonesia, who sell their produce to local consumers; farmers in Toraja, Indonesia, who sell produce at local farmers markets; peri-urban farmers in Maputo, Mozambique, who sell produce within their neighborhoods; urban farmers in Cape Town, South Africa, who create distribution channels within townships; and farmers in the Masvingo area of Zimbabwe, who distribute their produce to the city center. We aim to answer the following specific questions: 1. What challenges are female and male small-scale farmers facing when producing food and selling their goods during the lockdown/state of emergency? Figure 1.

Study Context The following sub-chapters describe the fve research sites’ demography with respect to agricultural systems, COVID-19 infections, and mitigation strategies employed during the study period (April to June 2020). The study was initiated as an ad-hoc study with existing partners from different projects. While Indonesia and Mozambique introduced social restrictions, partners in South Africa and Zimbabwe were confronted with lockdowns and curfews. The COVID-19 pandemic has emphatically highlighted the fundamental need to develop shock resilience mechanisms in agrarian systems. The study describes experiences from fve research sites in four countries, each differing in local conditions (such as climate, history, and land rights) as well as the COVID-19 responses observed, yet sharing commonalities as low-income countries with limited access to advanced technology and high levels of susceptibility to shocks (such as climate change or the loss of biodiversity). 1.2.1. Indonesia With 262 million inhabitants spreading over an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world. Agriculture contributes only 14 percent to GDP, but employs 33 percent of the labor force in 25 million holdings [18,19]. In fact, 93 percent of farmers are very small-scale, as they produce on an average of 0.6 hectares. The informal sector is very much dominated by agriculture with almost half (45%) of the informal workers being employed in this sector [20]. While the national poverty rate is estimated at 9.2 percent, 56.5 percent of informal workers and 18.0 percent of smallholder farmers live in poverty [20]. Small-scale farmers from two areas of Indonesia participated in the study: Java and Toraja. The densely populated Java island is the heart of rice production, with almost every farm producing rice. However, the typical 0.25 hectare plot does not allow for food or income sufficiency, meaning farmers in the area rely on rice imports and off-farm informal income. The rural food region of Toraja on Sulawesi island is mountainous and a popular tourist destination. 80 percent of the population relies on agriculture for income with small-scale farmers growing mainly rice and coffee on less than 2 hectares, along with some vegetables and cocoa. As the pandemic particularly puts the livelihoods of poor and informally employed people at risk, Indonesian farmers could be disproportionally affected. After initially downplaying the crisis and underreporting cases and deaths, the Indonesian government implemented a strategy to mitigate the economic downturn, including putting “large-scale social restrictions” in place and signing them into law on 31 March 2020. This regulation allowed local governments—districts or cities—to restrict the movement of individuals and goods within a region upon approval of the Ministry of Health. Local governments were, therefore, able to choose systems that they felt best suited local needs with restrictions ranging from no limitations of movement to quasi-lockdowns and strict stay-at-home orders. Importantly, the most severe restrictions occurred during Eid al-Fitr (Idul Fitri), which prevented internal migrants from visiting their families. A timeline of new infections and government response is provided in Figure 2. Sustainability 2020, 12, 8556 5 of 26 Sustainability 2020, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 27  Figure 2.

Mozambique While Mozambique relies on small-scale family farming in rural areas, the capital Maputo is a major transshipment port for the region and is highly dependent on food imports. Maputo faces severe food insecurity, with 70% of the cities’ population food insecure [22]. The lack of food availability lies in structural poverty; markets and market structure; policy dysfunction; relative affordability of different types of food; food safety challenges wrought by inadequate urban infrastructure; and inadequate household food storage, refrigeration, and cooking technologies [23]. Unlike other African capitals, population growth in Maputo city is not rapid [23], and the majority of the population depends on the informal economy (about 70% of the population) or urban agriculture and fisheries (15%) [24]. In fact, Maputo has an economically important peri-urban agriculture sector, which employs and feeds some ten thousand city farmers who are organized in associations and their informal intermediaries [25]. Though peri-urban agriculture positively contributes to food availability, external factors continue to threaten food security in the area, particularly urban migration; natural shocks including floods, droughts, and cyclones (most notably, cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019); and armed insurgencies in the central and northern regions. Though Mozambique’s reported COVID-19 case load has remained relatively low since their first reported case in March 2020, the increasing number of cases remained a concern during the study period, particularly as neighboring South Africa reported heavy infection rates and is a crucial trade partner. The national government declared a state of emergency, restricted movement in public space, and closed international borders, though allowing limited food imports. Since then, the country has declared states of emergency thrice, each time limiting the movement of people and severely impacting the economy and food production (see Figure 3). . . 1.2.2.

In 2014, the South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES) found that 26% of South Africans face hunger, with a further 28% being in danger of being subjected to hunger [26]. In Cape Town, thousands of urban dwellers grow food in backyards to mitigate this issue. Depending on the season, urban farmers—mostly elderly, unemployed women—cultivate between 100 and 200 larger food gardens (100 m2–1 ha) on public grounds [25]. Most urban farmers are integrated into formal food value chains affiliated with intermediary programs that sell produce from township food gardens to restaurants, hotels, and markets in better-off city quarters [25]. Hunger and unemployment became more severe during the COVID-19 pandemic; in May 2020, the Human Sciences Research Council reported that 34 percent of South Africans went to bed hungry [26,27]. The South African government imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in the world (see Figure 4), including curfews and closing the informal sector, which significantly impacted the food system and flow of goods [28]. This resulted in massive job losses, especially in the informal sector, which employs one in every six South Africans—particularly people of color [28,29]. The strict lockdown also meant that 9 million learners who receive meals through the National School Nutrition Programme were denied access to meals, thus exacerbating hunger in poor neighborhoods [30]. Alarmingly high levels of food insecurity persist in low-income households—especially for people of color—with almost three quarters of low-income households experiencing hunger and the greatest burden falling on informal dwellers, female-headed households, and households with irregular sources of income [31]. For these households, the COVID-19 lockdown has been disproportionately severe. This study took place in Cape Town where levels of diabetes, hypertension, and obesity are all higher than the national average. These non-communicable diseases have been linked with poverty and nutrition transition leading to the consumption of cheap, high-fat, and sugary foods [26–28,32,33]. Diabetes and hypertension were the most prevalent co-morbidities present in Western Cape COVID-19 deaths by mid-June 2020 [34]. COVID-19 has revealed the deep-rooted race and class inequalities, with people of color already experiencing the brunt of unemployment and hunger.

Zimbabwe The study area in Masvingo province is situated in the drier south-eastern lowveld of the country and has an area of 56,566 km2 and a population of about 1.5 million. The province is predominantly semi-arid and experiences erratic rainfall and frequent droughts. The cultivation of drought-resistant small grains, such as sorghum and millet, has been actively promoted by government; however, the land distribution program implemented by the Zimbabwean government two decades ago has resulted in reduced food production by both commercial and small-scale farmers in most parts of the country. Recurrent droughts and the economic meltdown have increased poverty and food insecurity in rural communal areas where farmers produce staple foods such as maize, millet, and groundnuts. Although food is readily available in supermarkets and informal food markets, many low-income households cannot meet food price increases. Home gardens in Masvingo city are an essential component of the local food systems [37,38]. By mid-March, the Zimbabwean government had declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency and introduced travel restrictions and banned large gatherings. By 23 March, additional measures were introduced, including closure of national borders to non-essential travel and closure of social, entertainment, and sporting facilities. On 27 March, the government announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown that was subsequently extended with a reversal of previous restrictions on selling of alcohol (see Figure 5). Figure 4.

First, we designed and conducted a digital survey using a co-research approach. We use the term “co-research” to mean research in which small-scale farmers (or co-researchers: community researchers) were involved in all steps of the research process from the design of the study to data collection, analysis, and writing. We then remotely triangulated, analyzed, and drew conclusions from the data together with local co-researching farmers. This allowed us to survey the same farmers and evaluate the changes in their perceptions over time. The data for this study were collected using the digital KoBoToolbox data collection tool in five phases: one survey per week in April 2020 and one survey in the first week of June 2020. KoBoToolbox is an open source application, which is owned and operated by Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. The tool aims to support data collection in challenging environments, humanitarian crises and aid, and international research [39]. Questionnaires were digitally available in English (Cape Town and Masvingo), Portuguese (Maputo), and Indonesian (Java and Toraja) with the validation survey containing four qualitative and 22 quantitative questions. In the process of data collection, the questionnaire was further refined and improved through constant feedback from the participants. The final questionnaire is attached as an appendix. The survey was administered to farmer members of NGOs/CBOs as follows: in Indonesia, by Jaringan Masyarakat Tani Indonesia (JAMTANI) and Motivator Kondoran; in South Africa, by the Cape Town Urban Farmer Club; in Mozambique by Associação pela Agricultura Biológica, Biodiversidade e Desenvolvimento Sustentável (Abiodes) in Maputo; and in Zimbabwe, by The Hope Tariro Trust in Masvingo. However, a limitation and potential bias in the study is that only those farmers who were able to fill in the questionnaire on their own smartphones participated. In Mozambique, enumerators conducted telephone interviews with farmers and filled in the digital survey tool. In Zimbabwe, due to poor connectivity, farmers sent their survey answers via WhatsApp and the supporting researchers entered the data into the KoBoToolbox.  Participating farmer groups joined regional WhatsApp groups, which were moderated by research facilitators for each region. The surveys were conducted in April, when lockdowns and states of emergency were first declared. In May, preliminary data analyses were shared with co-researchers and commented upon in WhatsApp groups.

Materials and Methods We carried out this study in two parts. First, we designed and conducted a digital survey using a co-research approach. We use the term “co-research” to mean research in which small-scale farmers (or co-researchers: community researchers) were involved in all steps of the research process from the design of the study to data collection, analysis, and writing. We then remotely triangulated, analyzed, and drew conclusions from the data together with local co-researching farmers. This allowed us to survey the same farmers and evaluate the changes in their perceptions over time. The data for this study were collected using the digital KoBoToolbox data collection tool in fve phases: one survey per week in April 2020 and one survey in the frst week of June 2020. KoBoToolbox is an open source application, which is owned and operated by Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. The tool aims to support data collection in challenging environments, humanitarian crises and aid, and international research [39]. Questionnaires were digitally available in English (Cape Town and Masvingo), Portuguese (Maputo), and Indonesian (Java and Toraja) with the validation survey containing four qualitative and 22 quantitative questions. In the process of data collection, the questionnaire was further refned and improved through constant feedback from the participants. The fnal questionnaire is attached as an appendix. The survey was administered to farmer members of NGOs/CBOs as follows: in Indonesia, by Jaringan Masyarakat Tani Indonesia (JAMTANI) and Motivator Kondoran; in South Africa, by the Cape Town Urban Farmer Club; in Mozambique by Associação pela Agricultura Biológica, Biodiversidade e Desenvolvimento Sustentável (Abiodes) in Maputo; and in Zimbabwe, by The Hope Tariro Trust in Masvingo. However, a limitation and potential bias in the study is that only those farmers who were able to fll in the questionnaire on their own smartphones participated. In Mozambique, enumerators conducted telephone interviews with farmers and flled in the digital survey tool. In Zimbabwe, due to poor connectivity, farmers sent their survey answers via WhatsApp and the supporting researchers entered the data into the KoBoToolbox. Participating farmer groups joined regional WhatsApp groups, which were moderated by research facilitators for each region. The surveys were conducted in April, when lockdowns and states of emergency were frst declared. In May, preliminary data analyses were shared with co-researchers and commented upon in WhatsApp groups. Co-researchers discussed and triangulated preliminary results via WhatsApp groups, made recommendations for an improved process (for example, the use of enumerators in Toraja to encourage participation where technology was prohibitive), and designed Sustainability 2020, 12, 8556 9 of 26 a fnal survey for all regions; this survey was conducted in the frst week of June and the results presented in this paper were gathered from this fnal survey. Answers were translated then cleaned by standardizing spellings, removing fller words (and, or, those, the...), and linking words used in terms such as “no” and “income” before illustrating them in graphs or word clouds using MAXQDA. Analysis of quantitative data was coordinated in Berlin by two researchers and two student assistants using descriptive statistics (SPSS 25). In June and July 2020, the fve research coordinators of the regions jointly analyzed and validated the local context in three in-depth discussions with a larger research consortium consisting of representatives of farmer organizations who worked in collaboration with researchers from the University of the Western Cape in South Africa, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane in Mozambique, Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin in Germany, and Coventry University in the UK. 3. Results This section focuses on the information collected in the frst week of June 2020. The fndings are presented in three sub-sections. First, the challenges farmers experienced in their farming and marketing activities as a result of COVID-19 preventative measures are described. Second, the impacts on farmers’ livelihoods and their communities are illustrated. Third, the perceived food price fuctuations and consequent changes in diets, food sources, and consumption patterns are presented. The section closes with description of the coping strategies that farmers developed. Table 1 shows the number of respondents who were interviewed each week. The number of respondents snowballed as participating farmer co-researchers recruited additional farmers from their communities to participate; however, participation was somewhat restricted by the initial study design, in which farmers were required to use their own device to complete the survey. In the second week in April, the team in Maputo was not able to collect data due to the COVID-19 restrictions during that week. Table 1. Number of respondents interviewed.

Farmers’ Perceptions of the Impact of COVID-19 Interventions on Their Access to Their Farms and Markets A striking observation is that in the countries that observed strict lockdown such as South Africa and Zimbabwe, small-scale farms were not regarded as “essential services” resulting in farmers being unable to access their farms and markets (see Figure 6). In South Africa, small-scale farmers did not receive permits to continue their farming activities [36]. In Zimbabwe, 32 percent of the surveyed farmers reported difficulties accessing their farms. In contrast, in the rest of the study sites, small-scale farms were regarded as essential and almost all participants could access their farms.

A similar dynamic was observed in farmers’ ability to sell their products. Cape Town and Masvingo farmers were the most affected by market disruptions, making it impossible to sell their produce. Farmers in Maputo and in the two Indonesian regions were the least affected by marketing disruptions as they continued to sell to local communities; in fact, local demand increased as food imports from South Africa were restricted.

In Cape Town, farmer respondents reported selling their products to local communities 25% more frequently to compensate for the loss of demand from and sales to restaurants and high-end markets due to COVID-19 restrictions. Similarly, urban farmers responded to the temporary cessation of NGO retail markets by establishing neighborhood WhatsApp marketing groups and initiating word-of-mouth advertising for their produce. Masvingo followed a similar pattern with farmers actively compensating for the reduction of sales to restaurants, high-end markets, and farmers markets by marketing to local communities 37 percent more often. As in Cape Town, farmers used their produce to meet their own needs 5 percent less frequently after the lockdowns. In Maputo, the inverse situation was reported, with farmers reporting marketing to local communities 11 percent less frequently and own consumption increasing by 14 percent. In Toraja, minor changes were reported, with produce largely used for own consumption and a 3 percent increase in sales to local communities. Java experienced only minor changes, with a decrease in sales to local communities of 3 percent and an increase in produce used for own consumption of 3 percent. 3.2.

Cape Town (n = 52), Masvingo (n = 53), Maputo (n = 28), Java (n = 114), Toraja (n = 209). In Cape Town, food insecurity and hunger were mentioned by farmers as the main impacts of the lockdown. Farmers further observed a rise in poverty and unemployment, leading to hunger and higher levels of crime. In Masvingo, farmers documented experiencing hunger and food insecurity due to shortages of food and spiking food prices. In their communities, market closures, economic recession, and more thefts were also documented. Food was mentioned by farmers as their most significant need, followed by creating awareness about hygiene measures and materials to battle COVID-19. In Maputo, farmers perceived the primary impact of COVID-19 interventions to be the lack of customers, which limited their income. They also mentioned the closure of businesses, shops, schools, places of worship, and the limited movement of people (particularly not being able to visit family). Farmers felt COVID-19 control strategies should focus on reduction of transmission including widespread mask use and public education on transmission reduction through simple interventions such as handwashing. In Java, farmers documented difficulties travelling to other regions of the country or visiting relatives outside Java. Migrant workers were unable to return home or have their relatives return, especially impacting Eid al-Fitr celebrations. Other reported impacts were related to school closures; reductions in income and work; and reductions in community, social, and religious interactions. This particularly affected musyawarah, which is a form of consensus building resulting from prolonged discussions and sharing of ideas and views during a meeting. In Toraja, farmers were concerned about not being able to go outside, perform their usual activities, meet their neighbors and families, and visit places of worship. They reported feeling frustrated by being barred from religious gatherings, as they perceived religious activities as playing a significant role in the impact of COVID-19.  3.3.

Source: June 2020. In Cape Town, reports of increases in the prices of meat after COVID-19 interventions were implemented far exceeded increases in other food prices. Consequently, a decrease in meat consumption was reported by 70 percent of the sample. Similarly, other surveyed regions reported that consumption of vegetables and grains increased during COVID-19 intervention implementation, with 72 percent of women reporting eating more staples and grains compared to 50 percent of men. Overall, 85 percent of farmers documented that price changes limited their ability to acquire food. With lockdowns, 6 percent and 12 percent of farmers reported sourcing food less frequently from local vendors and supermarkets, respectively. The number of farmers who sourced food from soup kitchens and donations from family and friends increased by 8 percent and 9 percent, respectively, with more women than men reporting receiving food donations from family and friends (31 and 15 percent).  In Masvingo, over 85 percent of farmers reported food prices had increased during COVID-19 intervention implementation, which coincides with an already-critical period of economic crisis and hyperinflation. Farmer respondents reported eating less of most foods, except vegetables and grains. Again, results were gender specific, with 56 percent of women reporting they consumed less fruit versus 31 percent of men and 75 percent of women stating that they consumed more staples and grains compared to 56 percent of men. Overall, 92 percent of farmers reported that price changes limited their ability to acquire food. Remarkably, farmers shopped 12 percent and 5 percent less frequently from traditional food markets and supermarkets, preferring to source food from their own gardens and farms 19 percent more frequently. Maputo farmers saw their ability to acquire food during lockdowns as extremely diminished, with 96 percent of farmers reporting limitations. Sugar was reported as the product with the most drastic price change, a predictable outcome of the limitation of South African imports. Local sugar producers took advantage of this situation and increased prices. Farmers also reported an increase in their grain consumption. As markets were disrupted, consumption in supermarkets and local markets decreased by 3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, during the state of emergency. Consumption from their own farms or gardens increased by 3 percent while receiving food from neighbors and donations from the community increased by 5 percent.  Figure 12.

Unlike all southern African study areas, the Indonesian government distributed food aid to Indonesians, with 74 percent of Toraja farmers and 47 percent of Java farmers reporting they received government food parcels. Lower participation in Java was due to limited supplies spread over a higher population in Java. Despite this, farmers reported that price increases for all foods surpassed 50 percent, with fruit price increases reported by 94 percent of respondents. The consumption fell sharply as a result, which was similar for fsh and meat. These food groups are mostly distrib
