Though the literature on organizational resilience indicates that this is best understood as a process through which organizational actors respond to a specific shock, most IS research attends to resilience as an outcome. Against that backdrop, we present a case study of how a university shifted to virtual teaching in response to a government-imposed lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adopting a digital resourcing perspective allowed us to reveal the organizational resilience process and the way digital resources shaped it. We found that the resilience process unfolded in stages as educators, assisted by students, managers, and IT personnel pivoted, adapted, and normalized into teaching virtually. Across these stages, digital resources took on specific roles as the resilience process progressed from the organization’s pre-shock accumulation of digital resources into its continued digitalization efforts. Based on these findings, we contribute to existing literature by advancing and empirically substantiating a process view of the role of digital resources in organizational resilience.   1. Introduction Recent events of major exogenous shock have reinvigorated Infor-mation Systems (IS) literature on resilience (Boh, Constantinides, Pad-manabhan, & Viswanathan, 2023; Liu, Xu, Jin, & Deng, 2023; Park, Son, & Angst, 2023; Rai, 2020; Tremblay, Kohli, & Rivero, 2023). Since exogenous shocks are existential threats that pose continuous and long-term risks to different entities, they have widespread implications for IS research and practice. Exogenous shock can disrupt normal IS functioning by causing damage to digital infrastructure, data centers, and other critical systems, but they also represent opportunities for innovation by leveraging digital technologies to transform current op-erations. The global COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many aspects of daily life and led to national lockdowns, social distancing, and virtual work arrangements, and scholars have demonstrated how organizations, including higher-education institutions, were able to continue functioning by leveraging digital technologies at the same time as creating opportunities for innovation (Barnes, 2020; Bhagat & Kim, 2020; Carroll & Conboy, 2020; Carugati et al., 2020; Chatterjee et al., 2021; Pandey & Pal, 2020; Ratten, 2022). To help understand such responses to exogenous shock, a rich body of literature has evolved under the conceptual umbrella of organiza-tional resilience (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007; Williams et al., 2017) with roots in such varied disciplines as ecology (Holling, 1973), engineering (Hollnagel et al., 2006), economics (Gittell et al., 2006), and psychology (Masten & Obradović, 2006). However, although this literature in-dicates that resilience is best understood as a process in which organi-zational actors continuously learn from their responses and feed the insights they gain into modified and new responses (Williams et al., 2017), extant literature lacks empirical and theoretical insights into the role played by digital technologies in shaping organizational resilience over time (Müller et al., 2013). Hence, current IS research offers only * Corresponding author. E-mail address: agger@dps.aau.dk (J.A. Nielsen).

Given that researchers have long sought to understand how digital technologies contribute to turbulent environments (Butler & Gray, 2006; El Sawy, Malhotra, Park, & Pavlou, 2010; Salovaara, Lyytinen, & Penttinen, 2019; Sambamurthy, Bharadwaj, & Grover, 2003), there is ample opportunity to address this void based on the foundational insight that what matters is not technologies per se, but what people can do with them. Accordingly, we adopt a resourcing perspective (Deken et al., 2018; Feldman, 2004; Linnenluecke, 2017) and shift our attention to the broader notion of digital resources defined here as digital technologies, their use, and the related experiences and skills that enable organizational action (Melville et al., 2004; Sandberg et al., 2014; Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007). This framing allows us to examine the organizational resilience process and the way digital resources shape it over time (Sandberg et al., 2014; Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007). In addition, it allows us to consider not only digital technologies and their use, but also the related experiences and skills of organizational actors (Feldman, 2004; Melville et al., 2004). Hence, we ask the following research question: How does organizational resilience unfold as actors leverage digital resources in response to an exog-enous shock? This calls for careful attention to the role played by digital resources, including the ways in which they are accessed, mobilized and activated to enact specific response strategies (Linnenluecke, 2017; Hillmann & Guenther, 2021). To address the research question, we investigate how a Danish uni-versity shifted to virtual teaching following a government-imposed lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a detailed ac-count of how educators, assisted by students, managers, and IT personnel, leveraged digital resources to pivot, adapt, and normalize into virtual teaching. In addition, we explain how digital resources took on different roles across these stages as the resilience process unfolded and propelled the organization forward from the pre-shock accumula-tion of digital resources to its continued digitalization efforts. Together, these insights allow us to advance and empirically substantiate a process view of the role of digital resources in organizational resilience, as a contribution to the literature. 2. Literature background 2.1. Organizational resilience Derived from the Latin resilire, “resilience” means to bounce back or recover from a disturbance (Hollnagel et al., 2006). The concept origi-nated in ecology research (Holling, 1973), where it referred to a sys-tem’s ability to withstand and survive disturbances, but has since generated significant interest across scientific disciplines where it rep-resents “a broad conceptual umbrella, covering many concepts related to positive patterns of adaptation in the context of adversity” (Masten & Obradović, 2006, p. 14). Its usefulness as a scholarly concept is debated (DesJardine et al., 2019) because resilience has been defined, oper-ationalized and applied differently across multiple fields of study, including individuals, groups, and organizations. Still, there is general agreement that resilience is an important concept in understanding how organizations “respond to and recover from duress or disturbances with minimal effects on stability and functioning” (Williams et al., 2017, p. 740). In organization and management science, scholars have used the concept to define not only the organizational characteristics that maintain desirable functions and outcomes under challenging condi-tions (Linnenluecke, 2017) but also the dynamics that are involved in responding and adapting to unexpected events (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007). These definitions reveal a tension between an outcome and a process view of organizational resilience. Resilience as an outcome means an organization is able to “rebound from unexpected, stressful, adverse situations and to pick up where it left off” (Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011, p. 244). This reflects an assumption about organizational function and performance as optimal equilibrium states (Holling, 1973), where resilience is the outcome of a “perfectly elastic mechanical system, where any energy that is absorbed can be emitted without any losses, returning the system to its previous stable state” (Limnios et al., 2014, p. 105). Some scholars consider resilience as “bouncing back” from dis-ruptions (Holling, 1996; Holling & Gunderson, 2002), while others consider it as “bouncing forward” from adversity into a new, stronger, and more resourceful stable state (Carpenter et al., 2001; Folke et al., 2010). A process view instead considers resilience as a dynamic interaction between an organization and its environment, which is inevitably sha-ped by the nature of the disturbance and the behavior of the actors involved (Nadasdy, 2007). This process unfolds through the actions organizational actors take when they respond to an exogenous shock and gain new insights that feed back into their ongoing organizing ef-forts (Williams et al., 2017). This reflects an assumption about organi-zations as constantly evolving, and stability as moments of only temporary stasis that can change suddenly and become something profoundly different from before (Pike et al., 2010). When faced with exogenous shocks, organizations hardly ever return to where they were (Davoudi, 2012), and scholars in this view therefore decouple resilience from outcomes of organizational stability or growth because they see it as “a part of organizational healing that occurs after a crisis” (Hillmann & Guenther, 2021, p. 31). There is broad indication in the literature that organizational resilience processes typically emphasize pre-adversity organizing, the immediate shock response, situation-specific adapta-tions, and future-oriented transformations, in a non-linear fashion (Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011). In this way, resilience is not a fixed or universal attribute, but rather a dynamic response process that unfolds over time, as organizational actors take action, reflect on unexpected events and incorporate feedback from their actions into ongoing resil-ience efforts (Williams et al., 2017). A key point of contention between these two views is the “moment” where resilience can be observed (Williams et al., 2017). From an outcome point of view, building resilience is about the implementation of generic measures that are designed to absorb variations and maintain functions (Carpenter et al., 2001), but its outcome is observed as the moment where an organization returns to its equilibrium state after an exogenous shock (Holling, 1996; Holling & Gunderson, 2002). Mean-while, ample evidence suggests that response strategies are more effective when they are tailored to a specific shock and consider how its characteristics (such as its nature, cause, and complexity) interact with the specific characteristics of the organization (such as its structure, culture, and resource endowments). For example, an organization with strong financial resources may be better able to weather an economic downturn than one with limited financial resources, while an organi-zation with digital resources is better equipped for dealing with a communication and connectivity crisis than an organization without. Scholars taking the process view therefore question the claim that certain factors or conditions will lead to resilient (or non-resilient) outcomes because it fails to account for the dynamic nature of a response to exogenous shock (Linnenluecke, 2017). In lieu of trying to guarantee specific outcomes, they advocate more nuanced un-derstandings that recognize the role of agency and context (Pike et al., 2010) and underscore that resilience is about the resources and flexi-bility to respond to a wide range of threats and disruptions (Hillmann & Guenther, 2021). In the process view, the moment of organizational resilience therefore extends before exogenous shock (Williams et al., 2017), where already accumulated resources may shape the actions that organizational actors can take to enact an effective response. This, in turn, calls for careful attention to the role of resources, including the ways in which they can be accessed, mobilized and activated to enact specific response strategies with onset of exogenous shock (Linnen-luecke, 2017). However, the literature on organizational resilience gives no special credence to the role of digital resources, despite J.A. Nielsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               International Journal of Information Management 73 (2023) 1026873acknowledging their importance in responding to exogenous shock. 2.2. Resilience and digital resources While it is unsurprising that recent events of exogenous shock have spurred interest in resilience as a conceptual umbrella for trans-formation in the face of adversity, the IS literature attends mostly to resilience as outcome (Table 1). The prevailing rationale is that by studying how different entities use digital technologies to respond to shock, researchers and practitioners can identify factors and character-istics that impact resilience as well as best practices for building resil-ience capabilities, measure their effectiveness and suggest improvements (Heeks & Ospina, 2019). As such, the IS literature offers many insights into the different properties of resilient information sys-tems in the context of intrusion prevention, communication networks and cyberinfrastructure (Erol et al., 2010; Omer et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2011; Zobel & Khansa, 2012) and the impact of technology on generic resilience indicators, for example in increasing reliability (Salovaara et al., 2019), strengthening collaboration (Floetgen et al., 2021), reducing flexibility (Ignatiadis & Nandhakumar, 2007; Riolli & Savicki, 2003) and curbing long-term sustainability (Márton, 2021). Accordingly, the literature demonstrates that digital resources mat-ter for resilience, but how it matters is an open question. While the outcome view prevails in the IS literature (Heeks & Ospina, 2019), we know from the literature on organizational resilience that this view cannot adequately account for the important role played by agency and context (Pike et al., 2010; Davoudi, 2012). Moreover, we know that effective response strategies are tailored to the interactions between the specific characteristics of a shock and the organization. Recent work has made important contributions in this regard by demonstrating that specific characteristics of digital technology interact with different stages in the resilience process, for example through redundancy and sensing (for absorbing the initial shock), accessibility and experimen-tation (for adapting to situation-specific challenges), and scalability and reconfigurability (for transforming operations accordingly) (Boh et al., 2023). These advances pave the way to the cross-fertilization of insights elucidating the roles played by digital resources within different stages in the resilience process. Hence, to provide a granular understanding of how digital resources matter for resilience, we must not only account for the characteristics of the shock, of the organization, and of the digital resources involved, but also for how these characteristics interact and contribute to response strategies over time. Adopting a process view, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how resilience unfolds as organizational actors leverage digital re-sources to enact a specific response strategy during an exogenous shock. We know from previous IS process studies that the relationship between digital resources and resilience is complex and potentially fraught with tensions. Recent findings show that resilience evolves with long-term digitalization as “both the organizational challenge and its organizational and technological resolution” (Fleron et al., 2021, p. 2408), corroborating earlier insights that digital resources can simul-taneously enhance and inhibit resilience outcomes. Moreover, funda-mental tensions persist between short-term stability and long-term change (Cho et al., 2007; Heeks & Ospina, 2019), where the swift acti-vation of digital resources can offer much-needed capabilities to cope with a shock in the short term (Carugati et al., 2020; Park, 2023), while unravelling the social fabric of the organization in the long term (Orli-kowski & Scott, 2021; Tim, Cui, & Sheng, 2021). Hence, by attending to the actions through which organizational actors leverage digital re-sources in responding to a major exogenous shock, our aim is to advance knowledge on how digital resources shape organizational resilience as it evolves over time. 3. Research method 3.1. Study context To address our research question, we draw on an in-depth case study (Yin, 2009) of how the Faculty of Social Sciences at Aalborg University responded when, on Wednesday, March 11, 2020, the Danish govern-ment announced that physical activity in non-critical public-sector or-ganizations would be suspended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The faculty’s management decided to immediately shift all on-campus teaching to virtual delivery, with the result that educators had moved over to virtual formats a few days later (Haslam et al., 2021a). With this mandatory response, the faculty completed the spring semester with virtual teaching and avoided any major disruption of educational pro-grams, in line with how “most higher education institutions shut down their campuses and transitioned to emergency remote teaching” (Park, Son, & Angst, 2023). Hence, we examine how the university recovered from the suspension of physical teaching by shifting to virtual teaching through a process that unfolded between mid-March 2020 and June 2020. Our study focused on the teaching practices applied by a group of educators assisted by students, managers, and IT workers as its unit of analysis. This research design was based on the insight that an organi-zation can only be as resilient as its core groups of actors (Hillmann & Guenther, 2021). 3.2. Data collection Following Yin (2009), our data collection involved multiple sources (Table 2). First, we conducted 60 semi-structured interviews (Kvale, 2008) with educators (assistant, associate and full professors), students, managers, and IT personnel. Our first round of interviews took place in the initial weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown of March–April 2020 (30 interviews), with follow-up interviews with the same participants at the end of the semester, in June–July (30 interviews). We carried out all interviews online (Iacono, Symonds, & Brown, 2016) in the Danish language, using Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business. They lasted one hour, on average. We adapted the interview guide to the four stake-holder groups, covering four broad questions to all groups about the shift to virtual teaching: 1) How was teaching delivered prior to the pandemic? 2) Which teaching activities were transformed for virtual delivery, and how? 3) How were the consequences, challenges, and benefits of the shift to virtual teaching experienced? 4) How was the transformation into virtual teaching supported by digital resources? All interviews were recorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim, and all presented quotes were translated from Danish to English. Appendix A provides an English-language version of the interview protocol. Second, we included several document types. Because of the extreme situation, the faculty management emailed several announcements, procedure descriptions, and guidelines on virtual teaching to staff and students. We also had access to MS Teams forums where educators discussed virtual teaching. Among the additional data sources were a survey of educators (Appendix B) and a survey of students conducted at Table 1 IS studies of resilience.

Data analysis We conducted our data analysis in three iterative steps, progressing from focusing on the analysis of the empirical data towards conceptu-alization (Walsham, 2006). First, we familiarized ourselves with the full dataset by reading the interview transcripts, studying documents, and analyzing survey results. As is common in qualitative process studies, we observed that numerous storylines coexisted in the empirical data. On the one hand, particularly from a managerial perspective, our readings revealed the case to be a success story of accelerated digital trans-formation of teaching despite the pre-shock resistance to virtual teach-ing. On the other hand, educators and students were affected by the trials and tribulations of coping with a rapid shift to virtual teaching amid unexpected circumstances. They expressed numerous concerns related to the quality of the teaching and struggled to overcome the limitations of the virtual environment. This led us to zoom in on how educators, assisted by students, managers, and IT personnel, trans-formed the teaching practices by leveraging digital resources in response to the lockdown. Second, we relied on a digital resourcing perspective as a starting point and as our lens of analysis (Patton, 2002). Focused on the uni-versity’s core teaching task, we identified specific instances of how ac-tors “activated, combined, and recombined” digital resources (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007, p. 3418) and turned them into “resources-in-use” (Deken et al., 2018, p. 1923) to perform virtual teaching. In our coding process, we strove to make sense of how educators leveraged various digital re-sources and to identify opportunities and challenges in their virtual teaching. As we coded the student, manager, and IT-staff interviews for the individuals’ reflections on virtual teaching practices, we took notes to share our impressions and interpretations of the data, and we corroborated our interview-based findings with document reviews (Bowen, 2009). This coding provided two interrelated insights that became important for our conceptualization of digital resources in the organizational resilience process. First, we observed how educators, aided by the students, managers, and IT personnel, leveraged digital resources that had accumulated over time and thereby created a po-tential for a rapid shift to virtual teaching. Hence, in line with our process approach to resilience, we noticed how the past accumulation of digital resources was important for the organization’s response to the pandemic, which, in turn, situated the shock response in the context of the organization’s unfolding digitalization efforts. Second, we observed variations in how educators’ engagement with digital resources to shift to virtual teaching evolved over time as the situation changed from being rather chaotic in the weeks after the shock to becoming more ordered towards the end of the spring semester. Third, we used these insights in combination with temporal brack-eting techniques (Langley, 1999) to identify a pre-shock stage and three recovery stages—pivoting, adapting, and normalizing—in the organi-zational resilience process. Based on our coding of the empirical mate-rial, we then identified evidence about each stage (Appendix E). This evidence gave insights into how, in each stage of the shift to virtual teaching, educators, aided by the students, managers, and IT personnel, leveraged digital resources, revealing the different roles that digital re-sources played in recovering from the exogenous shock. Overall, these three iterative analytical steps helped us cycle back and forth between empirical evidence and conceptualization to compose a coherent storyline (Golden-Biddle & Locke, 2006) that explains how university stakeholders responded to the government-imposed lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic by shifting to virtual teaching. 4. Empirical analysis The Danish government’s announcement in March 2020 of a lock-down of all non-critical public-sector organizations to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus immediately affected all operations of the social-science faculty at Aalborg University. One associate professor recalled: “It was a shock Wednesday evening when I came downstairs after putting the kids to bed and discovered that I was not going to work at the university the next day.” The same evening, management decided that all teaching activities should shift to virtual delivery, to avoid disruption to teaching schedules and risks of delays in education pro-grams. The managers informed students, educators, and other staff members that they had only one day, Thursday, March 12, to collect their belongings from university buildings and that all teaching would be delivered virtually from Friday, March 13, onward. This early deci-sion to go virtual put digital resources at the front and center of the organizational resilience process. The dean explained: “Our teaching practices changed radically into virtual form between one day and the next.” The following account details how digital resources accumulated at the university before the shock and the role digital resources played throughout the recovery stages of pivoting to virtual teaching, adapting virtual teaching, and normalizing virtual teaching. 4.1. Pre-shock accumulation of digital resources Prior to the shock, the educators taught in an institutionalized, traditional way, predominantly engaging in conservative use of digital technologies during on-campus, in-class teaching with only sporadic attempts at virtual teaching. The dean explained that, irrespective of the increased management push for digitalization, attempts to introduce virtual teaching had “moved forward slowly,” weighed down by intense Table 2 Data collection overview.

International Journal of Information Management 73 (2023) 1026875discussion and “resistance to change” among educators and students alike. However, digital resources that could be used for virtual teaching had gradually accumulated in the organization, alongside various de-grees of using digital technology within and outside of teaching. While many of these resources were largely not recognized as valuable for virtual teaching by educators, managers, and students, they formed a basic infrastructure for organizational resilience whereby the university could, when required to do so, swiftly transform its work practices to a virtual format. Before the shock, various digital technologies were in use to support on-campus teaching: for activities related to study adminis-tration, education-connected communication, registration for exams, and more. Microsoft Outlook had also become the standard tool for email communications among educators and students, Skype for Busi-ness had been launched as the university’s internal communication platform for both calls and instant messaging, and, most educators had for years used digital technologies “in all sorts of ways as part of research” (associate professor). In their teaching, educators had widely adopted PowerPoint to structure lecture content, provide visual aids, and facilitate in-class discussion and assignments. As a full professor stated: “I always use PowerPoint to deliver my lectures and it is very integrated in my teaching practices.” Similarly, access to library materials had been digitalized many years earlier, and course materials were widely avail-able online as part of the university’s digital infrastructure. These de-velopments had culminated in the implementation, across the organization, of the learning-management system Moodle, which from 2010 onwards served as a common platform for coordinating courses, teaching materials, lecture information, assignments, and other ele-ments between educators and students. Moodle afforded augmenting physical learning environments and moving them entirely online, but, before the shock, educators and students utilized only basic functions such as those for course lists, calendars, and file-sharing to supplement on-campus teaching activities. Driven by various strategic initiatives for digitalization, the univer-sity had also invested in technologies such as Panopto, Mentimeter, Kahoot!, and Padlet that could directly support virtual teaching. To improve educators’ skill set and provide an incentive for the uptake of those technologies, managers had integrated virtual teaching and digital didactics into the curriculum of mandatory pedagogical education for junior faculty members. While these digital resources were readily available, only few educators actively experimented with virtual teaching prior to the pandemic. Hence, although some aspects of blended learning were adopted, “not much happened with virtual teaching before the COVID-19 pandemic” (digitalization-consultant). Notably, MS Teams—which became the most used virtual teaching platform at the faculty after the shock—was introduced at the university in 2017 as part of the MS Office 365 suite. An IT manager described it as having been “quietly introduced at the university, with only a few ed-ucators paying any attention.” Before the lockdown, managers and ed-ucators did not see MS Teams as a teaching technology, but as a collaboration tool for project teams and as a campus-wide telephone system that could replace Skype for Business. Hence, until the COVID-19 pandemic set in, digital resources had accumulated steadily over time. While no one before the pandemic had imagined that the university would shift fully to virtual teaching, many relevant digital resources were in place because of a long-term devel-opment toward a more digitalized university. Moreover, based on their own computers, coupled with good internet connections, the students had extensive experience of and advanced skills in using information technology for communication, computation, reporting, social media, information search, and more; thus, Aalborg University was woven into a strong infrastructure for virtual teaching by both the institution and by students. This accumulation of digital resources became important to understanding the university’s recovery from the exogenous shock caused by the pandemic. A department manager told us: “It was not about purchasing new technology but about using the ones we already had,” and the vice-dean added: “If this had happened five or ten years ago, we would never have been able to pull it off. Now, however, we had a multitude of IT systems and digital technologies, which were imme-diately available to everyone.” 4.2. Pivoting to virtual teaching Pivoting characterized the initial post-shock response, in which ed-ucators swiftly shifted to virtual teaching. The suspension of physical teaching delivery was experienced as dramatic by educators as they pivoted to find ways to teach virtually under conditions of uncertainty. In the immediate aftermath of the shock, they did their best to deliver teaching with readily available technologies and largely by using further functionality of the technologies they were already using. A full pro-fessor explained: “Many of the digital technologies have been available for quite a while, but you only really notice them when you are forced to seek them out.” Educators were under immense pressure to rapidly reestablish their practices in a virtual space, with one assistant professor characterizing the accelerated uptake of digital technologies as following a sponta-neous “trial-and-error approach.” One associate professor started, for example, to use the voiceover function of PowerPoint as she faced pressure to convert a two-day lecture-based seminar to a purely virtual format within a few days. She chose to structure her lectures into asynchronous voiceover sequences with slides, because this technique was “the easiest and most accessible.” Another associate professor noted: “Like many of my colleagues, I started using voiceover in PowerPoint. I always use PowerPoint in my teaching, but I had never used this feature before. I did not even know it existed.” In this way, educators took advantage of their experiences with well-established teaching technol-ogy (e.g., PowerPoint) and exploited functions that they had not pre-viously applied in teaching (e.g., slides with voiceover). Such changes in teaching practices were supported by IT personnel and managers who shortly after the lockdown prepared guides and tu-torials for virtual teaching. The digitalization consultant at the faculty stressed that she wanted to let educators and students know “that they were not alone, and we were doing everything we could to help them through this extreme situation.” As a case in point, a deputy department head circulated on March 12, only one day after the government lock-down was instated, a list of options for virtual teaching by e-mail to all educators, about which he stated: “I advise against synchronous teach-ing unless you have experience with that type of technology. The IT department also advises against it.1 If you do not want to use synchro-nous teaching, then there are good, simple asynchronous options with many benefits. I ask you to make your own decisions, depending on what will work for your teaching.” In describing the pivoting to virtual teaching, several educators referred to the experience as having “a steep learning curve” with sur-prises and setbacks. Preparing lectures involved devoting additional time to getting acquainted with new technology and to adjusting exist-ing material on the subject and topic outlines for a virtual format. One assistant professor was initially keen on trying out Panopto to pre-record his lectures as videos, but experienced so many technical issues that he gave up and resorted to PowerPoint: “I ended up making a PowerPoint with voiceover, but then I had to divide it into four different chunks to make it work because otherwise the file was too big. Actually, it prob-ably took at least a day just to redo the lecture that I had already prepared.” Moreover, experiences with otherwise well-known technologies such as PowerPoint in the physical space were not immediately reproducible in the virtual space. For instance, a full professor struggled to reestablish 1 The IT department advised against synchronous teaching at the start of the lockdown because it was unclear whether the existing technological bandwidth would suffice to support live-streaming for all lectures at the same time. J.A. Nielsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               International Journal of Information Management 73 (2023) 1026876himself as a lecturer with a virtual lecture’s pre-recorded form. Under normal circumstances, he used his 6′6″ physical stature and dry sense of humor to command the attention of his students. It turned out that this translated poorly to PowerPoint slides accompanied by an audio track. When recording his lectures at home, he therefore tried to emulate the lecture-hall experience, in hopes of projecting the same kind of energy: “I stood in the basement, in my children’s playroom, which has plenty of space, and I mounted my screen on top of the dollhouse. I know that if I sit down, my voice drops, so I closed my eyes and imagined I was standing in front of the students.” Where he normally would rely on “doing something awkward on purpose to break the ice” within the first 20 seconds from entering the room, he scrambled to find a good way to establish this practice with his invisible students. For a lecture on cul-tural history, he came up with an idea: he could use music matching the lecture topic as an icebreaker. Mimicking the style of a radio host, he began his lecture to the slowly fading tune of a tacky Danish pop song about summer and windy shores. He concluded, “When my students started playing that PowerPoint [presentation] they heard Birthe Kjær singing ‘Summer and Sunshine,’ I think I caught their attention.” In this way, he combined different digital resources (PowerPoint, music) with humor to create interest in the subject matter and to compensate for the lack of physical presence. Under normal circumstances, interacting with students in the class-room was highly valued as an integral part of the organization’s brand as a Problem Based Learning (PBL) university (Haslam et. al., 2021b). But in the hectic days immediately after the lockdown announcement, most educators accepted, albeit with unease, that they had to be pragmatic with the didactics involved: “I felt a little apologetic about the peda-gogical side of it, thinking, ‘Now it’s like this, it has to work, so I do the best I can’,” said one assistant professor. Another associate professor noted: “We have been pushing the boundaries of what can be done at such short notice. It works for now, but it is challenging and certainly not the same as physical teaching.” Although these educators were dissatisfied with the purely one-way communication offered by pre-recorded lectures, students seemed to accept the format in light of the unusual situation, with one remarking: “We are using a solution [voiceover in PowerPoint] that isn’t perfect, and there are probably better solutions out there. However, given the circumstances, what we are doing is fine right now.” Accordingly, events immediately after the shock triggered an unex-pected pivot to virtual teaching as the physical teaching practices were disrupted by the lockdown. During this fast-paced and hectic change, educators leveraged the digital resources available—asynchronous so-lutions such as PowerPoint with voiceover in particular—to facilitate the shift to virtual teaching. As an expression of organizational resil-ience, a department head described this process as one that “happened more painlessly than expected,” with very few teaching activities getting cancelled or postponed as educators handled the new situation via whatever digital resources were required to “get the teaching done.” 4.3. Adapting virtual teaching The rapid shift to virtual teaching was followed by a less hectic stage, described by the dean as follows: “After about 3–4 weeks, we entered a new stage, when it became more operational even though this was still an extraordinary situation.” That stage in the organizational resilience process was marked by deliberate efforts by the educators to adapt their virtual teaching to make the practices, which they had had to put together very quickly in the pivoting stage, more acceptable. In contrast to the previous stage, most educators chose not to continue to teach solely through pre-recorded lectures, but rather explored how to improve the quality of their teaching under the new circumstances. The initial relief and surprise that a shift to virtual teaching had been possible did not eclipse the most urgent concern among educators: that the asynchronous activities provided merely one-way communication. This worry motivated many educators to invest more efforts into using synchronous solutions based on technologies such as MS Teams, Zoom, Kahoot!, and Padlet to improve the interaction and dialogue with and between students. A few educators had experimented with synchronous live-streamed teaching from the very beginning of the lockdown, but it gained widespread uptake at this stage. To facilitate this adaptation in virtual teaching practices from asynchronous to synchronous formats, the faculty started offering courses on digital resource available for virtual teaching via MS Teams. Although MS Teams “before the lock-down never really was considered a teaching tool” (IT manager), it became the most used platform to stream lectures at the faculty (Ap-pendix B). Use of MS Teams skyrocketed from a pre-lockdown level of 3600 users at the university (in February 2020) to 17,000 users by May 2020 (Appendix D). Its adoption increased rapidly, thanks in part to the university already having MS Teams as part of the MS Office 365 suite and therefore being able to scale and diffuse it quickly. A key challenge for educators was to leverage digital resources to closely mimic their pre-shock experiences with on-campus teaching. By using MS Teams, and later Zoom,2 to stream lectures, educators attempted to replicate the physical classroom’s opportunities for dy-namic interaction with students—such as clicking through slides and taking ad hoc questions from them. Thus, how interaction usually played out in the physical classroom took center stage in how virtual lectures should best be conducted. However, as an associate professor reflected, much was contingent on the students turning on their camera: “I always have video on. And I think several of the students in the beginning did too, but then it quietly tapered off. I don’t know if it’s because people haven’t gotten out of bed, but I very easily lose sense of who is really paying attention and who is not.” In some situations, educators decided to abandon certain teaching methods in response to the perceived lim-itations with the virtual format. For example, in the social-work edu-cation program, educators usually relied on roleplay as part of their teaching practices to train budding social workers in how to facilitate communication on sensitive social issues. One educator stated that she decided to suspend roleplaying entirely because she had no idea of how to establish a safe environment that could support the intimacy of the learning experience in a virtual setting. In situations such as this one, the shift to virtual teaching continued to cause problems and frustrate educators. At this stage of the organizational resilience process, setbacks also led to continued adaptation of virtual teaching practices. This was particularly true for educators who began leveraging digital resources to combine asynchronous and synchronous activities. For example, instead of using MS Teams to transmit a full lecture in real time, some educators hosted shorter, joint discussion sessions as follow-up to pre-recorded lectures. In these, students could ask for clarification or engage in dia-logue with the educator and other students. One assistant professor explained: “I made small videos in Panopto based on my usual lecture and put them on Moodle so the students could find them there. A few days later, I had a live session in Teams where I asked whether anything was unclear and whether they needed help getting started on the assignment. There wasn’t really anyone who responded. So, I closed the live session after ten minutes and wrote to the students, ‘Fine, work on the assignment and write questions in the MS Teams channel.’ After a week, I recorded a new Panopto video where I answered these questions.” At first, this educator had intended to use Panopto, Moodle, and MS Teams to synthesize shorter pre-recorded videos with an assignment and a comprehensive discussion session. Yet, when confronted with students who engaged only minimally or not at all during the sessions, he was compelled to amend his approach to instead encourage students to pose 2 The university also decided to purchase an institutional license for Zoom, though one was not available until late April. Although Zoom was not the faculty’s preferred platform (Appendix B), it still reached 3000 users by the end of the semester (in June 2020). J.A. Nielsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               International Journal of Information Management 73 (2023) 1026877queries in the MS Teams channel, as questions occurred to them only during their engagement with the course material and working on the assignment. With his follow-up video recorded via Panopto, he then addressed these questions and distributed the video over Moodle. Although the lack of student participation was initially an issue in leveraging digital resources for organizational resilience, it led to the formation of a new virtual lecture format, enabled by a patchwork of digital resources. These efforts were facilitated by knowledge-sharing, which had become more widespread and formalized at this stage. While the faculty offered courses in the use of MS Teams (and later Zoom) from April onward, knowing which digital resources were suitable for virtual teaching relied mostly on educators seeking out and sharing experi-ences. Faculty leaders used MS Teams to create numerous Q&A forums, where educators shared insights pertaining to how to undertake specific teaching activities in the virtual space. On April 27th, an associate professor received 23 responses within 88 minutes to the following questions: “Anyone with experience organizing exercises for students online? Most advice and links seem to be about lectures, which is fine, but what about exercises?” Hence, underscoring the importance of ex-periences and skills in digital resources, getting to know how colleagues approached virtual teaching was critical for educators as they strived to improve the delivery of their teaching in virtual formats. Thus, in the second stage of the organizational resilience process, educators adapted virtual teaching practices by experimenting with live- streaming lectures, and combining asynchronous and synchronous teaching to support dialogue and interaction with students, which they previously had experienced as problematic. Educators used a wide range of technologies to integrate asynchronous and synchronous activities, and strived to improve virtual teaching through an emerging patchwork of digital resources. 4.4. Normalizing virtual teaching As the semester neared its end, virtual teaching became normalized as teaching practice at the faculty. Educators had leveraged digital re-sources to first pivot to and then gradually adapt to virtual teaching to recover from the exogenous shock and “virtual teaching had now become the new normal,” as one associate professor expressed it. A professor further explained that there was “such a steep learning curve in the beginning—a lot of energy, enthusiasm, and interest was mobilized to try something quite different—and then a kind of routine set in.” Even though the result was by no means equivalent to the institutionalized on-campus, in-class teaching prior to the shock, edu-cators’ practices eventually fell into two distinct patterns: live-streamed lectures of shorter-than-normal duration and pre-recorded videos sup-plemented by written assignments or online discussion-seminar ses-sions. While there were variations in the duration of live streams and pre-recorded videos, and while written assignments were mandatory in some cases but voluntary in others, both patterns normalized in recovering from the shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this third stage of the organizational resilience process, discus-sions about the long-term impact of the COVID pandemic started to surface. Some educators saw new opportunities to developing teaching practices, as experiences with virtual teaching had made them under-stand how digital resources could be used to meaningfully transcend established lecture formats. As a full professor speculated: “There are some courses where we could use a stock of recordings. Columbus still discovers America in the same year, so it doesn’t change very much from semester to semester.” Others found meaning in written assignments that had originally been meant as a substitute for general synthesizing discussions, as an assistant professor noted: “They had to write two pages for me, and that counted as active participation. It actually worked well. It was nice for me to get that feedback from the students.” As such, experiences with virtual teaching began to challenge previously taken-for-granted assumptions about teaching. One associate professor reflected on how now-collapsed structures had previously constrained her ability to experiment with new lecture formats: “There is something about the structures. When we plan the semesters, the secretaries automatically book 90-minute slots in auditoriums … It’s as if that structure dictates that we need to have standard lecture formats. I tried to say, ‘Well, can I not just get a 45-minute lecture?’ but met with resistance. It is more flexible in virtual format.” However, educators had different perceptions about the opportu-nities and challenges of virtual teaching. As the spring semester ended, the immediate onset of the shock receded into the background and critical voices were increasingly raised against virtual teaching. Though educators had successfully shifted to virtual teaching in response to the lockdown, what one assistant professor called the “wow effect” dissi-pated. Dialogue and fluid interactions between educators and students were perceived as significantly more challenging in the virtual setting, as an associate professor noted: “Although breakout rooms and Teams channels can do a lot, the good exchange and reflection from a physical classroom easily disappears in the stark technological environment of virtual teaching.” Student experiences with virtual teaching were like-wise mixed. Although students reported positive learning experiences, the majority still preferred physical teaching, as the survey results attested (Appendix C). Yet, many students valued pre-recorded lectures and saw them as ideal in preparing for tests. A graduate student explained: “I’ve taken two exams, where we could use this pre-recorded material. The fact that you can go back to it is fantastic. It has really helped me a lot if there was something that I had to recall from the lecture when studying for the exam.” Hence, this stage of the resilience process reveals how virtual teaching was normalized to the point where critical debate about its opportunities and challenges took center stage. Still, bringing digital resources into use and change teaching practices when needed, had been crucial for educators as they recovered from the shock. While the initial focus was on pivoting and adapting to the available digital resources, it had now moved to assessing the organizational resilience experience as part of shaping the university’s future use of digital resources for teaching as stated by the vice dean: “In this semester we tried out different technologies and approaches for virtual teaching and improved some things. As we have been through that stage, we can now focus more on increasing teaching quality going forward.” 5. Discussion Our study extends emerging scholarly work by applying a process view of organizational resilience (Linnenluecke, 2017; Tim, Cui, & Sheng, 2021; Williams, Gruber, Sutcliffe, Shepherd, & Zhao, 2017) to investigate the under-explored role of digital resources in shaping the process. Drawing on a digital resourcing perspective (Deken et al., 2018; Feldman, 2004; Linnenluecke, 2017), we analyzed how teaching at Aalborg University shifted to a virtual format in response to the government-imposed lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the one hand, we were fascinated by how educators, assisted by students, managers, and IT personnel, swiftly leveraged digital resources to form new teaching practices amid an exogenous shock. On the other hand, the organizational resilience process was far from straightforward, but loaded with challenges and lurking tensions as virtual teaching practices changed and became more normalized during the 2020 spring semester. In the following, we draw on the findings from this case study to discuss our empirical and theoretical contributions to the literature on organi-zational resilience and digital resources, and the implications of our contributions to theory and practice. 5.1. Organizational resilience and digital resources As visualized in Fig. 1, our empirical analysis reveals how the organizational resilience process unfolded as educators pivoted, adapt-ed, and normalized into teaching virtually in response to an exogenous J.A. Nielsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               International Journal of Information Management 73 (2023) 1026878shock that made on-campus teaching impossible. In this process of going virtual, digital resources were crucial and took on specific roles across the three stages as the resilience process propelled the organization forward from the pre-shock accumulation of digital resources to a new status quo, which became the basis for its continued digitalization ef-forts. While the identified stages differ in focus, they are closely inter-related and together they represent how actors, in the course of the organizational resilience process, continuously interacted with the environment to leverage digital resources (Williams et al., 2017). Pivoting refers to the stage immediately after the shock were edu-cators spontaneously leveraged digital resources to continue teaching during the government-imposed lockdown. Educators were quick to go virtual by leveraging readily available digital resources, thereby avoiding disruption in the quickest and easiest way possible, for example, using PowerPoint’s voice-over functionality to pre-record and distribute lectures. This response, which entailed an immediate change in how teaching was performed, was neither planned nor particularly strategic, but resonates with recent findings clarifying how entering “survival mode” leads actors to keep risks as low as possible by seizing digital resources to replicate preexisting practices in the new environ-ment (Carugati et al., 2020). Hence, as going virtual was the recovery strategy at the university, pivoting captures how select pre-shock accumulated digital resources were activated to keep functioning amid the exogenous shock (Linnenluecke, 2017). Adapting is the stage in which educators moved away from “survival mode” and deliberately adapted virtual teaching practices to make them more acceptable. While educators were quick to embrace PowerPoint with voiceover, they soon ascertained that pre-recorded lectures could not afford the immediate interaction with and feedback from students that were integral to their pre-pandemic teaching practices. Such con-cerns led educators to seek ways to improve virtual teaching and engage with more interactive approaches, for example, by adopting MS Teams, Zoom, and other tools and by developing an amalgam of lecture videos, voiceover recordings, live-streaming, and written assignments. This insight unveils how educators moved the resilience process forward by adapting the emergency teaching practices to turn setbacks into mean-ingful input (Bechky & Okhuysen, 2011). While the pivoting stage was chaotic and characterized by the spontaneous use of readily available resources, the adapting stage was more reflective with deliberative ef-forts to form “revised, novel, or alternative practices” (Orlikowski & Scott, 2021, p. 5) that were more acceptable for the actors involved. As a result, the educators widened their digital option repertoire (Sandberg et al., 2014) by starting to integrate asynchronous and synchronous technologies to improve virtual teaching. Normalizing describes the stage wherein educators at the end of the 2020 spring semester described virtual teaching as “a new normal,” representing how teaching practices—in a relatively short time-frame—had undergone a fundamental transition. Once the educators experienced virtual teaching as acceptable, their orientation shifted from shock response to applying virtual teaching with increasing routinization, but also with individual reflections and growing debate over the challenges of virtual teaching. These depictions are in line with recent research indicating that the final stage of resilience is not one of returning to some pre-shock state, but one of moving towards a new status quo (Williams et al., 2017). Our insights pertaining to the normalization stage therefore cast the “new normal” (Carroll & Conboy, 2020) in a different light, underscoring that the university’s recovery cannot reasonably be equated to bouncing back to previous teaching practices, but rather as moving forward towards new practices, sup-porting a process-based rather than an equilibrium-based view of organizational resilience. Based on these insights, we suggest the following: Proposition 1. In response to exogeneous shock, an organization can progress through stages of pivoting, adapting and normalizing into digitally transformed work practices, where pivoting involves un-planned activation of available digital resources, adapting involves deliberate adaptation of the emerging digitalized practices, and normalizing involves moving forward towards new digitalized practices. Our findings also show that digital resources took on different roles across the three stages during which the university responded to the exogenous shock by going virtual. During pivoting, digital resources enabled a swift transition to virtual teaching reflecting how the uni-versity initially absorbed the shock to keep functioning by activating readily available resources (Vogus & Sutcliffe, 2007). In this process, educators immediately turned select digital resources into resources-in-use (Deken et al., 2018) and relied on their experiences and skills in using digital technologies from before the pandemic to get their teaching done when on-campus teaching became impossible due to the lockdown. During adapting, digital resources offered flexibility towards acceptable teaching practices as educators learned from their initial responses to turn their virtual teaching experiences and skills into more acceptable teaching practices (Williams et al., 2017). Hence, digital resources were adapted to emerging situation-specific challenges (Boh et al., 2023), emphasizing their malleable attributes in use (Melville et al., 2004; Kallinikos et al., 2013). Finally, during normalizing, which involved a critical discussion of the opportunities and challenges of virtual teaching, digital resources made new digital options for teaching actionable (Sandberg et al., 2014) thereby laying a foundation for future-oriented transformations (Lengnick-Hall et al., 2011). While most university settings have returned to in-person, on-campus teaching of the type that was dominant before the lockdown, the intensive use of virtual teaching during lockdown offered the university thorough in-sights into different options for integrating (or not integrating) virtual teaching into future teaching practices (Rapanta et al., 2021). Accord-ingly, we suggest the following: Fig. 1. : Leveraging digital resources to shift to virtual teaching in response to an exogenous shock.  J.A. Nielsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               International Journal of Information Management 73 (2023) 1026879Proposition 2. Digital resources play different roles in responding to exogeneous shock across the stages of organizational resilience: during pivoting, digital resources enable swift transformation into digitalized work practices that allow for continued operation; during adaptation, digital resources offer flexibility that support developing more accept-able digitalized practices; and, during normalizing, digital resources make new digital options actionable that support continued digitaliza-tion efforts. Overall then, the university’s response to the exogenous shock became intertwined with the unfolding digitalization efforts. Though organizational resilience is post-shock-oriented (Williams et al., 2017), the response at the univer
