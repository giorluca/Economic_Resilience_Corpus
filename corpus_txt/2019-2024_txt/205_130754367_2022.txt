Given that not every species can be studied in detail, it is importantto understand the extent to which climate adaptation patterns can be generalised across species,in terms of the selective agents and traits involved. We here compare patterns of genetic-basedpopulation (co)variation in leaf economic and hydraulic traits, climate–trait associations, and genomicdifferentiation of two widespread tree species (Eucalyptus pauciflora and E. ovata). We studied 2-year-old trees growing in a common-garden trial established with progeny from populations of bothspecies, pair-sampled from 22 localities across their overlapping native distribution in Tasmania,Australia. Despite originating from the same climatic gradients, the species differed in their levels ofpopulation variance and trait covariance, patterns of population variation within each species wereuncorrelated, and the species had different climate–trait associations. Further, the pattern of genomicdifferentiation among populations was uncorrelated between species, and population differentiationin leaf traits was mostly uncorrelated with genomic differentiation. We discuss hypotheses toexplain this decoupling of patterns and propose that the choice of seed provenances for climate-based plantings needs to account for multiple dimensions of climate change unless species-specificinformation is available.Keywords: assisted migration; climate adaptation; Eucalyptus; hydraulic traits; leaf traits; provenancingstrategies; seed-sourcing; parallel evolution1. IntroductionAnthropogenic acceleration of global climate change raises key questions regarding thecapacity of native plant species to withstand or adapt to such change [1,2]. Tree species areof particular concern due to their longevity, often poor dispersal capacity, role as foundationspecies in many terrestrial ecosystems, as well as their importance in ecological renovation(sensu [3]) and global carbon sequestration [1,4]. Developing an understanding of adaptivecapacity of tree populations can guide intervention strategies to facilitate their adaptationand resilience in the face of climate change [5–9]. An increasing body of research has begunto characterise adaptive variation within tree species related to climate [5,7,10–12]. Suchstudies aim to develop a predictive understanding of climate adaptation, and ultimatelyPlants 2022, 11, 1846. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants11141846 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plantsPlants 2022, 11, 1846 2 of 29heuristic guidelines that managers can use to guide seed-source (provenance) choices forforestry and ecological renovation. In particular, the choice of species and provenancesmay be guided by the characteristics of the home-site climate and covariation of functionaltraits with climate. Developing such heuristics requires empirical data on climate/traitassociations across suites of species with differing characteristics.The extent to which the patterns of adaptive variation in functional traits are pre-dictable from niche differences is a key question in evolutionary biology, and underliesstudies of parallel/convergent evolution at the species and population levels [13–16]. Re-peated genetic-based patterns of trait variation in independent populations occupyingsimilar environments is strong evidence for the influence of natural selection, as the sametrait-environment associations are unlikely to repeatedly arise through neutral processessuch as drift and mutation [13,17]. However, empirical studies addressing this issue withinspecies often report a continuum in ‘parallel and nonparallel’ (or ‘shared and unique’)patterns of trait divergence [16,18,19]. Further, the specific functional traits exhibitingpopulation divergence may not be as anticipated, with reported cases of both adaptivedifferentiation and evolutionary stasis reported [4,20].Differences in the patterns of (co)variance among traits will reflect different patternsand processes of trait integration (e.g., developmental, functional, genetic, and evolutionaryintegration) that may occur at multiple levels (species, populations within species, or indi-viduals within populations) [21,22]. In addition, environmental gradients may confounddifferent selective forces (e.g., aridity gradients can involve covarying temperature andprecipitation [23]). This can lead to ‘hidden’ selection [13,19,24], further complicating thepredictability of the trajectory of phenotypic evolution in response to climate change. Nev-ertheless, there are many empirical studies revealing broad patterns of parallel/convergentevolution and multitrait coordination within animal (e.g., [19,25]) and plant (e.g., [11,26])species. Adaptive syndromes are often hypothesised [4,27–29], which combined with theempirical findings provides impetus for the goal of predicting adaptive phenotypes forfuture climates [4,26].In addition to life-history traits [30], a predictive understanding of climate adaptationalso requires consideration of different groups of functional traits. In plants, multipletraits are known to affect performance and stress adaptation, including leaf economicand hydraulic traits. Leaf economic traits have been shown to affect resource allocationstrategies with various trait combinations hypothesised to reflect different returns on theinvestment in nutrients and dry mass in leaves, which includes a continuum from specieswith competitive (‘fast species’) to conservative (‘slow species’) growth strategies [27,31].Leaves of ‘slow species’ are often more sclerotic and are expected to have longer lifespansand higher survival in the face of abiotic and biotic stress [29,32]. The leaf hydraulic traitssuch as stomatal and vein density affect leaf gas exchange (e.g., CO2 uptake) and watertransfer [33,34], with higher densities promoting faster growth.Emerging empirical evidence shows little support for coordination between leaf eco-nomic and hydraulic traits [33,35]. Rather, accumulating evidence suggests differenttraits provide different adaptation opportunities, resulting in a wide diversity of adapta-tion options through differential combinations of traits [36,37]. However, functional trait(co)variation and trait-climate associations may change with scale [32,38]. Most theoreti-cal and empirical studies involving the leaf economic and hydraulic traits have focusedon higher-level community or species level associations (e.g., [29,31,39]). In trees, atten-tion is increasingly shifting to associations at the intra-specific level [40–42], particularlythe genetic-based differences and associations between populations [35,43] that provideinsights into micro-evolutionary responses to climate variation [44].The present study used a common-garden experiment to compare variation in growthperformance, leaf economic, and leaf hydraulic traits from populations of two widespreadeucalypt species, Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieber ex Spreng. and E. ovata Labill., native tothe island of Tasmania, Australia. As we were interested in a direct comparison of thetwo species where they experience the same climate gradient(s), we focused our studyPlants 2022, 11, 1846 3 of 29on a set of 22 paired populations from the overlapping geographic range of these species.We specifically aimed to compare species in terms of their patterns of: (i) genetic-basedpopulation variation and covariation in leaf traits; (ii) climate-trait associations of leaf traits;and (iii) genomic differentiation among populations. We hypothesised that:(a) the two species will share similar patterns of trait (co)variation and trait–climaterelationships owing to their co-occurrence in a common climate landscape;(b) leaf economic and leaf hydraulic traits will have different axes of variation withinspecies, consistent with emerging patterns of variation between species [33,35];(c) trends in leaf economic and hydraulic traits will reflect expectations for adaptationsto climate.2. Results2.1. Climate LandscapeOur samples of the 2 species did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) in altitude or inthe 10 climatic variables studied (Table S1), and the average correlation among co-locatedspecies populations for the 10 climatic variables was 0.97 (range 0.95–1.00). From this weconcluded that the sampled populations of both species were from the same (macro)climatelandscape and experienced the same climate gradient(s), which was the intent of our pairedsampling design.2.2. Species Trait DifferencesWhen the populations sampled were grown in a common garden, the two speciesexhibited highly significant (p < 0.001) differences in growth performance measures, as wellas in most leaf economic and hydraulic traits (Table 1). These species differences reflecteda marked, genetic-based difference in growth strategies. The greater growth rate (heightand stem diameter) and higher leaf SLA of E. ovata (mainly due to its thinner leaves) wasconsistent with a less conservative growth strategy compared with E. pauciflora. On average,the leaves of E. ovata also had a greater density of stomata and veins (at p < 0.001, in bothcases) compared to the leaves of E. pauciflora. However, the stomata of E. pauciflora werelarger than those of E. ovata (p < 0.001), on average, resulting in no statistically significantdifference between the species in the total stomata length per unit leaf area (p > 0.05).Table 1.

Population VariationNo statistically significant among-population variance (p > 0.05) in performance traitswas detected at two years of age within either species in the fitted linear mixed models (butsee relationships with climate of origin, below) (Table 2). In contrast, among-populationvariance was significant at the 5% nominal level for five of eight leaf traits in E. pauciflora,and three of eight leaf traits in E. ovata (Table 2). While more leaf traits exhibited significantamong-population variance in E. pauciflora than in E. ovata, variance homogeneity testsindicated that differences between species in population variances were only statisticallysignificant for leaf area (p < 0.01) and leaf thickness (p < 0.05). The compound traits SLA andstomata length per area were the only traits that exhibited significant population variance(p < 0.05) in both species.Table 2.

In particular, even for the traits where population variance wasdetected to be statistically significant in both species (i.e., SLA and stomata length per area),Plants 2022, 11, 1846 5 of 29we found no significant correlations (p > 0.05) among the paired population means of thetwo species.The greater significance of the genetic-based population variability in leaf traits in E.pauciflora than in E. ovata was confirmed at the multivariate level (Table 3). Using the set ofprimary economic (leaf area, thickness, and density) and hydraulic (stomata density, stom-ata length, and vein density) traits, MANOVA showed marginal nonsignificant generalizedvariance among populations in E. ovata (p = 0.081), but this was highly significant in E.pauciflora (p < 0.001). The species difference was mainly driven by the leaf economic traits,for which the generalized variance among populations was highly significant in E. pauci-flora (p < 0.001) but not significant in E. ovata (p = 0.333). While the species difference wasclearly weaker, the reverse trend was evident for the hydraulic traits where the generalizedvariance of E. ovata populations was marginally significant (p = 0.021) but not significant inE. pauciflora (p = 0.152). Thus, in the same landscape, this finding indicates that suites ofprimary leaf traits are contributing differently to genetic-based population differentiation inthe two species (Table 3), which is also consistent with the results on intra-class correlationsestimated for individual traits (Table 2).Table 3.

Correlations among TraitsWithin species, the population means of the three primary leaf economic traits were notstatistically significantly correlated at the 5% nominal level (Table 4). In contrast, while mostcombinations of the three primary hydraulic traits were statistically uncorrelated withinspecies, population-mean vein density and stomata density were positively correlated in E.ovata (r = 0.55, p < 0.01), signalling some coordination of hydraulic traits with respect to gasexchange and photosynthesis. In both species, there was also a statistically nonsignificanttrend at the population level for high stomata density to be associated with low stomata size.Population means in the composite traits—SLA and stomata length per unit area—wereoften highly significantly (p < 0.001) correlated with one or other of their componentprimary traits in a consistent manner in both species (Table 4). For example, increasesin population mean SLA were mainly associated with reduced leaf thickness (r < −0.8;p < 0.001) and reduced leaf density (r < −0.6; p < 0.001), but not significantly correlated withleaf area. This indicates that it is the population differences in leaf density, and particularlyin leaf thickness, which underlies the population differences in SLA.There were only a few significant correlations within species reflecting population-level covariation of an economic trait with a hydraulic trait (Table 4). Several of thesecorrelations were notable, as they involved opposite or different patterns of covariationamong population means in the two species. For example, thicker-leaved populationsof E. ovata tended to have a greater length of stomata per unit area (r = 0.44, p < 0.05),meaning more potential for gas exchange but also water loss, whereas the opposite wasthe case in E. pauciflora (r = −0.53, p < 0.01), indicating thinner-leaved populations havemore potential for gas exchange and water loss. These associations did not transfer toa significant correlation with SLA in E. ovata but did in E. pauciflora where populationswith leaves with higher mean SLA tended to have a greater length of stomata per unitarea (r = 0.51, p < 0.05), mainly due to their greater stomata density (r = 0.45, p < 0.05).Thus, across the same climate landscape, not only do the species differ in their patterns ofPlants 2022, 11, 1846 6 of 29univariate (Table 2) or multivariate population variability (Table 3), but also in the patternof covariation among traits within species (Table 4).Table 4.

Comparisons of Molecular and Quantitative Differentiation among PopulationsThe significant population differentiation detected in quantitative traits in the twospecies was also evident in molecular data where low, but significant, genome-wide SNPdifferentiation (FST) was detected among the populations sampled within both species.While based on different genome-wide SNP sets, the overall FST among the E. pauciflorapopulations (21 populations; FST = 0.030, 95% CI 0.026–0.033; based on 3603 DARTseqmarkers) was significantly higher than that among the E. ovata populations (21 populations;FST = 0.013, 95% CI 0.011–0.015; based on 22,708 Euc72K chip markers), consistent with itsgreater population differentiation in leaf traits. A slightly lower, but significant overall FSTfor E. pauciflora, was also obtained using the 10 putative neutral microsatellite loci assayedby Gauli et al. [45] (21 populations; FST = 0.024, 95% CI 0.017–0.032). These data werefrom the same E. pauciflora trees as assayed for SNPs, and the pairwise FST values weresignificantly positively correlated at the population level (Spearman Mantel correlation,rho = 0.55, p = 0.003).The discordant patterns of population variation between species observed in leaffunctional traits also extended to the genomic level, where there was no significant as-sociation of the patterns of population differentiation in the co-occurring E. ovata and E.pauciflora populations. The Mantel correlation of the matrices of pairwise SNP-derivedFST values among populations of the two species (linked by their geographically pairedpopulations) was not significantly different from zero (Table 5). The equivalent matricesof generalised distances calculated from various groupings of quantitative traits for eachspecies were similarly uncorrelated between E. ovata and E. pauciflora (Table 5), consistentwith the absence of significant correlations among population means of the species for theleaf traits at the univariate level (Table 2). This independence of the multivariate patterns ofPlants 2022, 11, 1846 7 of 29pairwise population differentiation in quantitative traits was evident regardless of whetherthe primary hydraulic, economic, or all traits were compared. Focusing on the populationdifferences for the trait types that were significant in the MANOVA (Table 3), we found nosignificant correlation between the generalised distance matrix calculated among the popu-lations based on leaf hydraulic traits for E. ovata and leaf economic traits for E. pauciflora,arguing against the species showing parallel but alternative adaptation strategies.Table 5.

Results of between- and within-species matrix comparisons are provided.

Thiswas similarly the case for the hydraulic traits in E. ovata, which were also significantlydifferent among populations (Table 3). However, in E. ovata there was a significant Mantelcorrelation between the pairwise FST values and the nonsignificant (as suggested by theresults of Table 3) generalised distances based on the primary leaf economic traits (Table 5),raising the possibility that neutral population processes have contributed to the observedvariation among populations, which was statistically insignificant at the univariate (Table 2)and multivariate (Table 3) levels. However, we argue that differentiation in the leaf economictraits is still likely to reflect a weak underlying adaptive signal, because leaf economic traitsin E. ovata were substantially and significantly related to climate (see below) despite lack ofstatistical significance detected for the among-population variation.2.6. Discriminant Analysis and Projections of Home-Site Climate VectorsDiscriminant analysis showed different trait-based patterns of variation among pop-ulations in E. ovata compared with E. pauciflora (Figure 1; Procrustean r = 0.210, p = 0.658,for the two-dimensional result). In E. ovata, population differentiation in leaf traits wasmarginally nonsignificant (p ≤ 0.1) on the first maximum variance axis (LD1 42.4%,p = 0.081; LD2 21.8%, p = 0.690), whereas in E. pauciflora statistically significant differ-entiation occurred in two independent directions (LD1 42%, p < 0.001, and LD2 23.4%,p = 0.045) (Figure 1).Figure 1. Plots of population centroids in the space defined by the first two axes (LD1 and LD2)derived from separate discriminant analyses of the 22 paired populations of E. ovata ((a): LD1 42.4%,p = 0.081; LD2 21.8%, p = 0.690) and E. pauciflora ((b): LD1 42.0%, p < 0.001; LD2 23.4%, p = 0.045).The discriminant analyses were based on the six primary leaf economic and hydraulic traits, and theresulting LD axes are independent maximum variance axes. The direction of trait (primary and com-pound traits) and climate vectors which showed a significant (p < 0.05) fit into the two-dimensionaldiscriminant space are indicated (See Table S2). The length of each arrow is proportional to thecorrelation between the ordination and the trait/climatic variable, and the direction of each arrow isthe direction of its most rapid change [46]. The population codes (1-22) correspond to the spatiallypaired populations as detailed in Table S3.There were similarities and differences between species in the relationships betweenclimate and traits in the discriminant space defined by the leaf traits. In E. ovata, thePlants 2022, 11, 1846 9 of 29two-dimensional discriminant space was most closely aligned with three temperaturevectors, particularly maximum temperature (TMXWW, R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001), opposedweakly by precipitation (lnRANN, R2 = 0.28, p = 0.042) and the moisture index (MIH,R2 = 0.28, p = 0.040) (Figure 1, Table S2). The vectors for stomata density (R2 = 0.96,p < 0.001) and SLA (R2 = 0.92, p < 0.001) had the best fit (Table S2).In E. pauciflora, vector fitting similarly revealed an alignment of the discriminant spacewith maximum temperature (TMXWW, R2 = 0.30, p = 0.034), but this was weaker andoriented differently compared with the trend in E. ovata. Further, precipitation seasonalitywas significantly associated with population variation in the two-dimensional discriminantspace for E. pauciflora (lnRCVAR, R2 = 0.42, p = 0.007), compared with a correspondingstatistically nonsignificant result for E. ovata (R2 = 0.15, p = 0.215). For E. pauciflora, vectorsfor specific leaf area (R2 = 0.82, p < 0.001) and leaf thickness (R2 = 0.86, p < 0.001) had thebest fit to the discriminant space (Table S2).2.7. Univariate Climate-Trait AssociationsFurther evidence that patterns of leaf trait variation in the two species are aligned withdifferent facets of climate variation in the common landscape comes from the modelling ofclimate-trait associations using multiple linear regression analyses (Table 6). In contrast toanalyses that showed higher overall trait-based population differentiation (Tables 2 and 3)and higher FST in E. pauciflora than E. ovata, E. ovata showed stronger relationships betweenpopulation trait means and climate variables than E. pauciflora (8 versus 4 significant modelsfor the 10 performance and leaf traits, Table 6).The best regression models for E. ovata showed a clear pattern of greater SLA, lowerleaf thickness and density, and denser and smaller stomata with increasing home-sitemaximum temperature (TMXWW) and, in some cases, with lower home-site precipitationseasonality (lnRCVAR) (Tables 6 and S4, Figure 2). These trait patterns concurred closelywith growth performance trends in E. ovata, with maximum height and stem diameter alsoincreasing with home-site maximum temperature (TMXWW) (and mean annual precipita-tion, lnRANN) and declining with home-site precipitation seasonality (lnRCVAR) (Table 6,Figure S1). Other trends included increasing vein density with home-site temperature(TANN), as well as increasing stomatal density with home-site wettest quarter temperature(TWETQ) and precipitation seasonality (lnRCVAR). These patterns are largely consistentwith expectations of a less conservative growth strategy [47–49] and concur with the dis-criminant analysis, apart from a nonsignificant correlation with precipitation seasonality inthe discriminant analysis.Best climate-trait regression models for E. pauciflora concurred with E. ovata models insuggesting a significant increase in SLA and lower leaf thickness with increasing home-sitemaximum temperature (TMXWW) (Table 6, Figure 2). This was consistent with a rolefor maximum temperature more generally on the E. pauciflora discriminant analysis, andpotentially aligned with a marginally nonsignificant (p = 0.086) increase in height withhome-site temperature (TANN) (Table 6, Figure S1). On the other hand, most other aspectsof the E. pauciflora best regression models differed from those for E. ovata. This includes anincrease in SLA and decrease in leaf thickness with increasing moisture index of the wettestperiod (MIH) not detected in E. ovata, and an opposing relationship with precipitationseasonality (unexpectedly, SLA increased and leaf thickness decreased with increasinglnRCVAR) compared with the trend in E. ovata (Table 6, Figure 2). Further, stomatal traitsshowed stronger relationships with precipitation-related variables in E. pauciflora comparedwith a stronger relationship with temperature variables in E. ovata, again consistent withthe discriminant analysis (Figure 1). These included increased stomatal density withhigher home-site seasonality (lnRCVAR) and precipitation (lnRANN) (countered by lowerprecipitation in the driest week, lnRDRYW), and higher stomatal length per unit area withhome-site aridity (temperature in the driest quarter, TDRYQ) (Table 6, Figure 3).Plants 2022, 11, 1846 10 of 29Table 6.

DiscussionWe hypothesised that our two co-occurring study species would demonstrate similarpatterns of trait variation and trait–climate relationships owing to their shared distributionsubject to the same macro-climate gradients. Our common-garden study revealed onlyweak support for this hypothesis, and instead revealed strongly disparate patterns ofgenetic-based population variation and different climate–trait associations between E. ovataand E. pauciflora. Even when statistically significant population differentiation in leaf traitswas detected in both species, the spatial patterns of population variation were: (i) notcorrelated between species; (ii) usually associated with different facets of the variation inclimate; and (iii) generally independent of the patterns of genomic differentiation.Such decoupling of the patterns of population variation in functional traits in thesetwo co-occurring eucalypts contrasts with previous reports of parallel patterns of in situpopulation variation in co-occurring eucalypt species. These include clines in foliar leafwaxiness (glaucousness) on several Tasmanian mountains [50], as well as leaf functionaland physiological trait variation along a precipitation gradient on mainland Australia [51].There are few similarly paired common-garden studies of trees with which to compare ourstudy. A conceptually similar study is that of Vitasse et al. [52] involving common-gardencomparisons of provenances of six co-occurring species sampled along altitudinal gradientsin two valleys in the Pyrenees. While many traits showed parallel altitudinal/temperatureclines, importantly they did find opposing clines signalling different relationships amongtraits and fitness components in different species (see also [53]). Similarly, in common-garden experiments, the diversity among northern hemisphere tree species in the slopesof clines in leafing phenology with home-site altitude and latitude is evident in reviewsby Salk [54] and Alberto et al. [5]. Even within the same species, common-garden trialshave demonstrated differing patterns of population differentiation with respect to the sameenvironmental gradient [55]. Further, species-level studies focusing on measurements insitu or in glasshouse studies (rather than in common gardens) have similarly suggestedthat mechanisms for adaptation to climate can differ between congeneric species along thesame climate gradient or in response to the same stressors [56–58].3.1. Potential Drivers of Disparate Patterns between SpeciesHistorical, genetic, or ecological factors may explain our observed decoupling ofpatterns of population variation within co-occurring species. First, it is possible thatthe population differentiation observed largely reflects neutral processes through geneticdrift in small populations or different historical migration patterns. However, as thetwo species are widespread throughout Tasmania and are likely to have been subject tosimilar distributional changes during and following the last Pleistocene glaciation of theisland [59], we expected a positive association of patterns of population variation. Further,the Tasmanian populations of both species exhibit very low differentiation in SNP andmicrosatellite markers [60] (reports of species-wide FST values include: microsatellites—amean value for Australian tree species of 0.13 ± 0.01 [61]; SNPs—0.04 and 0.06 for E.marginata and E. globulus, respectively [62,63]). On average, these marker types are generallyexpected to reflect neutral variation [60], suggesting that neutral population processesare unlikely to have shaped the contemporary patterns of population differentiation offunctional traits. Our sampling design did not allow direct estimation of narrow-senseheritabilities to link our estimates of inter-population variability in functional traits based onthe intra-class correlation coefficients (Table 2) to the QST measure of population divergence,that is comparable to the genetic differentiation at putative neutral molecular markersmeasured by the FST [60]. However, following Leinonen et al. [64], if we conservativelyassume heritabilities of 0.5 and 1, the estimated QST for our traits showing statisticalsignificance would be two to nine times greater than the 95% upper confidence limit of theFST estimate (based on the microsatellite estimates for E. pauciflora this is 0.039—see results).Such QST > FST differences, signal adaptive population differentiation due to directionalselection [60], and have been found in other studies relating population variation in treePlants 2022, 11, 1846 14 of 29species with climate (reviewed in [5]; see also [10,65]). Our conclusion that the infraspecificpopulation variation we observed in our study species reflects divergent selection is furthersupported by the lack of statistical significance we detected in most cases for a correlationbetween the pairwise matrices of quantitative and molecular population divergence withinspecies (Table 5), as also found in other studies [65,66].Second, the two species may differ in their patterns of climate adaptation due todifferent patterns of correlated evolutionary changes among the focal traits during speciesdivergence (i.e., evolutionary integration [21,22,67]). In addition, for a given species, geneticconstraints associated with genetic architecture within populations may have influencedthe course of phenotypic evolution and adaptive diversification of the conspecific popula-tions [68–70]. It is also possible that, within a species, differences among populations innatural selection may have shaped the genetic (co)variance patterns within populationsover evolutionary time, thus leading to an alignment between genetic architecture andpopulation trajectories [71–73]. For example, for a set of seedling traits, different directionalselection gradient estimates arising from imposed acute drought stress have been reportedfor glasshouse-grown mesic and arid populations of E. pauciflora [74]. Similarly, at thespecies level, two intermixed oak species in the same stand have been shown to exhibitsignificant differences in direction of the selection response and potential for adaptiveevolution [75]. Eucalyptus ovata and E. pauciflora differ significantly in virtually all leaftraits studied, which may also be indicative of the possibility of different developmen-tal/functional integration of leaf traits at the among- and/or within-population levels forclimate adaptation [21].Third, it is possible that species differences in phenotypic plasticity contribute tothe observed discordance in patterns of populations variation [6,76]. We compared thespecies based on their patterns of genetic-based population differentiation in a singlecommon garden. However, genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions in the measuredfunctional traits (i.e., variation in phenotypic plasticity among populations, e.g., [49]) mayhave differentially masked genetic-based variation in one-or-other species for a trait. Thisis possible as GxE interactions at the species and population levels have been reportedin eucalypts and other tree species for many of the traits we have studied ([77–80], butsee [81]). The inter-trait correlations can also vary with the test environment [51]. Thus, wecannot dismiss the possibility that the observed species differences may reflect alternativeclimate adaptation/acclimation strategies, for example, with E. ovata exploiting plasticity(rather than genetic adaptation) to a larger extent than E. pauciflora.Fourth, species differences in climate adaptation strategy may also occur at the mecha-nism/trait level [58,67,82,83]. For example, as predicted by our second hypothesis [33,35],weak and inconsistent correlations among individual hydraulic and economic traits, as wellas different relationships with climate variables, confirmed that patterns of trait responsesreflected different axes of variation for leaf hydraulic versus economic traits. Further, thetwo species showed differing degrees of population variation in leaf economic versushydraulic traits, suggesting differential species-level exploitation of these trait dimensions.Beyond leaf and hydraulic traits, there are also many other mechanisms that affect theability of plants to persist under stress or environmental change [36,37]. Of note are thevegetative recovery mechanisms that eucalypts possess to recover from crown damageor death including lignotubers and epicormic buds [84,85]. Indeed, significant climate-associated population variation in seedling lignotuber development was reported in bothstudied species and related to climate variables such as maximum temperature that wereprominent in our models [23,86,87].A final explanation for the differences in the amount and pattern of population dif-ferentiation is that the different habitats occupied by the two species may differentiallymodulate climate-driven selection [88,89]. Variation in soil water holding capacity is anobvious example [90], but other climate–soil interactions may be involved. For example, inan early study of E. pauciflora, it was suggested that differences in air and soil temperaturemay change the interplay between leaf transpiration and water uptake by the roots [91].Plants 2022, 11, 1846 15 of 29While E. ovata showed less overall population variation in the studied leaf traits than E.pauciflora, the trait variation in E. ovata was typically more strongly related to climate. Givenour conclusion that much of the trait variation is likely to reflect adaptive divergence, E.pauciflora may be more strongly differentiated by nonclimate factors varying across thebetter-drained soils it occupies, including abiotic factors such as soil depth or type ([92];for an example of drought susceptibility, see also [90]). In contrast, the seasonally water-logged habitat of E. ovata may be more homogeneous across populations but allow theimpact of climate variation on populations to be better expressed. Such modulation couldexplain: (i) the lower population differentiation across the range of E. ovata compared withE. pauciflora; and (ii) why different traits and facets of climate contributed differentially topopulation divergence in each species. The latter is potentially reflected in the differingrelationships of SLA and leaf thickness with climate in the two species. While both speciesproduced higher SLA and thinner leaves with warmer home-site maximum temperatures,consistent with observed better growth performance in plants from warmer environments,this pattern was superimposed on contrasting trait associations with moisture index andprecipitation seasonality that could be modulated by soil factors. Biotic habitat factors suchas differences in the associated enemy and plant community may also alter the effects ofclimate-driven selection on a focal species [93,94]. In Tasmanian eucalypts, for example,the potential for co-occurring rainforest species to affect clines in foliar glaucousness wasnoted early [50], and a recent study showed that drought damage in two focal eucalyptspecies is differentially influenced by neighbouring tree species [95].3.2. Associations between Climate and Trait VariationGiven that directional selection is likely to contribute to the observed patterns inpopulation divergence in leaf traits, a key question addressed by our third hypothesis iswhether trait patterns in E. ovata and E. pauciflora reflected expectations for adaptation toclimate. We found this is possible for a range of traits, especially for E. ovata where up to58% of the total trait variation among population means could be explained by climatevariables. At the same time, lower percentages of the total trait variation were explained byclimate in E. pauciflora, suggesting that nonclimate factors may also be important.Traits were often associated with multiple climate variables within each species. Takentogether, these suggested several patterns of climate adaptation in the study landscape.The integrated signal revealed in E. ovata indicated that populations that originate fromhome-sites with higher maximum temperatures (and less seasonally variable or moreprecipitation) tend to be faster growing and to have characteristics such as higher SLA, lessdense and thinner leaves, smaller and more stomata, and greater vein density. All of thesecharacteristics are consistent with a less conservative, faster growth strategy [27,29,33].Climate-related trends in E. pauciflora were weaker and suggested more prominent roles ofprecipitation-related variables, especially for leaf hydraulic traits.While other recent large-scale, common-garden studies of population variation inforest tree species have shown intraspecific relationships between climate and hydraulicleaf traits [96,97], few common garden studies have investigated intraspecific variationin leaf hydraulic traits in eucalypt species with which to compare our results. However,population studies of associated physiological traits such as photosynthetic rate, stomatalconductance and surrogates of water use efficiency have reported varying degrees ofgenetic variation in these traits [35,43,98,99].Stomata size is frequently linked with whole plant function, for example, smaller sizeis associated with greater capacity for CO2 absorption and greater speed of response toenvironmental signals [48]. In our study, trends in stomata size (i.e., guard cell length) weremore prominent in E. ovata, where decreasing size with home-site maximum temperatureand precipitation seasonality is consistent with faster growth rates and potential for morerapid control of water loss in extreme temperatures or drought. Population differencesinvolving lower drought susceptibility with smaller stomata have been reported in otherPlants 2022, 11, 1846 16 of 29trees [96,100], and in eucalypts, stomatal size has been observed to decrease with decreasingdriest quarter precipitation at the population home-site climate [78].Vein density, representing investment in water transport and ultimately maximumphotosynthetic rate [33,34,101], similarly increased with home-site (mean) temperature inE. ovata. This is consistent with more general expectations that environmental factors thatincrease transpiration of plants or decrease water availability increase the leaf venationdensity [47]; although a previous study of wild eucalypt populations found vein densitiesincreased with increasing home-site aridity rather than temperature as in our study [102].No trends were detectable in E. pauciflora, more consistent with the absence of a veindensity-climate association reported among species of the Australian Proteaceae [39].Stomatal density was the main leaf hydraulic trait associated with climate-relatedpopulation differentiation in both of our study species. In E. ovata it was related to home-sitetemperature, consistent with reports for other tree [97] and shrub [103] species. Populationmean stomatal density was positively correlated with stomatal length per unit leaf areaand vein density, consistent with coordinated water transport, with both traits affecting themaximum rates of photosynthesis and water loss [104,105]. However, while the variationin stomatal density may reflect adaptation for faster growth in warmer home-sites, it couldalso reflect local adaptation for ‘heat avoidance’ through evaporative cooling [26,103,106].While Tasmania has a cool-temperate, oceanic climate, this possibility cannot be dismissedas maximum temperatures in summer can average nearly 30 ◦C in inland regions [107]and population variation in all stomatal traits in E. ovata was associated with home-sitemaximum temperature (TMXWW). Such adaptation may explain the stronger relationshipsof hydraulic traits with temperature in E. ovata but not in co-occurring E. pauciflora, asevaporative cooling may be advantageous in some of the seasonally waterlogged habitatsin which E. ovata grows, but deleterious in more water-limited E. pauciflora habitats [108].Indeed, stomatal density was more strongly associated with moisture-related climatevariables in co-occurring E. pauciflora, with stomatal density increasing with increasinghome-site precipitation seasonality and aridity (i.e., lower precipitation of the driest week,RDRYW), which could reflect an adaptation for fast growth when sufficient soil water isseasonally available ([109]; see below).The leaf economic traits generally contributed more to population-level differentiationand climate adaptation in E. ovata and E. pauciflora than did the leaf hydraulic traits (e.g.,comparisons of adjusted R2 values Table 6), as evident in other forest tree studies (e.g., [65]).In contrast to the hydraulic traits, there are many studies reporting significant populationdifferentiation and climate-trait associations involving the leaf economic traits studied. Acommon trend in evergreen species is for leaf area and SLA to decrease and leaf thicknessto increase with decreasing home-site precipitation [10,110–112], with more sclerophyllousleaves (low SLA) thought to have more conservative water use [113]. In eucalypts, thisprecipitation-trait association has been reported at the population level in a number ofcommon-garden studies [77,79,98].On the other hand, in the two evergreen species we studied, SLA increased and leafthickness decreased with increasing home-site maximum temperature (and potentiallygrowth rates, Table 4). This is a less commonly reported trend but has been reported formaximum temperature in E. microcarpa [114] and for minimum temperature in an evergreenPistacia species [88]. In the landscape studied, the temperature trend was superimposedon different associations with precipitation seasonality (E. ovata) and moisture index ofthe wettest quarter (E. pauciflora), which could be interpreted as populations from hotterhome-sites with seasonally uniform precipitation (E. ovata) or high soil water availability(E. pauciflora) evolving more towards a faster growth strategy. Nevertheless, when precipi-tation seasonality was modelled alone in E. pauciflora, it showed opposite trends to E. ovatawith respect to precipitation seasonality, with SLA increasing and leaf thickness decreasingwith increasing precipitation seasonality. This suggests that the adaptive strategy in pop-ulations of E. pauciflora from home-sites with more seasonal precipitation allows for fastresource acquisition and growth rates when sufficient soil water is available, analogous toPlants 2022, 11, 1846 17 of 29that reported for seasonally arid populations of a neotropical oak [36,109]. Such recoveryfrom seasonal water stress may involve repair and recovery of hydraulic function, whichmay be rapid in E. pauciflora [115].In the cool-temperate climate in which our study species grow, frost is also a selectiveagent [107]. Frost will impact the other extreme of the temperature gradient and couldreinforce the temperature associations involving leaf economic traits. Average wintertemperatures are highly correlated with the temperature variables included in our analysis(TMXWW and TANN; r > 0.8) and there is evidence in E. pauciflora that thicker leavesare less susceptible to internal freezing [116], consistent with our observations of thickerleaves in both study species at lower (maximum) temperatures. Further, leaf density alsoincreased with decreasing home-site maximum temperature in E. ovata. Increasing leafdensity generally reflects smaller cells with thicker walls, and relatively less intracellularair space [110,117], which could thus represent an additional adaptive pathway to cold orfrost tolerance, as also found for E. tricarpa [79].3.3. Conclusions and ImplicationsWe showed that patterns of functional trait differentiation of populations within treespecies that co-occur across the same geographic and climatic landscape are uncorrelated. Acomponent of the differentiation in functional traits is likely to have arisen through climate-driven directional selection, consistent with a range of other studies in eucalypts [43,118]and other species [5,7,11,12,119]. On the other hand, the lack of correlation in patternsof population variation in the two species when they co-occurred, and the associateddifferences in climate-trait associations, suggest that the trajectories of climate-driven localadaptation are different. This may be due to historical, genetic, and/or ecological factors.Indeed, with the two species occupying different habitats and markedly different in growthand leaf economic traits, it is likely that climate stressors impact species differently evenwhen they co-occur in the same landscape.Importantly, while the level of population differentiation and climate-trait associa-tions detected in our study signal historic climate adaptation, at this early stage in thelife cycle of our study plants, links with growth performance were only beginning toemerge. Indeed, with long-lived trees such as our study species, a key challenge remains inlinking the observed variation in functional traits to long-term fitness consequences at theindividual [120] and population levels.Finally, our results have two clear implications for climate-based provenancing strate-gies. First, evidence for climate-driven directional selection within our study eucalypts,consistent with findings for other plant species, supports the potential value of capturingthis adaptive diversity through provenancing strategies that increase climate resilience(e.g., [4,121]). Second, the demonstrated lack of correlation in climate-trait associationsbetween our co-occurring study species indicates that specific patterns of climate adaptionare difficult to predict. We thus propose that selection of populations for climate-resilientplantings needs to focus on sampling broadly across gradients reflecting multiple facets(e.g., temperature and precipitation means, extremes, and seasonality) of projected futureclimates. This strategy would maximise the climate-adaptive variation captured in forestryand ecological renovation investments until further generalisations or species-specificinformation is available for weighting the importance of the key climate variables forprovenance selection (e.g., [122]).4. Materials and Methods4.1. Study SpeciesThe study species were Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. pauciflora (hereafter, E. pauciflora)and E. ovata subsp. ovata (hereafter, E. ovata), the main tree species being used in ecologicalrestoration projects in one of the most arid regions of Tasmania [118,123]. They are fromdifferent, reproductively isolated [124] subgenera (subgenus Eucalyptus and subgenusSymphyomyrtus, respectively) and are thus phylogenetically and genetically independent.Plants 2022, 11, 1846 18 of 29Both species are widely distributed in and native to south-eastern Australia. Eucalyptuspauciflora has one of the broadest altitudinal ranges of any eucalypt (i.e., growing fromsea-level to near the alpine tree line), whereas E. ovata is replaced by other species athigher altitudes. At mid-altitudes, these species co-occur across large components of thegeographic range of their natural distributions in Tasmania, but occupy different ecologicalniches within the landscape [125]. Eucalyptus ovata occurs on seasonally poorly-drainedsites and is replaced by E. pauciflora on well-drained sites.4.2. Source PopulationsThe source populations studied were distributed across the overlapping climatic andgeographic ranges of E. ovata and E. pauciflora within Tasmania; this region of overlap iscentred in the Tasmanian Midlands. Within this region, we sampled 22 locations whereE. ovata and E. pauciflora occurred in close geographic proximity (Figure 4, Table S3). Thispairing of populations ensured that, while the species occupied different local habitats, themacro-climatic gradients experienced by the populations of each species were effectivelythe same (hereafter, ‘common climate landscape’). The 22 sampled populations of E. ovataranged in altitude from 9–746 m (Table S1) and encompassed virtually the full altitudinalrange reported for E. ovata in Tasmania [125]. They were spread across the full range ofmean annual temperature (TANN) experienced by wild populations of E. ovata in Tasmania,and covered the annual precipitation range (RANN) experienced by much of the speciesdistribution, except for high precipitation outliers (Figure 4). The sampled populations of E.pauciflora extended over a similar altitudinal range (16–824 m, Table S1), but as E. paucifloraextends to higher altitudes than E. ovata [125,126], the higher altitudinal component of the E.pauciflora distribution, representing the lower temperature extremity, was not representedin our paired study. Further, as our study species also occur in mainland Australia, theupper extremities of mean annual temperature in Tasmania (c. 14 ◦C) did not represent theextremities of their broader range in Australia (c. 17.5 ◦C). Hence our study did not aim toinvestigate the significance of adaptation in range-edge populations, which have in somestudies been found to be the most adaptively differentiated [80,127].Figure 4.

(Images:P.A. Harrison).4.3. Experimental Common GardenThe provenance trials of the two eucalypt species (E. ovata and E. pauciflora) studiedwere part of a set of multi-purpose common-garden trials established at Connorville,Tasmania (41.828◦ S, 147.138◦ E, altitude 185 m) [123]. The common garden represented aclimate at the drier, mid-temperature range of the sampled provenances (Figure 4). Theseedlings used to establish the common garden were grown for 9–11 months (E. ovata) and16–17 months (E. pauciflora) in outdoor nursery conditions, then planted at Connorvilleon 6–8 August 2014. The trials were established on an ex-pasture site, likely to have beendominated originally by a mix of E. viminalis and E. amygdalina with the occasional E.ovata and E. pauciflora. The area was surrounded with deer proof fencing to exclude largevertebrate herbivores. Within this area, each of the field trials was established with eightblocks, with the blocks of each species spatially paired across the planting area. Each blockcontained up to 360 families derived from single-tree open-pollinated seed collections fromnative populations across their shared geographic range in Tasmania [123]. Families wererandomly allocated as single-tree plots within each block of a given trial. Our study wasbased on a subsample of each of the focal 22 populations of either species. Each subsampleper population included one plant from each of five blocks (110 plants per species, with thefive individuals sampled per population representing five unique families).4.4. Trait MeasurementsSampling at the common garden was undertaken when plants were two years old(June 2016). We quantified a suite of whole plant performance measures, leaf economictraits and leaf hydraulic traits for each sampled individual, as described below.4.4.1. Growth Performance MeasuresPlant height and diameter were measured approximately two years after planting,on 1–2 June 2016. We measured the diameter of each stem at 0.5 m above ground level,and the height of the tallest stem using height poles. Total stem cross-sectional area wascalculated from diameter data. Many of the trees had multiple stems from just aboveground level, and in these trees the cross-sectional area of each stem was calculated, andPlants 2022, 11, 1846 20 of 29following Davidson et al. [128] a single-stem diameter equivalent was derived from thesum of these cross-sectional areas.4.4.2. Leaf TraitsFor each individual, 13 fully expanded leaves excluding petioles were collected fromthree branches distributed around the mid-outer, sun-exposed part of the canopy [79,129].Once collected, three leaves per individual were immediately placed into the fridge at 4 ◦Cin double zip lock bags for analyses of stomatal and venation traits, whilst the remaining10 leaves were stored in the fridge for the measurements of leaf economic traits.The measured leaf economic traits,
