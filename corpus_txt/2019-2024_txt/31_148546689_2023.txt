Funding opportunities, while increasing in recent years, remain severely limitedcompared to the pace and scale of action required. The lack of an effective regionalgovernance system and unclear roles and responsibilities for local and regional agenciescreate additional barriers. The urgency of addressing community needs and other localissues, particularly as the impacts of climate change worsen, combined with the perceptionthat a regional focus could divert resources away from local needs, can also create barriersand delay adaptation progress across the region. Despite these challenges, the importance of regional action, coordination, and collaborationhas never been clearer. A regional perspective is essential to understanding communityneeds beyond the jurisdiction they reside or work in, to identify critical infrastructure andservices to preserve and expand at the regional scale. This includes the natural ecosystemsand resources that communities rely upon that span multiple jurisdictional boundaries. Thebenefits of regional coordination are extensive – from attracting greater investments into theregion to better leveraging the region’s human capital to efficiently and inclusively plan andimplement climate adaptation projects.This case study details the process of developing the San Diego Region Coastal ResilienceRoadmap with particular attention to how this process can be replicated in other regionsthroughout California – for coastal resilience, as well as other climate impacts and communitypriorities.The San Diego Region Coastal Resilience Roadmap project was funded through a CoastalResilience Grant awarded by the Ocean Protection Council, and led by the San DiegoRegional Climate Collaborative (SDRCC) in partnership with Resilient Cities Catalyst andCivicWell. While the Roadmap itself has been completed, SDRCC will continue working withpartners throughout the San Diego region to provide critical coordination support and ensurethe successful implementation of the Roadmap.A Case for Regional ActionAbout the San Diego RegionCoastal Resilience RoadmapAs communities across the San Diego region grapple with how to plan for greater riskand damages as a result of coastal flooding, annual storm surges, king tides, andother shocks and stresses, there is growing recognition of the need to strengthencollaboration across jurisdictions and across sectors. The San Diego Region CoastalResilience Roadmap recognizes the vital role of the coastline in supporting theregion’s economic, environmental, and social prosperity, and seeks to mobilize  climate practitioners around a common vision and a set of priority coastal resilienceprojects to advance across the San Diego region.Grounded in equity and accessibility, the Roadmapreflects an approach that considers the region’s holisticsocial-ecological coastal system and fosters a regionalcapacity to transform and become more resilient. TheRoadmap is designed to serve as a dynamic document tofacilitate and strengthen regional collaboration, motivatingand inspiring coordinated ongoing action among regionalpartners. Through 6 Principles, 30 Goals, and 76 specific Actions,the Roadmap amplifies tangible opportunities toimplement aligned multi-benefit projects that address theregion’s most urgent shocks and stresses. Actions setforth within these Principles are not exclusively focusedon achieving outcomes for natural, ecological systems,nor are they focused solely on economic or socialimpacts–rather, each Action drives towards multiplebenefits.By aligning planning goals on a regional scale, theRoadmap aims to foster multi-jurisdictional resiliencethrough coordinated planning that leads to high-impactprojects and tangible outcomes to further local andregional climate resilience goals. Through specificPrinciples and Goals, the Roadmap elevates and outlinescomprehensive, practical, and tangible pathways to buildmulti-sectoral consensus around a high-level vision, anddelivers a set of prioritized actions to guideimplementation for decades to come.Roadmap DevelopmentThe development of the San Diego Region Coastal Resilience Roadmap was informed bythree critical project phases:Assessing ExistingConditions1The project team conducted aNetwork Analysis through anonline survey to betterunderstand the current andpotential roles of key regionalpartners in building a moreresilient coastal region. Surveyrespondents shared theirperceptions of how key actors areconnected to coastal resilienceand how these relationshipsmight be strengthened tofacilitate additional collaborativeaction. This phase revealed fouropportunities for action –developing a shared vision,making funding more accessible,amplifying knowledge sharingnetworks, and supporting cross-sector engagement.Assessing ExistingAssets2A robust Literature Review wasconducted that analyzed 150regional documents and plans toexplore, understand, andsynthesize how the regionidentifies exposure to shocks andstresses, as well as what actionsare underway to mitigate andadapt to these impacts. Thisphase provided the project teamwith a deep understanding of theregion’s existing priorities, plans,and projects related to coastalresilience and reinforced theneed to support leaders incontinuing, scaling, andimplementing their efforts.Deep Engagement withRegional Stakeholders3With a robust understanding of the region’sresilience landscape, a Regional CoastalResilience Ambassadors (RCRA) Cohort wasformed to provide strategic guidance and informthe direction of the Roadmap. The RCRA Cohortincluded grassroots organizations, local andregional government agencies, Tribes and tribalpartners, and research institutions representing adiversity of sectors, disciplines, and sub-regions.The RCRA Cohort identified common threadsacross regional priorities to directly inform thedevelopment of the Roadmap’s Principles andGoals. The project team then convened FocusGroups for each of the Roadmap’s six Principlesto convene regional experts and partners toidentify actions already underway, ripe forapplication in the Roadmap, as well as proposedactions to address key gaps and advance coastalresilience efforts across the region.A robust understanding of the region1The leadership and active involvement of the San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative(SDRCC) was critical for the development of the Roadmap, due to its long history as avital regional coordinating entity and direct experience working on climate issuesthroughout the region. By actively participating in and guiding all aspects of this project,SDRCC supported the team to better understand the region’s climate risks, culturalvalues, political context, and existing connections across organizations and agencies.Guidance & LessonsLearnedThe San Diego Region Coastal Resilience Roadmap serves as a model that other regions can replicate toalign practitioners across their region around a common vision for climate resilience and to develop astrategic roadmap to catalyze action. This section highlights guidance and lessons learned from the projectteam to support others interested in pursuing a similar roadmapping process.Reciprocal relationships in place2An inclusive roadmapping effort will require participation from a diversity of partners,many of whom will undoubtedly be facing capacity constraints. Having reciprocalrelationships already in place helped the project team engage a broad set ofpractitioners across the San Diego region, including representatives from bothcoastal and inland communities to inform the regional roadmap. Furthermore,keeping reciprocity front and center throughout the project reinforced a collaborativeenvironment with active participation from partners who also received targetedsupport from the project team to help address their needs and challenges.Connections to past planning efforts3The Roadmap is a reflection of many years of work, input, and, especially,collaboration from partners throughout the San Diego region. By recognizing bothprevious and parallel regional planning efforts to situate the development of thisroadmap in the region’s broader context, this effort is built upon and is helping tobuild momentum for regional collaboration and action.Readiness ConditionsBefore embarking on your region’s roadmapping journey, having the following conditions in place can help toensure a productive and successful effort.Do your homework before engaging stakeholders1The project team conducted a desktop literature review, analyzing 150 regional documents and plans, to obtain a robustunderstanding of how partners throughout the region are prioritizing shocks and stresses, as well as actions being undertaken toaddress climate impacts. This enabled the team to respectfully engage stakeholders, honoring their time and energy participating inworkshops and focus groups, by guiding informed and productive dialogues focused on critical gaps and opportunities for coastalresilience.Focus on foundational principles to establish a shared vision2A shared vision is needed to serve as a North Star to guide the development of a regional roadmap. However, by bringing a verydiverse group of leaders together for the RCRA Cohort, the project team quickly realized that starting with a vision could be achallenge due to the many different perspectives and priorities represented. The project team focused first on establishing acommon set of principles that resonated with Cohort leaders, which informed the creation of a shared regional vision for coastalresilience. This approach ensured early buy-in and a sense of co-ownership among partners.Elevate existing and planned projects3The literature review and network analysis revealed the variety of coastal resilience initiatives being led by the region’s robustecosystem of partners, as well as opportunities for greater coordination to bolster ongoing efforts, scale successful programs, andpursue new multi-benefit projects. The project team also recognized that ongoing capacity and resource constraints have createdbarriers to fully implementing planned projects. As such, the Roadmap was designed to meet existing needs across the region andto connect individual projects to a broader regional vision by uplifting existing and planned projects to be fully funded and proposinga set of new actions to address critical coastal resilience gaps.Roadmap DevelopmentA thoughtful and flexible approach is critical to developing a regional roadmap that creates a strongfoundation for collaborative action.Consider the usability of the Roadmapbeyond the creation of a report1The project team recognized the need to develop a cross-cuttingstrategic plan that could effectively drive toward improvedresilience outcomes. The team was intentional about designing astructure that would elevate priority projects and supportpractitioners in gaining buy-in from the necessary stakeholders,funders, and decision makers. The resulting Roadmap is adynamic tool that can be leveraged to attract investments and willultimately accelerate the implementation of projects that build theregion’s coastal resilience.Moving Towards OutcomesClearly identifying and staying focused on the desired outcomes of a regional roadmap can ensure an action-oriented effort that generates tangible results.Repurpose findings to developadditional tools2To inform the Roadmap, a significant amount of information wasgathered from partners in regards to existing and plannedprojects, as well as proposed actions to advance coastalresilience, some of which was not included in the final Roadmapas it is intended to serve as a strategic plan focused on a set ofpriority projects. The project team decided to repurpose thiswealth of information to develop an Actions Database, which wasnot part of the project’s original scope of work. By remainingfocused on the project’s desired outcomes (rather than contractedoutputs), the team developed a living tool to provide practitionerswith a better understanding of the suite of actions alreadyunderway or planned throughout the region, and offers anopportunity to provide ongoing updates and ideas on new actionsto prioritize. Identify a lead coordinator toshepherd forward the next steps3Having a lead coordinator is critical to support the level ofcollaboration that is needed to move a regional roadmap forward.Without a lead coordinator, the completion of the roadmap maynot result in the outcomes envisioned, or even discouragepartners from supporting implementation efforts or participating ina future regional planning effort. SDRCC, as a coordinating entitysituated in the San Diego region with a core membershiprepresenting greater than 80% of the region, is well-equipped tocontinue building momentum for implementation and maintaininga collaborative environment along the way.
