With such a large area, it is no wonder that the Pekalongan region produces a lot of human resources so creative ideas emerge from them and it is known as the world's creative city. Their form of creativity can be seen in the handcrafts they produce. Apart from crafts, Pekalongan is known for its innovative tourism and educational tours. Article History: Received: 13 December 2022  ||  Accepted: 27 April 2023 ||  Published: 28 June 2023 18 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery One of the forms of creativity can be seen in the processed tofu business in Babalan Lor Village, Bojong District, Pekalongan Regency. This village is one of the largest tofu production centers in Pekalongan. Tofu, which is produced in Babalan Lor Village, has been marketed throughout the area around Pekalongan. Moreover, the tofu produced is also processed into various processed products. Through this activity, tofu in Babalan Lor can improve the economy of the community, and the village has been designated as a village with the slogan "Kampung Tahu (Educational Tourism Village)" since 2015. However, at the beginning of 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic became the biggest obstacle for the tofu makers and ecotourism of Kampung Tahu, Babalan Lor Village, Bojong District. The covid-19 pandemic has spread thoroughly in countries around the world and has affected everyone and caused many fatalities. A very deadly virus outbreak in a short period of time has also affected all aspects of life throughout the country. Almost all sectors of life, from economic, political, social, to cultural were also affected by the Covid-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, the economic sector was one of the sectors most affected by the Covid-19 pandemic (Arianto, 2020). It was due to government policy imposing restrictions on business activities and people's lives which then resulted in a decrease in people's purchasing power resulting in termination of employment. As a result, many companies and businessmen in various countries have had to close their businesses. Even for developing countries, the Covid-19 pandemic caused devaluation, Small Medium Enterprise (SME/UMKM) closure, and other social problems. In other words, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on all countries in the world. In addition to affecting the decline in the business activity level which resulted in a decrease in people's purchasing power, the Covid-19 outbreak also affected the unemployment rate which continued to increase in a fast period of time. The unemployment rate was expected to continue to rise amid concerns that the government's stimulus program would not make much of a real contribution to suppressing the Covid-19 pandemic. Hence, the unemployment rate increased day by day.  In Indonesia, the Covid-19 virus outbreak has had a major impact on tourism and economic activities in both the upper and lower-middle-level economies. The most prominent economic activity occurred in the trade sector where the availability of materials for production is disrupted due to the import disruption of raw materials from abroad to Indonesia. Besides that, the export sector in Indonesia 19 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery also experienced a decline due to a decrease in raw materials demand from international markets which also caused the value decrease of the raw materials. On the other hand, the coronavirus also had a positive impact on economic activity in Indonesia in the trade sector.  This positive impact provided opportunities for the community to strengthen the domestic economy by prioritizing the domestic market and strengthening the purchasing power of the community. The priority in question was that domestic businesses could process raw materials into materials that were ready to be used or consumed in society (Prakoso, 2021). Like in the tofu village, the production of tofu in this educational tourism village was slightly disrupted due to the unstable soybean prices caused by the Covid-19 outbreak. The impact of Covid-19 has also greatly affected the domestic tourism industry due to the limited number of tourists visiting tourist attractions due to social restrictions and travel restrictions, such as the Kampung Tahu tourist attraction located in Babalan Lor village. The tofu village felt a huge impact with the outbreak of the covid-19 virus which caused the tofu village tour to be temporarily closed due to regulations from the local government who were worried that the covid-19 virus would spread to the residents. Even though there was an impact felt by the tofu village residents, it did not dampen the enthusiasm that was driven by the Babalan Lor village community from all levels of tofu entrepreneurs and tofu village tourism managers to maintain their existence and restore their economic conditions. With the spirit of economic recovery, therefore, this research is intended to discuss the economic recovery by implementing management functions in the tofu educational tourism village, Babalan Lor Village, Bojong District, Pekalongan Regency.  Research Methods The approach used in this research was qualitative methods. In using qualitative methods, researchers focused on in-depth observations and produced a comprehensive study of phenomena in the field. The form used in the study was field research where it succeeded in expressing the meaning obtained from the community members. The analysis used in this research was managerial analysis. The research results were found through the POAC principle. Sources of data obtained in this study were through observations and interviews. The interviews 20 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery conducted included interviews with the head of the RT in the tofu tourism-education village, Babalan Lor Village, managers, and also local residents.    Result and Discussion A. History of the Babalan Lor Tourism Village The tourist village in Babalan Lor Village is located in Bojong District, Pekalongan Regency. This village was a slum and unkempt settlement in the past. It could be seen from the buildings and infrastructure qualities which did not meet the requirements (inadequate) (Nursyahbani & Bitta, 2015). The village residents used the river to dispose of waste and as sanitation channels, so the banks of the river in Kampung Tahu looked dirty. In the development of the tofu educational tourism village in Babalan Lor Village, the government took time to make the local community aware to build private sanitary sewers, to avoid dumping waste into the river and for the community to be willing to dismantle buildings built on the banks of the river. Socialization continued to develop the tofu village to be even better. The discourse on the development of Kampung Tahu started in 2007 when a program from the government called PNPM contributed to support the implementation of Kampung Tahu development. However, the development of Kampung Tahu had only been implemented in 2015 as the residents followed the socialization advice from the government. In 2015, the tofu village began to be built by dismantling illegal buildings on the banks of the river and rearranging the tofu village to become a model village. Funding for the village development was obtained from the World Bank, which was previously concerned about the condition of Kampung Tahu. The funds obtained at the start of construction were around IDR 2,000,000,000 (two billion rupiah). The development was proceeding normally, but in the midst of the construction of Kampung Tahu, the money provided by the World Bank was not sufficient to complete the construction. Upon knowing this, the central government provided additional money to finance the development of Kampung Tahu Babalan Lor. The amount was  IDR 2,000,000,000 (two billion rupiahs) as support from the central government in Kampung Tahu development. In addition, the PERKIM LH service (People's Housing and Settlement Areas and the Environment of Pekalongan Regency) added additional funds as support for the development of Kampung Tahu in Babalan Lor Village worth IDR 132,000,000 (one hundred thirty-two million rupiahs). Then, the government 21 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery built settlements in Kampung Tofu with the PLPBK (community-based residential environmental management) program.  After the development of the Kampung Tahu educational tourism village, the local community created an organizational structure for the management of Kampung Tahu called the Kampung Tahu management agency (BPKT). In its management, the BPKT had a role in arranging the schedule of visits from institutions to Kampung Tahu educational tourism. Moreover, BPKT also managed the finances of educational tourism of kampung Tahu in Babalan Lor Village.  B. Activity Programs in the Tourism Village of Babalan Lor Village The programs implemented in the Kampung Tahu include TPS 3R (3R waste disposal sites), educational tours, soybean processing crafts, and factory waste treatment. The programs showed positive indicators. The positive indicators mean that the program implementation in the field was running quite well, such as: 1. Educational Tourism Educational tourism or eudotourism is a tourism program that offers tourists to visit a tourist location to get direct learning experiences from tourist attractions (Ratih et al., 2013: 12). The implementation of educational tourism in Kampung Tahu went well. The advertisements issued by the Kampung Tahu administrators were able to attract interest from institutions to do regular visits or even research. There were quite a lot of tourism objects offered in Kampung Tahu educational tours, such as the process of making tofu, managing tofu waste, managing household waste at waste disposal sites, handcrafts, and water tourism. During their visit, the tourists could see how the transformation of Kampung Tahu, how it was once a poor slum village and had become a clean and orderly village, and a model for other villages in environmental change and management. This offer made the visitors experience and learn how to protect, manage, and care for the environment. The success of this educational tourism program could be seen in 2015-2019 when it was able to attract visitors from various backgrounds, from elementary schools to tertiary institutions, as well as other institutions. This program was also able to attract visitors from outside the area, such as from Solo, Tangerang, and East Java to conduct comparative studies and model 22 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery the village system.  Unfortunately, 2020 was a bad year for Kampung Tahu because of the Covid-19 pandemic that disrupted Kampung Tahu tourism activities. 2. Soybean Management In general, management is an activity that changes something to be better and the value offered is much higher (Nugroho, 2003:119). Management is a language commonly used in management science. Etymologically, the term management comes from the word management which refers to managing or handling something to achieve goals (Nugroho, 2011: 12). Soybean management is an activity to manage and provide high-value products derived from soy ingredients. In Kampung Tahu, the managing of soybeans was through making them into tofu and various processed tofu creations. In its management, Kampung Tahu maintained the preservation of the surrounding environment, so it was not polluted by waste that could damage the environment. Soybeans that were processed into tofu were further developed by the surrounding community so they could have higher selling power. Various food creations from the soybean processing in Kampung Tahu produced various kinds of snacks or food for tourists such as processing soybeans into tofu, burgers, tofu donuts, tofu art pudding, and also tofu bowls. Siti Mu'rofah, one of the residents of Kampung Tahu, said that the creation of this food was made to increase the selling price of processed soybeans. Hence, tofu, which was usually processed normally, could be more profitable for the sellers. The marketing method to sell processed tofu used offline and online methods. The online method used in marketing processed tofu utilized social media, such as Whatsapp and Facebook. Local residents explained that the processing of soybean-based food was not difficult and was quite easy to do. The income generated from processed tofu for the residents was quite good; it was around Rp. 300,000/day before the pandemic occurred. However, since the pandemic, the production of tofu-based food by the villagers dropped dramatically. 3. Waste Management in Kampung Tahu Educational Tourism Waste, which is commonly referred to as a pollutant or garbage, is an inseparable part of the industrial and household environment. The effects of 23 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery the waste can produce an environmental imbalance. In Kampung Village, industrial waste management had been designed in a structured way so that the environment was maintained. The PLPBK (Community-Based Residential Environmental Arrangement) program supported Kampung Tahu in managing industrial and household waste. Waste from tofu factory production was transformed into something valuable and environmentally friendly. One of the industrial waste management was converting tofu waste into biogas which would then be distributed to the local community. Processing the tofu waste into biogas had a good impact on the surrounding environment, such as rivers that were not polluted by factory waste. The community and tofu businessmen in Kampung Village did not need to buy LPG gas because they benefited from the management of biogas produced by the tofu manufacturing industry. The biogas produced was distributed free of charge to the local community after passing through the shelter in a container that had a depth of seven meters for one week. From the process that was going through continuously, it would immediately produce biogas without having to wait for how long the biogas process would be produced. In using biogas waste, the local community could not use just any stove. The stove used was a special stove that could distribute biogas. The government taught the community how to use this special stove, so people would not be confused. However, this particular stove required special care to be able to last long and not be damaged. If the biogas stove was damaged, the gas would have released a smell of waste which could be annoying. In addition to the program for processing industrial waste into biogas, Kampung Tahu also processed household waste into various kinds of handcraft and compost. Household waste was obtained from Kampung Tahu community with a system of grouping organic (leaves, wood, etc.), inorganic waste as well as grouping waste that could be sold to collectors (plastic bottles, etc.), and waste that could only be recycled (plastic, candy wrappers, etc.). The waste management system used a household waste savings system where the waste deposited by local residents would be replaced with money depending on the amount of waste. Organic waste would be converted into compost which had economic value. The compost would be used as a natural fertilizer for plants around Kampung Tahu and sold to several places in the Pekalongan area. Apart from 24 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery the compost, the villagers knew how to make creative crafts from used plastic materials. These crafts were in the form of making shopping bags from used plastic snacks, making knick-knacks from bottle waste, and so on. The management program is under the auspices of the Community Self-Reliance Agency (BKM). Another waste that has economic value was tofu solid waste. This waste would be processed into bongkrek food ingredients, animal feed mixtures, and brick-making mixtures. Tofu waste for the mixture of brick was taken by brick makers in the Karangdadap sub-district, Pekalongan district. This waste management program could change the face of Kampung Tahu of Babalan Lor village from a poor slum village to an organized and clean environment. However, since the outbreak of Covid-19, several programs were stopped, such as managing household waste and reducing the distribution of biogas to the surrounding community due to the special stove damage. The program stopped due to the lack of financial support from the government as it diverted funds to handling the Covid-19 pandemic instead.  C. Implementation of Management Functions in Post-Covid-19 Pandemic Economic Recovery The initial appearance of the Covid-19 virus in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019, spread to 185 countries, infected around 4,254,800 people, and caused more than 287,293 fatalities people globally. To tackle the further spread of the Covid-19 virus, governments around the world implemented steps or methods to block entry to countries and cities. It included blocking roads in and out of both villages and towns, closing teaching and learning spaces and workplaces, and limiting large-scale gatherings. These restrictions were commonly known as the "Great Lockdown" which caused many global economic activities to stop and caused business losses which resulted in a higher rate of unemployment. It also had an impact on the service industry which caused a downturn and decreased manufacturing activity. In the study of economic theory, physical distancing or extra discipline and restrictions on community activities will cause a decrease in the aggregate supply in the economy which will then have an impact on decreasing the amount of production. People could only stay at home. Due to the law of supply and demand, it eventually would result in a decrease in aggregate demand which would then lead to a decrease in the amount of production.  25 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery In early March 2020, the pandemic entered Indonesia and it disturbed and disrupted the economic system and the daily lives of Indonesians. The pandemic reduced the number of tourists and hampered the economy in Indonesia. In Kampung Tahu, it also hampered the programs that were being carried out. The activities of residents and tourists were limited causing a decrease in the number of tourists in Kampung Tahu. The decrease in the number of tourists affected the creation of processed tofu production in Kampung Tahu educational tourism in Babalan Lor Village. The production of processed tofu has decreased due to the reduced number of tourists coming to Kampung Tahu educational tours. Apart from the decreased production, activities related to the economy in Kampung Tahu also stopped due to the gatherings ban. One of the halted programs was the processing of household waste which was carried out by Kampung Tahu tourism administrators which involved the community. The cessation of the program resulted in the crafts production of processed plastic waste no longer running. Hence, many people lost additional income from the production of waste that had sales value. Kampung   Tahu educational tourism in Babalan Lor also stopped due to Covid-19. Many tourist facilities were not maintained because there were no visitors. Hence, the tour administrators no longer got income from educational tours of Kampung Tahu as their income only relied on the visitor. It made the tourism administrators reluctant to take care of assets and facilities in Kampung Tahu tours. Another impact felt by the people in Babalan Lor Tourism Village was the reduced production of homemade tofu business in the village. The Covid-19 pandemic caused many production activities to stop, one of which was affected by the Covid-19 pandemic was Kampung Tahu. Many tofu processors have stopped producing either from factories or home industries (Saputra & Ali, 2022). The majority of people who used to produce tofu chose to find other jobs as the income from selling tofu was decreasing day by day, coupled with the soaring price of soybeans, which initially only cost 5-6 thousand per kilo to 14 thousand per kilo. The marketing of tofu produced by the community had already supplied various markets in the Pekalongan area, starting from Bojong Market, Wiradesa Market, Kedungwuni Market, Wonopringgo Market, Kajen Market, Paninggaran Market, even Kalibening Market, Banjarnegara Regency. However, this production activity had stopped completely since the outbreak of the Covid-19 26 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery virus, both large home industry production activities and small home production. With the impact of Covid-19, many tofu producers have switched professions to merchants, laborers, and some prefer opening other businesses, such as convection. Based on the results of interviews with the Kampung Tahu tourism administrators in Babalan Lor Village, there are only a few who still survive as tofu makers. There are eight houses that can still survive as tofu makers today. It consists of four houses in the west and another four in the east. The decrease in the number of tofu businesses in the tourist village has resulted in a decline in the economy of the community. This economic downturn which is a chain process will not only have an impact on real economic fundamentals but also affect the smooth functioning of the market mechanism between supply and demand, so it can operate normally and in balance. Considering that the vital aspects of the economy, which are supply, demand and supply chain, have been disrupted, the effects or impacts of the crisis will be felt thoroughly and evenly at all layers or levels of society. In connection with the resilience of each layer or level that is not the same, the middle to lower-class economic community, especially micro and informal workers who earn daily, can certainly be the group that is most vulnerable to getting affected (Puspitasari, 2020: 12). The economic recovery strategy in Kampung Tahu educational tourism cannot be separated from the existence of a management system that regulates it. There are several management principles in handling and recovering the post-pandemic economy; they are the principles of planning, organizing, actuating, and controlling (POAC). Below is the application of management carried out by the community in Kampung Tahu educational tourism village of Tahu Village, it is adjusted to the management function proposed by GR. Terry in the form of; Planning, Organizing Actuating, and Controlling (Mustofa et al., 2017). 1. Planning Planning is an activity or method to prepare something systematically to achieve a goal. Planning is a way to achieve goals well with existing resources to be effective and efficient.  In economic recovery and national resilience, it is necessary to have well-organized planning as the effects that have arisen as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic are truly extraordinary for the economy of people around 27 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery the world, especially the people in Kampung Tahu educational tourism for the past 2 years. The tofu producers in the village of Babalan Lor have strategies so their businesses can still run normally even though being hit by the Covid-19 outbreak. The planning carried out by tofu makers is the same strategy used; it is setting aside the sales profit to anticipate a decrease in sales during the Covid-19 virus outbreak. 2. Organizing Organizing is the process of dividing work into small tasks, assigning those tasks to people according to their abilities,  allocating resources, and coordinating them in an effective framework for achieving organizational goals. Meanwhile, according to T. Hani Handoko, organizing is a process and activity for determining the resources and activities needed to achieve organizational goals, designing and developing an organization or workgroup that can bring these things towards goals, assigning certain responsibilities, and delegating the necessary authority to individuals to carry out their duties. This function creates a formal structure in which work is defined, divided, and coordinated (Rachman, 2015). Organizing is one of the steps taken after planning. This step is taken to regulate the types of work in which the placement of workers is adjusted to their respective skills, both allocating personal tasks that carry out work where each individual has work assignments later and spending the funds needed when producing tofu. In carrying out the Economic Recovery program, the people in the educational tourism villages know that there is a need to reorganize the organizations or institutions involved in the program. Therefore, they focused on dealing with economic control and recovery due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This organizing activity includes organizing and compiling a new organizational structure within the ranks of tourism managers so that they are able to survive the mass of the pandemic and are able to generate almost passive tourism due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By organizing, all the necessary infrastructure and facilities are ready to use and ready to go according to what has been planned so that the tourist area is maintained and the community's economy is gradually improving. 3. Actuating  Actuating action is carrying out activity plans that have been agreed upon in concrete actions under their respective duties and authorities. After planning and organizing, the next action is to carry out the planning that has 28 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery been prepared earlier. The planning above states that one of the efforts to restore the economy in Kampung Tofu educational tourism is to make arrangements for the distribution of tofu according to market segmentation where this marketing step is carried out based on what has been planned from the start ( Hifsy & Neviyarni, 2022). The actions taken by the people in the tourist village are to carry out the tasks that have been given, including tourism managers who continue to think hard and innovate to re-exist the once triumphant Kampung Tahu by promoting through social media and promoting directly to educational institutions or schools in the Pekalongan Regency environment. In addition to the people who work as village tourism administrators, other people there are also taking action by switching professions affected by Covid-19 by trying other luck as casual laborers who have minimal risk due to the pandemic so that the community can restore their economy. 4. Controlling  This controlling activity is carried out to control all the progress of each work, to assist, as well as to check for errors which are then taken action. Policies in charge of making strategic decisions are responsible for the activities from planning to marketing to accelerate economic recovery in Kampung Tahu educational tourism due to a pandemic as well as economic recovery and economic transformation. It is done to minimize deviations from the standard and ensure that the goals set are achieved in the desired manner so that the production of tofu and the marketing of the educational tourism area will run smoothly and according to what has been intended. Apart from implementing POAC management in terms of economic recovery, residents of the tourist village work together to build a better economy after being low due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In Kampung Tahu educational tourism, the residents have a variety of jobs, such as tailors, traders, and wood processors. Also, the main thing is the tofu business. In mobilizing the economy of the village community, the concept used is people’s economics. The concept of a people’s economy is a concept of an economic instrument system found in Indonesia. According to Mohammad Hatta, the birth of this concept was motivated by the downturn that occurred in society, but when the concept of the people's economy was implemented, it was able to stand upright with the principle of mutual cooperation in building the economy (Effendi & Rustam, 2018). 29 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery The tourist village in Babalan Lor village applies the people’s economy as initiated by Mohammad Hatta. It is mutual cooperation in building educational tours of Kampung Tahu. Funds from the local government for the development of Kampung Tahu tourism have not discouraged the residents from managing and maintaining Kampung Tahu so it is always well maintained.  The economy in Kampung Tahu began to revive after the New Normal policy was announced by the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and after face-to-face learning activities were allowed again at school in Pekalongan Regency. It had a positive impact on tofu business and educational tour administrators in Kampung Tahu because as New Normal has helped to boost the world economy. Hence, the market demand for tofu has also gradually increased. Since the resumption of face-to-face activities in education, the market of educational tourism in Kampung Tahu has also begun to reopen. The educational tourism target in Kampung Tofu, Babalan Lor Village, is students who are in school as an educational tour about tofu processing. Kampung Tahu tourism administrators have also renovated the existing facilities with the village government's encouragement which provides a riverside as Kampung Tahu i-conic educational tour. To promote Kampung Tahu educational tourism, tour administrators also continue to advertise it on social media so that tourism and villages can be restored to the way they were before the pandemic broke out.  Conclusion  Kampung Tahu is an educational tourism village in Babalan Lor Village, Bojong District, Pekalongan Regency. This village was built due to assistance from the World Bank which was then supported by the central government. Thus, it was able to create an area with tourism potential and regional economic improvement. More or less, there were about 2 billion rupiahs in assistance from the government to help with the development, which makes Kampung Tahu a developed village. However, the community's economy was disrupted when the Covid-19 pandemic hit Indonesia. Previously, the majority of the residents were tofu makers, but many have stopped because of the decreasing income, and soybean prices have skyrocketed drastically. 30 | MUNAZZAMA : Journal of Islamic Management and Pilgrimage  Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2023 Implementation of Management Functions in Economic Recovery From the discussion regarding economic recovery in the tourist village of Babalan Lor Village, it can be concluded that the application of management functions and POAC principles greatly influenced the economic recovery in the tourist village of Babalan Lor Village due to Covid-19. In the past, almost the majority of people were tofu makers. However, the pandemic caused many of them to change professions, such as becoming merchants, opening a convection shop, and becoming laborers. Covid-19 also affected the tourism sector in Kampung Tahu which caused tourism to be completely closed due to social restrictions on a global scale. However, by implementing the management function and applying POAC principles in the New Normal era, all activities in the form of tofu production and the tourism sector have started to run normally. Even in the educational tourism sector, there have been some visits from schools in Pekalongan Regency. Also, there has been a gradual development of tourist areas in the form of facilities managed by the community in the tourist village of Babalan Lor Village, Bojong District.  References  Arianto, B.
