The first contribution is to growing literature examining the effects of business dynamism on regional resilience. Significant attention has, understandably, been paid to understanding why the impact of and recovery from the 2008 recession has varied across regions. Chapters 1 and 2 extend to the question of regional resilience a hypothesis that gross rates of local establishment openings, or “churn,” may affect local economic performance over a business cycle. In the US, higher-churn areas are found to experience faster average employment growth over the decade spanning the recession, but with more cyclical volatility. Churn is not positively correlated with median household income growth or poverty reduction at a county level. A novel cross-country analysis reveals that in the UK, local authorities with higher churn prior to the recession did weather the financial crisis slightly better, although data limitations restrict the direct comparability between the US and UK cases. Chapter 3 turns to the growth of self-employment in the US, motivated by two observations: first, that growth in the self-employment share has been regionally heterogeneous; and second, that theory suggests workers in wage-and-salary occupations exert limited agency over their working hours. This paper investigates whether average local working hours influence subsequent changes in the county self-employment share. I find a U-shaped relationship between working hours and self-employment growth: counties with working hours furthest from the mean experienced the fastest growth in local self-employment share, adding a new wrinkle to the running debate over whether the “gig economy” is driven by opportunity or necessity.iii DEDICATION    It is a great privilege and sincere joy to dedicate my work to so many people who have supported, encouraged, and inspired me: Savannah, my whole family, Stephan, my committee, and all the teachers from whom I have learned so much.

INTRODUCTION    Divergences in economic growth and labor market outcomes across regions of the US have emerged as pressing issues, especially during the 2008 recession and the uneven recovery that has followed. These papers address some under-recognized causes and consequences of stalled regional convergence, geographically heterogeneous growth, and the distributional impacts of recent labor market trends.  A burgeoning literature poses a causal relationship between entrepreneurial business dynamism and local employment growth. Consistent with this hypothesis, I find that US counties with higher rates annual openings and closures per existing business saw more rapid employment growth on average over a time period spanning the 2008 recession, but in an uneven fashion, with higher rates of openings and closures before the recession predicting worse initial employment losses followed by more robust recoveries. Strikingly, areas with higher rates of openings and closures during the 2004-2007 macroeconomic expansion performed no better in terms of median income growth during and after the recession, and worse in terms of poverty rates. Cumulatively these results suggest that while the average effect of dynamism on employment growth over longer time periods or during macroeconomic expansion appear to be positive, but with important caveats related to cyclical stability and income distribution.  The 2008 recession was not isolated to the US, causing significant disruption to economies around the world. A novel cross-country analysis of the time-varying effects of dynamism on growth across the recession and recovery for regions in the US and United Kingdom presents an informative comparison. The economies of these two countries share some commonalities – similar pre-recession trends in income and unemployment, for example – but notable structural differences including the foreign trade share of GDP, and health insurance 2  policies likely to have significant impacts on labor market decisions. I find the cyclical relationship between entrepreneurship and employment growth to be much less pronounced in UK local authorities than in US counties, providing evidence that institutions may interact with this effect in important ways. Concurrent with these changes, US labor markets have also been shaped by rising self-employment. Self-employment may be seen on one hand as a strength, with single-worker enterprises nimbly filling market niches; or as a sign of insufficient opportunities in wage-and-salary labor markets. Empirical findings presented in Chapter 3 support a hypothesis that much of this growth in self-employment may be driven by necessity rather than entrepreneurship, but with a noteworthy feature not previously identified in empirical literature: US regions with especially long or short average work weeks in wage-and-salary employment saw the greatest gains in the share of self-employed workers, suggesting that self-employment may be a more attractive alternative in regions where workers are either unable to find sufficient working hours or are pushed to work excessively long hours. These findings suggest important future work to untangle the implications of establishment churn and self-employment on local economic outcomes. Broadly, though, these results underscore the importance of a regional approach to the study of labor markets. Changes in employment, income, poverty, and self-employment vary substantially across the US and UK in ways masked by national statistics. Addressing persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and stagnation require a place-based approach.       3  2. THE MORE DYNAMIC THE BETTER? EFFECTS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON LOCAL GROWTH, DISTRIBUTION, AND RESILIENCE   2.1 Introduction Much has been written about the effects of entrepreneurship on economic outcomes. On the positive side of the ledger, young small businesses account for the majority of gross job creation in the US, generating direct benefits in terms employment and income. Entrepreneurship can be a source of innovation, driving growth-enhancing technological progress. Moreover, there is some evidence that even unsuccessful projects generate information spillovers that benefit other local producers. But entrepreneurship is also risky: fewer than half of all firms established in the US between 2008 and 2012 survived past five years. And if credit constraints limit entrepreneurial activity to the already-wealthy, or if local employment gains accrue largely to workers already in the upper end of income distributions, gains from even successful ventures are not guaranteed to be shared broadly. This paper focuses on the impacts of entrepreneurship on local economic performance. Theoretical and empirical findings suggest that even as transportation and telecommunication technologies improve, place continues to matter, perhaps more than ever. Agglomeration economies in terms of amenities, pooled labor forces, and information spillovers (Glaeser 2010, Bunten et al. 2014) play a crucial role in influencing the location decisions of firms and workers. Location also matters from a policy perspective. Consider for example a city or county faced with the decision of whether to offer $10 million in incentives to try to attract a large, established firm that would create virtually guaranteed jobs, or spend that same $10 million on developing a tech incubator, knowing that a large majority of ventures hatched there would likely fold before 4  ever hiring an employee. An informed decision requires an understanding of the effects of entrepreneurship on local economic outcomes. I posit that the effects of entrepreneurship on county-level economic outcomes are likely to vary across a macroeconomic business cycle. The logic of Schumpeter’s (1942) model of creative destruction suggests that during periods of macroeconomic expansion – during which any given local venture is more likely to succeed as a result of rising incomes and demand, exuberance in credit and financial markets, and other factors – counties with higher average rates of entrepreneurial activity will thrive. But when the macroeconomic business cycle peaks and declines, highly entrepreneurial areas will be hit hardest due to their concentrations of young establishments testing unproven business models and on unstable financial footing. The question of how entrepreneurial activity impacts local economic performance, and how these effects vary over time, has become especially pertinent in recent years for two reasons. First, income convergence across regions within the US, famously observed from 1890 to 1988 by Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1991), appears to have stalled. Over the past thirty years, rising house prices have driven flows of low-skilled workers out of high-wage, high-productivity areas, leading to increased inter-regional inequality and potential labor misallocation (Ganong and Shoag 2017).  Secondly, the 2008 recession had regionally heterogeneous effects. Some of this variation can be explained by factors such as sectoral composition of local employment (Bartik 1991) and household leverage (Mian and Sufi 2009). Based on the well-established link between entrepreneurship and economic growth in general, this paper examines the extent to which variations in the composition and dynamism of an area’s business ecosystem might help explain regionally divergent impacts of – and rates of recovery from – the Great Recession. 5  This paper measures the effects of entrepreneurial dynamism on local economic performance over a time period spanning the 2008 recession along a number of dimensions, using a county’s rate of establishment openings and closures relative to existing establishments in the years prior to the recession as a proxy for structural entrepreneurial capacity. First, consistent with existing empirical work on entrepreneurship and grounded in growth theory, I examine the effects of entrepreneurial dynamism on employment growth using a panel of US counties. A second set of specifications evaluates the impacts of dynamism on county median household income, shedding light on the types of jobs created by entrepreneurial activity. The percent of Americans living below the federal poverty line spiked during the recession and has been slow to decline; to this end, I evaluate effects of dynamism on county poverty rates. In each case, particular attention is paid to how effects of entrepreneurship on relevant local outcomes vary across the business cycle. Consistent with existing literature, dynamism is on average correlated with more rapid employment growth from 2004 to 2014. But these gains are uneven, with establishment turnover boosting job growth during the expansionary periods of 2003 to 2007 and 2012 to 2014, but correlated with more severe employment losses in 2008 and 2009. Beyond the employment effects, pre-recession dynamism has no positive effect on county median incomes during the 2008 recession and early recovery, and adverse effects on county poverty rates. This suggests that while entrepreneurship may correlate with net job growth, gains may not accrue evenly across the income distribution.  2.2 Motivation and Background – Entrepreneurship and Growth A recognition of the importance of entrepreneurship in the growth process dates back at least to Schumpeter's (1942) model of "creative destruction, later formalized by Aghion and Howitt (1990). Innovation in these models catalyzes endogenous growth by spurring 6  technological advancement. The extensive literature on human-capital-driven endogenous growth, typified by Krugman (1991), Lucas (1988), and Romer (1990), highlights the role of innovation in explaining differing economic outcomes across time and space. Measures of innovation and research networking (Strumsky and Thill, 2013) and entrepreneurial capital (Audretsch and Keilbach, 2004) have been shown empirically to boost local economic performance. Entrepreneurial dynamism may provide additional benefits in the form of information spillovers, especially at a local level. Akerlof (1978) posits that information asymmetries can hinder economic activity in a range of markets. Lang and Nakamura (1993) extend the logic of information asymmetry to a local scale, modeling mortgage lending decisions as a function of information generated by past loans in the same neighborhood. Bunten et al. (2014) provide evidence that knowledge spillovers from entrepreneurship contribute to subsequent employment growth prior to the 2008 recession using an instrumental variable approach.  But entrepreneurship also carries risk, not just for individual enterprises but also for areas with high concentrations of young firms. In Schumpeter’s (1942) business cycle model, entrepreneurial activity is responsible not only for the growth phase but also the decline, as the “bunching and swarming of imitators” drives up labor and capital prices, pushing late imitators out of business. Young ventures exhibit high attrition rates: according to BLS data, establishments opening in the US between 2008 and 2016 have an average one-year survival rate of 79%, while just under half survive for five years.  By most measures, entrepreneurial activity in the US has slowed markedly in recent years. Job creation from establishment births has been in decline since at least the early 2000s (Kacher and Weiler 2017). And as seen in figure 2.1 below, establishment openings and closures per 1000 employees have both fallen by about a fifth from their 1998 levels, and by more than a 7  quarter from their respective peaks. Recessions typically cause a temporary increase in closures with little impact on openings; this sustained decline in both openings and closures is unprecedented in the last half century (Kacher and Weiler 2017). Alon et al. (2017) find that the majority of firm productivity gains occur within its first five years of operation, meaning slowing rates of entry could have major negative implications for growth. As seen in figure 2.1 below, the rate of establishment openings and closures relative to existing establishments has fallen from a peak of 20.7% in 2001 to 17.5% in 2014.   Figure 2.1 This trend is also part of a broader pattern of declining dynamism. Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2013) note that the number of startups, young firms, and jobs created by young firms are all declining. Interstate migration has fallen since 2000 or earlier across virtually all age and demographic groups (Frey 2009, Molloy et al. 2011). Meanwhile, average job tenure has increased, meaning workers switch jobs less frequently (Hyatt and Speltzer 2016).  51015201998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014Openings ClosuresChurn: Openings + ClosuresEstablishment Openings and Closures as Percent of Existing Establishments8  There is some divergence within the existing literature as to how best to define and measure entrepreneurial activity. In some cases the ratio of small or young enterprises to total enterprises, or the rate of self-employment are used as proxies for entrepreneurship. These measures treat entrepreneurship as a stock variable, and operate under the assumption that smaller, sole-proprietor, and/or younger ventures are always more entrepreneurial, innovative, etc. than others. While this may be true on average (Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda 2013), it is at best an indirect measure. Instead, I measure entrepreneurship using annual establishment openings. Per the Census Statistics of US Businesses, an establishment “is a single physical location where business transactions take place and for which payroll and employment records are kept” which employs at least one person aside from the owner(s). Establishments may be companies (“single-unit enterprises”), or one location of a “multi-unit enterprise.”  The main measure of county-level dynamism used in this paper is gross establishment “churn,” measured as the annual percent of county establishment openings and closures relative to existing establishments. This definition is chosen first because the rates at which establishments enter and exit at a county level measures entrepreneurship as a flow measure, capturing dynamism rather than a stock of businesses fitting certain criteria. Second, counting establishment closures as well as openings captures the fact that entrepreneurship, especially in the Schumpeterian “creative destruction” sense, involves both the implementation of new ideas and the forcing out of less productive businesses.  This measure is similar in some ways to Bunten et al. (2014), who measure county-level dynamism by the product of establishment openings and closures per 1000 employees. Where the product of openings and closures applies a geometric fit to capture potential agglomeration 9  effects of dynamism, this paper uses a linear measure to avoid over-weighting counties with extreme values of openings and/or closures.  The measure used in this paper also differs from Bunten et al. (2014) in scaling openings and closures against existing establishments rather than employees. This is done partially for ease of interpretation; churn as the gross percentage of establishments opening and closing in a year is a conceptually simple measure, and easily replicable across different geographies. Measuring churn relative to existing establishments also adjusts for the fact that different counties may be home to smaller or larger establishments: on average, US counties over the time period studied here have roughly 25 employees per establishment, but with a standard deviation of 8.4.  To illustrate the implications of this, consider two hypothetical counties, each with 1000 residents. County A has 100 establishments (an employee-to-establishment ratio of 10:1) and County B has 10 establishments (an employee-to-establishment ratio of 100:1). Suppose one establishment opens in both of these counties. Weighting by 1000 employees, this change registers as an increase of 1 opening per 1000 employees in both counties. Weighting by existing establishments, this change is measured as 1% churn in County A and 10% churn in County B. This example is an extreme case, and in fact results are fairly similar using either definition. See Appendix 3 for a robustness check applying the definition of dynamism used in Bunten et al. (2014). It should be noted that the measure of churn employed here does not differentiate between stand-alone, potentially innovative establishment and establishments that are part of larger companies, the latter of which may seem less entrepreneurial. But even the act of replicating a proven business model in a new location is a risky venture, given uncertainty about local demand and factor markets. So while establishment openings and closures relative to 10  incumbents captures entrepreneurship indirectly, it measures county-level churn in a way consistent with the questions and hypotheses of this study. Figure 2.2 below depicts the geographic variation in average churn, measured from 2004-2014. Notably, churn is highest in the West, Mountain West and Gulf Coast, and lower through much of the Midwest and Rust Belt.  Figure 2.2  2.3 Regional Schumpeterian Cycles Existing theoretical and empirical inquiries into the entrepreneurship-growth link tend to look either at the long run, as in the macro models of Krugman (1991), Lucas (1988), and Romer (1990), or over a medium-to-short-run period of macroeconomic expansion; Bunten et al. (2014), for example, uses a first difference approach covering a time period running from 1998 to 2007.  How might the 2008 recession have impacted the relationship between entrepreneurship and growth? The impact of the recession on employment growth generally was drastic, as seen in figure 1.3. But the recession may also have had conflicting effects on entrepreneurship. On one hand, the crisis clearly generated credit constraints, stymieing some potential business creation 21.75 − 46.5519.72 − 21.7518.35 − 19.7217.23 − 18.3516.00 − 17.230.00 − 16.00No dataAverage Churn, 2004-201411  and growth (Duygan-Bump et al. 2016, Greenstone et al. 2014). In contrast, Fairlie (2013) posits that business closures and layoffs during the Great Recession may have encouraged newly-unemployed workers to consider entrepreneurial ventures, and finds that higher local unemployment rates increase the chances of an individual starting a business.    Figure 2.3 This paper explicitly tests the time-varying effects of entrepreneurship on regional outcomes. The hypothesis that impacts of entrepreneurial activity vary over the course of a macroeconomic business cycle stems for a regional interpretation of Schumpeter’s (1942) model of entrepreneurship-driven cyclicality. In Schumpeter’s seminal model, a (macroeconomic) expansion is spurred by “the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization that capitalist enterprise creates.” A cluster of new innovations sparks imitation, flooding the market with new products. A surge of firm entries is likely to drive a surge in productivity growth (Alon et al. 2017). Competition among firms vying for market share during this expansionary phase benefits consumers in the form of lower prices, but ultimately drives out of business some firms who entered the market too late or misjudged their investments. The initial surge of growth recedes and the economy returns to a new 12  equilibrium characterized by incrementally greater output, productivity, and technological capacity.  The term “creative destruction” is an apt description for this process: innovation makes obsolete some existing products and production methods, and on top of this many innovative (or imitative) ventures themselves fail. This model predicts boom and bust cycles of potentially dramatic proportions.  Although not made explicit in Schumpeter (1942), such business cycles are also likely to generate distributional inequality. Successful entrepreneurs undoubtedly profit from their successes, as do those they employ. Conversely, owners and employees of businesses that are driven out of business by new innovations, or that fail in an innovative venture, suffer income losses. These gains and losses are unlikely to be distributed randomly. Schumpeter waxes poetic about an innovative spirit as the driving force behind the entrepreneurial decision, but would-be innovators may face credit constraints. Blanchflower and Oswald (1998), for example, find that individuals who receive inheritances are far more likely to become entrepreneurs than those who don’t, suggesting that not everyone with innovative skill and passion has the opportunity to realize their vision. Additionally, workers with high human capital are likely to be better equipped to navigate the tumult of creative destruction. Galor and Zeira (1993) find that like entrepreneurship, human capital acquisition is credit-constrained, with wealthier individuals more able to afford the implicit and explicit costs of acquiring education and skills. The existence of credit constraints in terms of both entrepreneurship and human capital acquisition suggest that to the extent that entrepreneurial activity boosts average local economic performance, those gain may be unevenly distributed. Moreover, creative destruction may have outsized impacts on those lower on the income distribution, especially if these processes result in 13  at least temporary structural unemployment for lower-skilled workers. For these reasons, I estimate the effects of entrepreneurial dynamism not only on local employment growth, but also on median household income and the percent of county residents below the poverty line. Empirically, I apply this model on a regional scale, using county-level observations. While some innovations may be profound enough to have national ramifications, important components of the entrepreneurial process are inherently local. Entrepreneurs rely on location-specific information about markets for labor, inputs, and capital, as well as demand for final goods. Much of this information appears to come from observing the successes and failures of other ventures in close geographic proximity (Bunten et al. 2014). Agglomeration economies also allow nearby firms to benefit from pooled labor markets, consumers, and supply chains.  Macroeconomic forces also have disparate impacts of regional economies, due to factors such as local employment composition (Bartik 1991) and household debt (Mian and Sufi 2010). The regional impact of macroeconomic shocks can be dramatic, with long-lasting implications for employment and labor force participation, sometimes even stimulating industry restructuring (Blanchard and Katz 1992). How might an area’s degree of entrepreneurial dynamism impact its susceptibility to macroeconomic forces? On one hand, a dynamic local economy, in which struggling establishments are routinely replaced by new ones, might be well prepared to handle the tumult of a national recession. In contrast, Kitsos and Bishop (2018) find that in the UK, areas with more enterprise openings prior to the 2008 recession suffered larger employment declines during the crisis, presumably because such areas have more young firms that are vulnerable to recessions.  These two possibilities are not necessarily at odds with one another: in conjunction they suggest that areas with high entrepreneurial dynamism may suffer greater initial shocks at the 14  onset of a macroeconomic crisis, but subsequently recover more quickly and robustly. Entrepreneurial dynamism is persistent over time at the county level, suggesting that areas with high dynamism prior to a recessionary period generally also exhibit high dynamism during recoveries. Thus local entrepreneurial activity might both expose an area to greater risk during a macroeconomic downturn, but also aid in recovery. 2.4 Theory and Graphical Analysis The above theoretical discussion can be distilled into the following hypotheses: 1) Entrepreneurial dynamism is generally growth-enhancing at a county level, with higher rates of establishment turnover sparking innovation, generating productivity-enhancing information spillovers, and attracting creative workers. 2) Gains from entrepreneurial dynamism may not be widely distributed, instead captured mainly by entrepreneurs themselves and by workers with high human capital. Both entrepreneurship and human capital acquisition are likely subject to credit constraints and therefore less available to less wealthy individuals. 3) Regional effects of entrepreneurial dynamism may vary across a business cycle. Specifically, in the case of the 2008 recession, more dynamic areas are expected to suffer worse initial downturns due to their higher concentrations of young establishments, but enjoy stronger recoveries due to the persistence of dynamism rates over time. These hypotheses suggest that entrepreneurial dynamism may generate regional employment growth (at least during macroeconomic expansions) but might not boost local outcomes for those lower on the income distribution. To test this, I model three county-level dependent variables: employment growth, changes in median household income, and changes in the percent of residents below the poverty line. 15   Employment growth is a conventional measure used in much of the existing regional growth literature, as it captures both increases in the local employment and/or labor force participation rate as well as net in-migration. Employment measures are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis Total Employment data.   County median household income measures one element of the distribution of gains from entrepreneurship-led growth. Median income is unaffected by right-tail skewness, meaning that if entrepreneurship creates substantial benefits for a small group, e.g. venture capitalists, managers, or the entrepreneurs themselves, median wage will show little to no increase. Entrepreneurship-driven growth boosts median incomes at the county level only if ventures directly or indirectly boost incomes earned by households in the lower half of the income distribution.   Annual estimates of county-level poverty are obtained from the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE), a Census program used to allocate federal education funding. While SAIPE poverty estimates are not a comprehensive survey, data is drawn from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, making this the most reliable annual county-level data on poverty. Figure 2.4 below presents suggestive evidence of a relationship between dynamism that motivates this analysis. Counties are categorized into quartiles based on their average churn from 2007 to 2014. The figure plots unweighted county average employment relative to 1998, by dynamism quartile. Albeit without controls or an econometric structure suggesting identification, counties with higher rates of dynamism enjoy noticeably larger employment gains prior to 2008 and slightly faster growth from 2011 on, but more rapid employment declines in 2009. 16   Figure 2.4 The median income growth trajectories of counties with high and low rates of pre-recession churn exhibit less divergence. Highly dynamic counties exhibit slightly more rapid income growth during the expansionary period from 2005 to 2007, and slower income gains during the recovery, but differences are less pronounced than in the case of employment growth.  Figure 2.5  Similarly, counties with the highest rate of churn during the 2004-2007 expansion saw marginally better performance in terms of poverty rates prior to the recession, but experienced slightly faster increases in poverty rates from 2008-2012. -4-2024Employment Growth (%)2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014Lowest Quartile Highest QuartileQuartiles by Gross Percent of Establishment Openings and Closures, 2004-2007Percent Annual Employment Growth by Pre-Recession Churn-20246Change in Median Household Income (%)2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014Lowest Quartile Highest QuartileQuartiles by Gross Percent of Establishment Openings and Closures, 2004-2007By Pre-Recession ChurnPercent Annual Change in Median Household Income17   Figure 2.6 2.5 Empirical Analysis             While visual evidence of the effects of dynamism on regional outcomes is compelling, it should be noted that the figures above do not include controls, which are likely of great importance to regional changes in employment, median income, and poverty rates. The empirical analysis that follows incorporates a range of county-year controls. The ratio of nonemployer establishments to employees, the ratio of employees to total population, and the natural log of total employment help capture current labor market conditions. Nonemployer establishments, defined by the US Census as business ventures earning at least $1000 per year but with no employees besides the owner/proprietor(s), signal potential future employment growth, as roughly 10% to 30% of nonemployer establishments eventually hire employees (Moore 2018, Acs et al. 2009, Davis et al. 2009), and even those that don’t may still enhance local productivity by generating information spillovers, identifying and exploiting niches that other firms may capitalize on. The employment-to-population ratio captures slack in the labor market, in that an area with a lower employment-population ratio might have more workers ready to fill newly-created jobs in the short run. The log of lagged employment accounts for the possibility that the -.50.511.52004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014Lowest Quartile Highest QuartileQuartiles by Gross Percent Establishment Openings and Closures, 2004-2007By Pre-Recession ChurnPercentage-Point Annual Change in Poverty Rate18  effects of entrepreneurship on local economic outcomes might depend in part simply on the size of the local labor market. An annual measure of rent-to-median income serves as a proxy for affordability regional affordability. Housing costs are accounting for an increasingly large share of American incomes (Anthony 2018), which has two important implications for this model. First, high and/or rising housing costs are expected to impact workers’ location decisions. If housing prices rise when dynamism increases, the employment gains of entrepreneurship will be diminished as lack of affordable housing slows the job match process. Secondly, high rents might make directly inhibit entrepreneurship, with workers in high-rent areas left with less disposable income to start a venture, and more dire consequences if the venture fails. Two measures of industry employment composition are also included. The first is a specialization index, which captures the concentration or dispersion of employment across sectors. Counties with higher concentrations face potentially wider cyclical variations, as a demand shock to a sectors that employs a large share of a county’s population will result in a disproportionate employment effect. The second employment measure is a demand shock variable modeled on Bartik (1991) that predicts county employment growth based on national employment growth rates by sector. Since regions have differing employment concentrations in different industries, a national demand shock for a particular good will have heterogeneous impacts on regional labor markets. Predicted annual employment growth in county i is calculated by scaling the number of workers in county i employed in sector j in time t by the national employment growth rate in sector j from t to t+1, where the j sectors are defined at the 6-digit NAICS level. The resulting demand shock can be interpreted as predicted annual employment growth in county i based on county i's sectoral specialization in the current year.   19  Recognizing the likely correlation of unobserved county-specific factors over time, I apply a fixed-effects panel model, with standard errors clustered at the county level. Additionally, I implement state-year fixed effects to account for state policy variations. Variable descriptions, summary statistics, and correlations from 2004 to 2014 are displayed below.

Over this business cycle, a one-standard-deviation increase in gross churn predicts a one-half-percent higher average annual employment growth rate. Larger counties, counties with a higher density of nonemployer establishments, and counties with lower median rent to median income ratios also see faster job gains. This effect is noticeably weaker in predicting changes in median income and poverty rates. As seen in table 2.4, while the effect of churn on median income growth is positive and statistically significant over this time period, the effect is not economically meaningful: all else equal, a county with churn one standard deviation above the mean sees median wages rise only 0.04% faster per year than a county with average churn. The most economically significant factors predicting median wage growth are tighter labor markets, i.e. higher employment-population ratios, and the Bartik demand measure, which predicts local demand growth based on local employment profiles and national sectoral job growth trends. Likewise, while average churn has a statistically significant negative correlation with changes in poverty rates over this time period, a standard deviation increase in churn predicts less than a thousandth-percentage point decrease in poverty rates. These average effects of churn on employment growth over time are fairly well-established in existing literature, and say little about this paper’s main contribution, which is the time-varying relationship between churn and growth suggested by a regional interpretation of Schumpeter’s business cycle. To explicitly examine this time-varying effect, I use an annual fixed-effects panel of US counties spanning 2004 to 2014. The estimating equation takes the general form: !#,6 = %& + %(78,9 + 	%:78,9 ∗ <ℎ>9+#,:&&?@:&&A + %BCD,D8 ∗ 78,9 + 		2%3#,6@( + E6 + F#+ 4#,6 24  The outcome variables, yit are annual percentage changes in employment in the first set of specifications, median household income in the second, and poverty rates in the third. The independent variable of interest is the interaction between pre-recession churn and a year fixed effect. Because churn is strongly correlated within counties over time, I treat a county’s average level of churn from 2004-2007 as a proxy for its pre-recession level of dynamism. (As a robustness check, I also employ a measure of average churn over the full 2004-2014 time period; these two measures have a correlation coefficient of 0.64, and the choice of measure does not significantly impact results. See Appendix 2) This interaction term shows the marginal effect of a percentage point increase in pre-recession churn in a particular year relative to 2004.  One-year-lagged county-specific controls 3#,6@( include all variables outlined in Table 1, as well as separate one-year-lagged measures of establishment openings and closures per 1000 workers, which adjust for the direct job creation and destruction effects of establishment creation and destruction. To capture state-level policy differences such as tax rates and business regulations, I employ state-year fixed effects. Results are presented below in Table 2.6, and in a plot of churn-times-year marginal effects from specification II in figure 2.7.

This aligns with the theoretical framework of regional Schumpeterian cycles: during the macroeconomic boom prior to 2007, when credit was freely available and incomes, both actual and expected, were rising, highly dynamic counties reaped the greatest benefits. During this expansionary macroeconomic climate, risky ventures were more likely to succeed – nationally, establishments born in 2002 enjoyed a 60% three-year survival rate, compared to 56.5% for those that opened in 2008. Counties with higher churn in the years prior to the 2008 recession saw more severe job growth slowdowns in 2008 and 2009. But by about 2013, higher rates of pre-recession establishment churn again predicted more rapid employment gains. The relationship between pre-recession churn and growth in local median incomes is similar during the early-2000s boom and the onset of the crisis, with more dynamic counties experiencing faster income growth prior to 2008 and more severe income losses during the -4-3-2-10123452005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Marginal Effects - % Change in Pre-Recession Churn on % Employment Growth27  macroeconomic downturn. But whereas counties with higher pre-recession churn saw more rapid employment growth during the recovery, a parallel trend does not emerge for median income growth; instead, higher pre-recession churn predicts slightly slower median income growth in 2012 and 2014.

Full results reported in Column II of Table 2.7. 2.6 Discussion and Conclusions             This paper seeks to shed light on the relationship between entrepreneurial activity and growth at a regional level. I find a positive relationship between average dynamism and average employment growth over a 16-year period that spans the recessions of 2001 and 2008, in line with existing literature. The novel finding presented here is that effects of entrepreneurship on growth appear to vary across the business cycle. Since the early 2000’s counties in the US with high rates of entrepreneurship, measured by the rate of establishment turnover, enjoy more rapid employment growth during periods of macroeconomic expansion and suffer more severe ill effects of recessions. Further, pre-recession rates of establishment churn appear to have negative ramifications for median incomes and poverty during the recession.             These results can be better understood through a regional interpretation of the Schumpeterian growth cycle. In Schumpeter’s model, risky, innovative activity sets off a boom-and-bust cycle with a general upwards trend. If such cycles occur locally as well as nationally, it follows that regions with higher rates of entrepreneurial activity should see more pronounced -0.50.00.51.01.52.02.52005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Marginal Effects - % Change in Pre-Recession Churn on % Change in Poverty Rate29  business cycles. The finding that higher establishment turnover rate – whether measured on an annual basis or as an average across a longer period – correlates with better faster employment growth during macroeconomic expansions and slower growth during recessions aligns with this prediction. The negative effects of pre-recession churn on median incomes and poverty rates during the recession strongly suggest that the impacts of “creative destruction” are not felt evenly across the income distribution. While higher churn does correlate with more rapid average employment growth over the course of a business cycle, the bulk of the negative effects of the recession seem to be felt by those at or below the middle of the income distribution.             From a policy perspective, the findings in this paper might be interpreted as providing a mixed endorsement of entrepreneurship-promotion as a development strategy. On one hand, the positive medium-run relationship between dynamism and employment growth is hard to ignore, and the faster and more robust employment recovery from the 2008 recession experienced by the most dynamic quartile of counties is undoubtedly a feat many local areas would like to replicate. At a minimum, the above results should help allay fears that low survival rates among young establishments means entrepreneurship is too risky to be feasibly promoted at a local level. Yet volatility in employment growth across the business cycle is the antithesis of the steady, sustained job gains that best allow local policy-makers to make accurate longer-range projections about revenue and expenditures. Moreover, the positive effects of average pre-recession churn on median income growth evident before the crisis have yet to re-emerge, and at no point over this business cycle does churn correlate with decreased poverty rates, raising questions about the distributional impacts of churn-driven local growth.             What this work does suggest is that local decision-makers may benefit from considering how best to distribute potential net gains from entrepreneurial activity, both across time and across the income distribution. Temporal smoothing may entail using tax revenues generated 30  during boom periods to mitigate ill-effects of future recessions, while ex-post income redistribution measures or poverty-reduction programs might complement policies supporting entrepreneurship.              This paper also raises a number of important questions. Perhaps the most pressing is the extent to which different kinds of entrepreneurial activity generate different regional effects. I use a broad measure of entrepreneurship that captures openings and closures of any business establishment. Does dynamism in particular sectors have distinct effects? Even more pertinent to matters of distribution: does the race, gender, or socio-economic status of the entrepreneur matter? Each of these topic merits future work to better understand the complex relationship between entrepreneurial dynamism and sustainable, equitable regional well-being.              31  3. ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RESILIENCE IN THE US AND UK: IMPLICATIONS FOR REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT   3.1 Introduction Much has been written about the effects of entrepreneurship on local economic outcomes. On the positive side of the ledger, young small businesses account for substantial portions of gross job creation, creating direct benefits in terms employment and income. Moreover, there is some evidence that even unsuccessful projects generate information spillovers that benefit other local producers. But entrepreneurship is also risky. Fewer than half of all firms established in the US between 2008 and 2012 survived past five years. In the UK, 44% of enterprises established in 2011 were still in operation in 2016 (Office for National Statistics 2017). This paper focuses on a particular aspect of the relationship between entrepreneurship1 and local economic performance: resilience to macroeconomic recessions. It has been well-documented that the Great Recession of 2008 had regionally heterogeneous effects within and between areas in affected countries (Faggian et al., 2018; Kitsos & Bishop, 2018). Some of this                                                         1 A Note on Terminology: For the purposes of this paper, entrepreneurship in the US is measured using establishment openings and closures, as used in Bunten et al. (2014). Per the Census Statistics of US Businesses, an establishment “is a single physical location where business transactions take place and for which payroll and employment records are kept” which employs at least one person aside from the owner(s). Establishments may be companies (“single-unit enterprises”), or one location of a “multi-unit enterprise.” Although many establishments are part of larger companies, we feel that establishment openings and closures reflect entrepreneurial activity because even the act of replicating a proven business model in a new location is a risky venture.   For the UK, Office for National Statistics Business Demography data are used to derive the firm opening and closure information for local authority regions. The data comes from the Inter-Departmental Business Register and identifies companies that are register and de-register for Value Added Tax (VAT) and/or Pay As You Earn (PAYE). A comparison of observation entries and exits between periods leads to the formation of the Business Demography dataset. Since VAT and PAYE are registered at the enterprise level, the UK model captures entrepreneurial activity at the level of the firm rather than the establishment.  32  variation can be explained by factors such as sectoral composition of local employment and household leverage (Mian and Sufi 2009).  However, little attention has been paid on the role of entrepreneurship on economic resilience. The limited studies so far (Kitsos & Bishop, 2018; Rocchetta & Mina, 2017) do not find any of the positive employment effects associated to entrepreneurship during a period of turbulence such as the 2008 crisis. These studies predominantly use firm births and consider the entirety of the 2008 downturn as one period. This study introduces two novelties in this sense. Our key measure of entrepreneurial activity is “dynamism,” which captures the gross rate at which business ventures turn over. We separate the post-2008 period into individual years that can better reflect the downturn and recovery period. Consequently, we examine whether a locality’s rate of entrepreneurial “dynamism” in the years prior to 2008 impacts its performance during the crisis and recovery in a different manner.  Additionally, we conduct analyses using both counties in the US and local authorities in the UK. Although data differences between the two countries impose some limitations on comparability between the US and UK cases, this approach extends existing national-level literature by offering insights into international variation in the effects of the Great Recession. Our results support the broad finding, well established in both theoretical and empirical literature, that entrepreneurial dynamism contributes to local economic growth on average. However, our findings highlight some important nuances in this relationship. Theory suggests that areas with high levels of pre-recession entrepreneurial activity may have a greater density of young establishments on unstable footing and thus suffer harsher downturns, but that high entrepreneurial capacity might allow these areas to recover more quickly. Consistent with theoretical predictions, in both the US and UK, areas with high pre-recession entrepreneurial 33  activity recover from the crisis more quickly and robustly, experiencing significantly higher rates of employment growth in 2013 and 2014. During the recession years of 2009 to 2011, however, US counties with high pre-recession dynamism suffer more severe growth slowdowns, while in the UK, pre-recession entrepreneurial activity has little bearing on the severity of the initial shock. 3.2 Context – Macroeconomic and Labor Market Conditions in the US and UK  In some respects the 2008 recession had similar macroeconomic implications for the two countries in this analysis. In both the US and UK, GDP growth averaged roughly 3% during 2002-2007 expansion, then declined precipitously in 2008 and 2009 before returning to roughly 2% by 2012. UK GDP decreased slightly more than the US during the recession. Unemployment rates rose in both countries. US unemployment peaked at a higher level, just shy of 10% compared to 8% in the UK.  Figure 3.1: GDP growth in the US and UK. Source: World Bank  34   Figure 3.2: unemployment rates in the US and UK. Source: World Bank   Several structural differences between the US and UK economies should be noted. Institutions related to health care and health insurance differ starkly between the two countries, with American health insurance tied largely to employment status, while the UK National Health System provides comprehensive tax-payer-funded health services at little to no cost to users. Employer-proved health insurance has been identified as a source of “job lock” among US workers (Madrian 1994), and could significantly impact decisions related to entrepreneurial activity.   Figure 3.3: domestic private health expenditure, percent of current health expenditure, in the US and UK. Source: World Bank  35  Pertinent to the present research question, rates of and trends in business openings and closures also differ between the two countries, as well as the ways in which openings and closures are measured. Entrepreneurship in the US is measured using establishment openings and closures, as used in Bunten et al. (2014). Per the Census Statistics of US Businesses, an establishment “is a single physical location where business transactions take place and for which payroll and employment records are kept” which employs at least one person aside from the owner(s). Establishments may be companies (“single-unit enterprises”), or one location of a “multi-unit enterprise.” Although many establishments are part of larger companies, we feel that establishment openings and closures reflect entrepreneurial activity because even the act of replicating a proven business model in a new location is a risky venture. For the UK, Office for National Statistics Business Demography data are used to derive the firm opening and closure information for local authority regions. The data comes from the Inter-Departmental Business Register and identifies companies that are register and de-register for Value Added Tax (VAT) and/or Pay As You Earn (PAYE). A comparison of observation entries and exits between periods leads to the formation of the Business Demography dataset. Since VAT and PAYE are registered at the enterprise level, the UK model captures entrepreneurial activity at the level of the firm rather than the establishment. These data sources provide an imperfect comparative measure of entrepreneurial activity between the US and UK for two reasons. First, US measures are at the establishment level, while UK figures capture openings and closures of enterprises. Secondly, UK data has important limitations. Per the Office of National Statistics: “VAT registrations and de-registrations are the best official guide to the pattern of business start-ups and closures... These figures do not, however, give the complete picture of start-up and closure activity in the economy. Some VAT exempt sectors and businesses 36  operating below the threshold for VAT registration are not covered. At the start of 2006, the VAT threshold was an annual turnover of £60,000 [roughly US$76,000 by current exchange rates], and 1.9 million of the estimated 4.5 million enterprises in the UK were VAT-registered. However, some businesses do voluntarily register for VAT even though their turnover is below the threshold. Data for 2006 shows that around a fifth of all registrations have turnover below the VAT threshold.” The threshold for VAT registration had increased to £81,000, approximately US$103,000 by 2014.  UK openings and closures may, accordingly, capture some larger nonemployer ventures, which are not included in the US data – for reference, the average US nonemployer establishment earned roughly US$47,000 in receipts over the time period in this study - and may fail to capture some small employer enterprises. To maintain the greatest consistency possible between US and UK data, two measures of dynamism are employed: the product of openings and closures per 1000 workers, following Bunten et al. (2014), and the gross percent of establishment or enterprise openings and closures relative to existing businesses. The latter is featured in main results for two reasons: first, it employs a linear rather than quadratic fit, putting less weight on localities with extreme values. Second, it allows for greater comparability between the business dynamics of the two countries. Figures 3
