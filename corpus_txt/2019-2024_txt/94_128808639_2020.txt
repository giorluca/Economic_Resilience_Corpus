Hennebry Athlone Institute of Technology, Athlone, Ireland; bhennebry@ait.ieABSTRACTRelevance. Much research was undertaken on regional economic resilience after the financial crisis of 2008. The current crisis caused by Covid19 provides an opportunity to understand further the nature of regional economic resilience. It also provides an opportunity to analyse the urban-rural divide of economic resilience for two recessions. Research objective. There are two main objectives of this study Firstly, to understand if resilience to one recession provides a good indication of resilience to a subsequent recession. The second aim is to under-stand the urban-rural differences in regional economic resilience in Ireland. Data and methods. This is a quantitative study which uses data from the Irish Central Statistics Office regarding unemployment and population distribution. To understand economic resilience a sensitivity index is used and to check for correlation the Pearson coefficient is used. Results. Results show that there is no correlation between resilience to the financial crisis and resilience to the Covid19 crisis. Population distribution was not a determinant of resilience to the financial crisis. However, population distribution was a determinant of resilience to the Covid19 crisis. Counties with high population in ‘independent urban towns’ or ‘rural areas with moderate urban influence’ were more resilient while counties with high population in ‘satellite urban towns’ or ‘rural areas with high urban influence’ were more vulnerable. Conclusions. Economic resilience to one re-cession is not a good indication of resilience to future recessions. Counties with population in urban centres or more reliant on urban areas were less resilient to the Covid19 crisis.KEYWORDSregional economic resilience; urban-rural divide; Ireland; Covid19; recessionACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Skłodowska Curie grant agreement number 721999.FOR CITATIONHennebry, B.

После финансового кризиса 2008 года было проведено много исследований устойчивости региональной экономики. Нынешний кризис, вызванный Covid19, дает возможность лучше понять природу устойчивости экономики региона. Это также дает возможность проана-лизировать разрыв между городом и деревней в устойчивости экономи-ки к  двум рецессиям. Цель исследования. Это исследование преследует две основные цели. Во-первых, понять, является ли устойчивость к одной рецессии хорошим показателем устойчивости к последующей рецессии. Вторая цель – понять различия между городом и деревней в региональной экономической устойчивости Ирландии. Данные и методы. Это количе-ственное исследование, в котором используются данные Центрального ста-тистического управления Ирландии о безработице и распределении насе-ления. Для понимания экономической устойчивости используется индекс чувствительности, а для проверки корреляции – коэффициент Пирсона. Полученные результаты. Результаты показывают, что нет никакой кор-реляции между устойчивостью к финансовому кризису и устойчивостью к кризису Covid19. Распределение населения не было определяющим фак-тором устойчивости к финансовому кризису.

Much research was carried out regarding the theoretical underpinnings of resilience (Sim-mie & Martin, 2010; Lang, 2012; Martin, 2012; Tóth, 2015) and empirical research was done to understand the determinants of resilience. One shortcoming of this research was that it focused on a single recession and it is unclear if the deter-minants of resilience in face of the financial crisis would also be factors in determining resilience for any future recession. The contraction of the economy from Covid19 now provides us with an opportunity to understand if regions which were resilient in light of the financial crisis are also re-silient in terms of the Covid19 crisis.There is some indication that urban centres and more accessible regions were more resilient to the financial crisis (ESPON, 2014; Lapuh, 2018) and that there was an urban-rural divide in terms of the recovery (Hennebry, 2018). It will be inte- resting to see if there is an urban-rural divide in relation to the Covid19 crisis also. Thus, this pa-per has two research questions:1) Were Irish counties that were resilient during the financial crisis of 2008 also resilient during the Covid19 crisis?2) Is there an urban-rural divide in terms of regional economic resilience for Irish counties?This paper focuses on Ireland as it provides an interesting case study. Ireland was one of the European countries worst affected by the finan-cial crisis. It was labelled as one of the ‘PIIGS’ countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain), an acronym used for the countries that suffered the worst recessions in Europe. Howe-ver, Ireland did recover strongly from the fi-nancial crisis (Hennebry, 2018). Ireland’s reco- very from the financial crisis has been studied (Fitzgerald, 2014; Ruane, 2016), especially the regional aspect of the recovery (Morgenroth, 2014; Breathnach et al., 2015). Ireland has also been affected by rising unemployment due to the Covid19 crisis, the number of people on the live register or claiming the pandemic unemploy-ment payment (PUP) increased by more than three times between February and April 2020 (Central Statistics Office).The Irish government has responded by intro-ducing some new income support measures. The government introduced a wage subsidy scheme, which will subsidise up to 70% of employee in-come (capped at €410 a week) for all firms in sec-tors that have seen a 25% fall in revenue. They have also introduced the PUP of €350 a week for employees or self-employed people who have lost their jobs due to the Covid19 crisis (Central Bank of Ireland, 2020).Theoretical BasisThe theoretical background for studying re-silience in terms of regional economics is rela- tively new and therefor regional economists tend to borrow the definition of ‘resilience’ from other fields of study (Martin & Sunley, 2015). These can be divided into three broad groups and are summarised in table 1. The first definition comes from engineering and considers resilience to be the speed at which an economy returns to equilibrium (Holling, 1996), this is generally ac-cepted by the neoclassical school of thought in economics as it sees an economy as only having a single equilibrium point. The second definition comes from ecological science and defines resi- lience as an economy’s ability to absorb shocks before altering its structure (Holling, 1973). This sees an economy as having several equilib-rium points and is therefore seen as complying with the Keynesian school of thought (Davoudi, 2012). The third definition comes from psycho-logical sciences and organisational theory and sees resilience as an economy’s ability to adapt in anticipation of, or response to, shocks. This defi-nition suits an evolutionary economics approach 148 https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economyR-ECONOMY, 2020, 6(3), 146–153 doi: 10.15826/recon.2020.6.3.012Online ISSN 2412-0731as it considers the possibility of many equilib-rium points and these points change over time (Berkes & Folke, 1998).Table 1Definitions of ResilienceField of Study Definition Equilibrium PointsSchool of ThoughtEngineering Speed of return to equilibriumOnly one equilibrium pointNeoclas-sicalEcological scienceAbility to absorb shocks before altering its structureSeveral equilibrium pointsKeynesianPsychological sciences and organisational theoryAbility to adapt in anticipation of, or response to, shocksEquilibrium points change over timeEvolutio- nary Eco-nomicsSource: Authors own workThe most accepted definition of resilience in regional economics comes from Martin and Sun-ley (2015, p. 13) and attempts to blend the three above definitions. They define resilience as:“the capacity of a regional or local economy to withstand or recover from market, competitive and environmental shocks to its developmental growth path, if necessary by undergoing adaptive changes to its economic structures and its social and institutional arrangements, so as to maintain or restore its previous developmental path, or transit to a new sustainable path characterized by a fuller and more productive use of its physical, human and environmental resources.”There have been many empirical studies on the determinants of regional economic resilience. Dokic et al. (2016), focusing on Croatia, found that the recession led to increasing regional dis-parities and that construction and trade were the most important determinants of resilience. For regions in Italy, cultural behaviours have been shown to contribute to regional resilience (Cel-lini and Cuccia, 2019). Lapuh (2018) found that for municipalities in Slovenia important deter-minants of resilience included regions being ex-port orientated, densely populated, and having a well-educated work force.There have been a number of studies done focusing specifically on resilience of cities and urban regions (Simmie, 2017; Tan & et al., 2017; Martin & Gardiner, 2019) but much less research has been done focusing specifically on rural re-gions. Sánchez-Zamora et al. (2014) focus spe-cifically on rural regions in the Andalusia region of Spain and find that economic diversification is important for building resilience. They also found that employment in agriculture is good for resi- lience as it acts as a ‘haven sector’ during reces-sions. Hennebry (2020) analyses the determinants of economic resilience for rural regions in Portu-gal and also finds that agriculture has a positive impact on resilience.This paper will add to the literature of re-gional resilience by examining the correlation between resilience to the financial crisis and resi- lience to the Covid19 crisis for counties in Ire-land. It will also analyse how population distribu-tion of Irish counties impacts regional resilience.Methods and DataThis study focuses on Ireland, which consists of 26 counties (i.e. the six counties of Northern Ireland are not included). The data in this study comes from Ireland’s Central Statistics Office1. When referring to unemployment it is in refer-ence to the number of people on the ‘Live Re- gister’ and people in receipt of the PUP. The ‘Live Register’ refers to people that are registered for unemployment assistance. The PUP is an addi-tional payment introduced to help people who lost their jobs due to the Covid19 crisis.The data for ‘Population Distribution’ comes from the 2016 census, also available from the cen-tral statistics office. It divides the residence of the population into six categories: cities, satellite ur-ban towns, independent urban towns, rural areas with high urban influence, rural areas with mo- derate urban influence and highly rural/remote areas. A table showing the percentage of people residing in each category for all counties is pro-vided in the appendix.There are numerous ways to measure regional economic resilience (Ringwood et al., 2018). The method used for this paper will be similar to the employment sensitivity index proposed by Martin (2012):,UnCUnCUnNUnN∆β =∆ (1)where UnC is unemployment in the county, and UnN is unemployment in the nation. This formula compares the change in number of people unem-ployed in a county to the change in the number of people unemployed in the whole nation. A result of greater than 1 would indicate that a region is 1 Available from https://www.cso.ie/en/databases/R-ECONOMY, 2020, 6(3), 146–153 doi: 10.15826/recon.2020.6.3.012149 https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economyOnline ISSN 2412-0731more vulnerable to changes in the national econo-my, i.e. the number of unemployed increased more than proportionately in the county com-pared to the nation. While a score of less than 1 would signify that a region is relatively resilient, that is to say, the number of people unemployed in the county increased by a smaller proportion than the nation’s unemployment as a whole. In contrast to Martin (2012), who used a single time period for the peak and trough for all regions, this paper uses a method similar to Sensier and Ar-tis (2014). In their work, Sensier and Artis (2014) used a more flexible method that allows for dif-ferent start points and end points for the reces-sion in each region. We consider the start point of the recession to be the month with the lowest unemployment and the end point of the recession is considered to be the month with the highest unemployment.To check for correlation, we use the Pearson correlation method. This is a bivariate method and “was the first formal correlation measure, and it is still the most widely used measure of re-lationship” (Rodgers & Nicewander, 1988, p. 61). It is suitable for quantitative variables and is a “measure of the strength of the linear relation-ship between two such variables” (Hauke & Kos-sowski, 2011, p. 88). ResultsThe first goal of this research was to under-stand if there was a correlation between econo-mic resilience to the Covid19 crisis and eco-nomic resilience to the financial crisis. For that reason, the sensitivity index described above was calculated for all 26 counties in Ireland in response to both recessions. The results are pre-sented in table 2. The Pearson correlation method was used to check if there was a correlation between eco-nomic resilience to the Covid19 crisis and eco-nomic resilience to the financial crisis. We can see examples above of counties that were resi- lient to both (e.g. Waterford) and counties that were vulnerable to both (e.g. Meath), however the Pearson coefficient is 0.29 with a P-value of 0.15. This means that the result is statistically in-significant i.e. counties which were resilient to the financial crisis were not necessarily resilient to the Covid19 crisis.The geographic distribution of the sensitivity index in relation to the Covid19 crisis is presented in figure 1. It is hard to see any clear geograph-ic pattern in the resilience to the Covid19 crisis. This is in contrast to the geographic distribution of the sensitivity index in relation to the financial crisis (shown in figure 2). For the financial cri-sis the vulnerable counties were those that were close in proximity to Dublin, even though Dub-lin itself was not vulnerable. The resilient counties were those on the west of the country. One inter-esting comparison is the lack of strong resilience for counties during the financial crisis compared with the Covid19 crisis. For the financial crisis no county showed strong resilience (a sensitivity score of less than 0.75). However, there are eight counties that have shown strong resilience to the Covid19 crisis.Table 2Sensitivity Index in relation to Covid19 crisis and financial crisisResilience to Covid19 crisisResilience  to Financial CrisisCarlow 0.7158 1.3794Cavan 0.9424 1.2296Clare 0.9492 0.9011Cork 1.2563 1.0541Donegal 0.7382 0.8531Dublin 1.1671 0.9348Galway 1.0257 0.9266Kerry 0.8980 0.9679Kildare 1.0436 1.3652Kilkenny 1.0772 1.0436Laois 0.7114 1.7857Leitrim 0.7676 1.1852Limerick 0.9885 1.1074Longford 0.5811 0.9058Louth 0.7130 0.9183Mayo 0.7848 0.9907Meath 1.7714 1.5363Monaghan 1.0363 1.2883Offaly 0.7273 1.2126Roscommon 1.0418 1.2092Sligo 0.8909 1.1013Tipperary 0.7782 1.2212Waterford 0.6167 0.7611Westmeath 0.7809 0.9479Wexford 0.6874 1.0196Wicklow 1.0529 1.0988Source: Own calculations based on data from central sta-tistics office.150 https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economyR-ECONOMY, 2020, 6(3), 146–153 doi: 10.15826/recon.2020.6.3.012Online ISSN 2412-0731Economic Resilienceto Covid19Less than 0.750.75–1.001.00–1.25Greater than 1.250 25 50 kmFigure 1.

Economic resilience to financial crisisSource: Own calculations based on data from central  statistics officeThe next challenge was to see if the population distribution of a county had an effect on resilience. This was first done with respect to resilience to the Covid19 crisis and is presented in table 3. As can be seen, four of the variables had a statistically signifi-cant impact on economic resilience. The variables that showed to have a positive effect on resilience (i.e. a negative impact on the sensitivity index) were ‘independent urban towns’ and ‘rural areas with moderate urban influence’. This means that counties with a higher proportion of their popula-tion living in areas classified as either ‘independent urban towns’ or ‘rural areas with moderate urban influence’ were more resilient. The variables that had a negative impact on resilience (i.e. a positive effect on the sensitivity index) were ‘satellite urban towns’ and ‘rural areas with high urban influence’. That means that counties with a proportionate-ly high population in these areas were more vul-nerable to unemployment caused by the Covid19 crisis. This indicates that areas with less urban in-fluence were more resilient. One possible reason for this could be the nature of employment in the different areas. Jobs in areas classified as ‘indepen-dent urban towns’ and ‘rural areas with moderate urban influence’ are more likely to be considered essential i.e. employment in grocery shops and pharmacies which stayed open or employment in the agriculture sector. While jobs in ‘satellite urban towns’ and ‘rural areas with high urban influence’ may not have been considered essential.The same analysis was carried out for the eco-nomic resilience of counties in response to the fi-nancial crisis. This is presented in table 4. As can be seen from the table, none of the variables were statistically significant. That is to say ‘population distribution’ did not have an effect on the eco-nomic resilience of counties with respect to the financial crisis.Table 3Impact of population distribution on economic resilience to the Covid19 crisisIndependent Variable Pearson CoefficientP-valueCities 0.2327 0.2527Satellite urban towns 0.5911*** 0.0015Independent urban towns –0.5328*** 0.0051Rural areas with high urban influence0.3673* 0.0649Rural areas with moderate urban influence–0.4686** 0.0158Highly rural/remote areas –0.2762 0.172Source: Own calculations based on data from the central statistics office.Table 4Impact of population distribution on economic resilience to the financial crisisIndependent Variable Pearson CoefficientP-valueCities –0.3225 0.1081Satellite urban towns 0.2421 0.2335Independent urban towns 0.1283 0.5323Rural areas with high urban influence0.2436 0.2304Rural areas with moderate urban influence0.0265 0.8979Highly rural/remote areas –0.1325 0.5189Source: Own calculations based on data from the central statistics officeR-ECONOMY, 2020, 6(3), 146–153 doi: 10.15826/recon.2020.6.3.012151 https://journals.urfu.ru/index.php/r-economyOnline ISSN 2412-0731ConclusionThere were two research questions at the be-ginning of this study. The first question we ana-lysed was to see if economic resilience to the fi-nancial crisis was correlated to resilience to the Covid19 crisis. We can see that for counties in Ireland there was no correlation between the two. This means that counties that were resilient to the financial crisis were not necessarily resilient to the Covid19 crisis. This is important as it highlights how the two recessions are different in nature. Determinants of resilience are not concrete; they change over time and will change depending on the type of recession that occurs. Economic resi- lience to one recession is not a good indication of resilience to future recessions.The second question was to do with the ur-ban-rural divide of economic resilience. The re-sults show that the population distribution was not a factor for the economic resilience of coun-ties for the financial crisis. However, it was a con-tributing factor for economic resilience for the Covid19 crisis. More resilient regions were the counties that had population residing in indepen-dent urban towns and rural areas with moderate urban influence. The more vulnerable regions were the counties with population concentrated in satellite urban towns and rural areas with high urban influence. This indicates that areas less re- liant on urban influence were more resilient to the Covid19 crisis and is an indication that rural areas were more resilient.As time passes, more data will become avai-lable. Future research should focus on the eco-nomic structure of counties in Ireland and how that contributed to the economic resilience. It is likely that some sectors of the economy have been worse hit, and this will consequently affect dif-ferent counties to varying degrees. For example, counties that rely on tourism and the hospitality industry are likely to be more effected by Covid19, whereas counties that rely on agriculture are likely to be more resilient. Further research into this will be fruitful.ReferencesBerkes, F., & Folke, C. (1998). Linking social and ecological systems: Management practices and social mechanisms for building resilience.
