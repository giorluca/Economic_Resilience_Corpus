A signicant amount of research has been conducted regarding the resilienceof the regions and the factors that contribute to allow them to face challenges, crises,or disasters. The rise of promising sectors like Machine learning (ML) and ArticialIntelligence (AI) can enhance this research using computing power in regional economic,social, and environmental data analysis to nd patterns and create prediction models.Through Machine Learning, the following research introduces the use of models thatcan predict the performance of a region in disasters. A case study of the performanceof USA Counties during the Covid19 rst wave period of the pandemic and the relatedrestrictions that were applied by the authorities was used in order to reveal the obvious orhidden parameters and factors that aected their resilience, in particular their economicresponse, and other interesting patterns between all the involved attributes. This paperaims to contribute to a methodology and to oer useful guidelines in how regional factorscan be translated and processed by data and ML/AI tools and techniques. The proposedmodels were evaluated on their ability to predict the economic performance of eachcounty and in particular the dierence of its unemployment rate between March andJune of 2020. The former is based on several economic, social, and environmental data-up to that point in time- using classiers like neural networks and decision trees. Acomparison of the dierent models' execution was performed, and the best models werefurther analyzed and presented. Further execution results that identied patterns andconnections between regional data and attributes are also presented. The main results ofthis research are i) a methodological framework of how regional status can be translatedinto digital models and ii) related examples of predictive models in a real case. An eortwas also made to decode the results in terms of regional science to produce useful andmeaningful conclusions, thus a decision tree is also presented to demonstrate how thesemodels can be interpreted. Finally, the connection between this work and the strongcurrent trend of regional and urban digitalization towards sustainability is established.Key words: Regions, Resilience, Covid19, Machine Learning, Prediction Models, USA,Counties, Restrictions, Economic Impact, Unemployment rate1 IntroductionExtensive research has been conducted regarding the resilience of the regions and thefactors that contribute to allow them to face challenges, respond and recover from dis-turbances, crises, or disasters. There is a vast amount of related literature available.113114 C. Manousiadis, E. GakiThis study aims to: create models through Machine Learning that predict the performance of a regionin disasters to nd the parameters/factors (conrm obvious from classic regionalapproaches or show hidden from data) that aect the resilience of the regions. mainly contribute to a methodology and oer useful guidelines on how regionalfactors can be translated and be processed by data and ML/AI tools and techniques.1.1 The notion of resilienceThe notion of resilience has recently gained more popularity due to the extended economiccrises that most of the entire world faced in the last decades and the recent health crisisdue to Covid19. Originally, resilience was used in engineering and ecology (Holling 1973),but since then, the concept has been used in many elds including regional economics.Half of the world's population resides in cities, with urban population expected to reach70% of the global population by 2050 (United Nations 2016). Urban areas serve aslocations that drive sustainable development, equality, inclusivity, cultural diversity, andare centers for innovation (Dhar, Khirfan 2017, Pickett et al. 2004). The recent economicand health crisis along with ecosystem pressure, climate change, migration, and otherissues have increased the impact of urban crises. Therefore, the community resilienceconcept and corresponding mechanisms to build resilience on the community's complexsystems have become popular (Abdul-Rahman et al. 2021). In addition, developingCommunity Resilience Assessment (CRA) tools is attributed to building a sustainableworld (Seeliger, Turok 2013).Regional resilience has been dened in many forms. A denition of regional resilienceis the one proposed by Foster (2007). According to Foster (2007), it is the ability ofa region to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from disturbance. Bristow(2010)Bristow (2010) denes resilience as the capacity of a system to absorb disturbanceand reorganize while undergoing change, so as to still retain essentially the same function,structure and feedbacks. Kallioras (2011) argues that resilience of a region is measuredbased on the evaluation of its ability to maintain a successful path of development after adisturbance, whether success is perceived in terms of traditional indicators such as growthor change of employment, or in terms of a synthetic index. According to Proag (2014),the concept of the regional resilience takes two broad forms: (1) hard resilience: thedirect strength of structures when placed under pressure such as increasing the resilienceof a structure through specic strengthening measures to reduce their probability ofcollapse, and (2) soft resilience: the ability of systems to absorb and recover from theimpact of disruptive events without fundamental changes in function or structure, whichdepend on the exibility and adaptive capacity of the system as a whole, rather thansimply strengthening structures or institutions in relation to specic stresses, as in thehard resilience approach The most basic ways regions respond after each disorder areresistance, recovery, re-orientation, and renewal or resumption (Martin 2012). However,Pendall et al. (2010) argue that regions face two main categories of disturbance: shocksand slow burns. In addition, according to the degree of resilience in a disturbance,regions are classied by three main categories (Briguglio et al. 2006, Hill et al. 2008): Economically resilient regions that improve or at least return to their original con-dition Shock-resistant regions that withstand and don't escape from their course Non-resilient regions which cannot return to their original stateThe measurement of resilience is not an easy exercise, as this depends on the spe-cic system under study and the ways that resilience is considered or requested to becalculated, either qualitatively or quantitatively. A qualitative assessment is useful tounderstand the current situation while quantitative measures give quantied estimates ofperformance that may be more meaningful to stakeholders e.g., policy makers seeking forparameters and values or researchers studying specic elds in the region (Proag 2014).REGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023C. Manousiadis, E. Gaki 115There are several dierent methodologies or complex indicators proposed in the liter-ature or by authorities that measure resilience. They mainly involve economic, environ-mental, societal indicators, statistical analysis, and comparison with parameters stronglyrelated to resilience, such as GDP and employment. The aim is to identify the driversof crisis recovery and investigate the structural characteristics of the regions. Eorts arealso made for a common framework. For example, a relevant technical report by the JointResearch Centre (JRC), which is the European Commission's science and knowledge ser-vice, proposes a simple 'handy' composite Regional Resilience Indicator to measure andmonitor economic system resilience at the regional level in order to facilitate a commonand easy understanding of this complex and dynamic process. This approach extends theexisting theoretical framework and contributes to resilience a well-dened life cycle. Thecomposite indicator weights have been attributed through weight elicitation techniquesbuilt upon principal component analysis (Serpieri, Pontarollo 2018).In this study, the authors are exploring a hybrid (both qualitative and quantitative)assessment of the resilience. We are attempting to assess regional response to shock, clas-sifying regions (counties) mainly in the range of the last two categories (shock resistantand non-resilient) without absolute correspondence, while also exploring the parametersthat may aect this assessment and classication, which can then be used for policymaking or research.1.2 Machine Learning and ResilienceThe rise of promising sectors in computer science such as Machine learning (ML) and Ar-ticial Intelligence (AI) can boost many elds of research from e.g., medical applicationsand diagnosis (Shehab et al. 2022, Ahsan, Siddique 2022, Qezelbash-Chamak et al. 2022),to drug discovery (Patel, Shah 2022), and cybersecurity (Berghout et al. 2022). This alsoincludes topics in the general framework of regional science, such as construction and in-frastructure applications or seismic performance (Mirzaei et al. 2022, Mangalathu et al.2022), regional crop yield forecasting (Paudel et al. 2022), spatio-temporal modeling ofurban growth (Kim et al. 2022), and visual analyses of regional economy (Bai et al.2022). The use of ML and the increasing computing power can support regional researchto expand beyond the classic math, quantitative methods, and statistical analysis. It cancontribute to the automation of searching, creating, calculating, and validating models,though hidden paths and by performing correlations and combinations which their exe-cution would consume unrealistic time with the classic manual tools. Thus, ML can beapplied in regional -economic, social, and environmental- data, to nd patterns, forecast,and develop prediction models, contributing to policy making and strategic planning.According to relevant literature the relation between statistics and machine learningconsists of an increase in data complexity and the number of input variables and theirpossible associations make classical statistical inference less tractable and precise. Whilein such cases we could use ML approaches instead to ll in the unobserved aspects ofthe system while being eective even when the data are gathered without a carefullycontrolled experimental design and in the presence of complicated nonlinear interactions(Bzdok et al. 2018). In similar cases, we could also use ML to extract information fromdata more eectively (Zhang et al. 2022). ML tools and techniques provide means forempirical validation e.g., machine learning proved to be essential in understanding andlinking indicators and indices to policy, resilience, and empirical data, contributing toa better understanding of climate resilience (Feldmeyer et al. 2020). ML tools can ex-pand the capabilities of traditional models e.g., capture nonlinear eects which are notdetected by traditional econometric models. This has been demonstrated by detect-ing important factors and nonlinear relationships between regional GDP per capita andHigher Education Systems indicators that have provided useful insights and suggestionsfor policymakers (Bertoletti et al. 2022) or to incorporate spatial, contemporaneous, andhistorical dependencies e.g., lead-lag non-linear relationships among past urban changesin each region and its neighbors (Kim et al. 2022). As indicated above, the discussionin literature of comparing traditional models (mainly statistical) with ML models is ac-tive. In many applications, ML models performed better than statistical models, e.g.,predict particulate matter (Kulkarni et al. 2022) or suicides (Grendas et al. 2022). MLREGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023116 C. Manousiadis, E. Gakimodels have improved the existing models when combined with statistical ones, e.g.,Alzheimer's disease (Tan et al. 2021). They have also optimized model calibration (Am-roun et al. 2022). Although the core of these techniques uses mathematical models; theeld of the search is signicantly expanded by the acceleration and automation providedby computers.As mentioned, data techniques used in various cases can be found in the literature,mainly concerning specic and more focused elds or topics than general ones. Untilrecently, related research of using ML tools in regional science focused on overall sustain-ability and performance, and resilience of regions had been limited, especially comparedto other elds such as medical applications. In recent years, the standard has transitionedto a comprehensive and overall study of regions and areas using such tools e.g., using de-cision trees for regional Development Classication Models (Munandar, Winarko 2015).A recent study of resilience focused on earthquakes using historical data from previousseismic events and long-term historical behavior of regions (Fantechi, Modica 2022) isanother example of combining traditional econometric with ML techniques (Bertolettiet al. 2022), which can apply ML to land-use change modeling (Kim et al. 2022). ML isalso expected to play a major role in building better and modern Community ResilienceAssessment tools by incorporating the use of big data, machine learning, and articialintelligence to take care of spatio-temporal dynamism (Abdul-Rahman et al. 2021).The paper adds to the debate on regional resilience by introducing the use of mod-els through the utilization of Machine Learning. For this purpose, we use ML tech-niques to predict the performance of regions under shock, identify the more importantattributes, and propose a methodological framework of how regional status can be trans-lated into models. The paper is structured whereas the next section (Section 2) presentsthe methodology in detail, including the dened time period, the case study, the datasets, the variables, and the models used. Section 3 presents the analysis and the resultsof models' development and execution, whilst Section 4 illustrates the conclusions andfuture directions.2 Methodology2.1 The Case StudyThis paper will focus on economic impact of Covid19 in USA Counties and in particulartheir change of unemployment rate during the rst wave of pandemic and the relatedrestrictions to examine the implementation of machine learning techniques and relatedways/methodology to achieve this. The overview of the case is presented in Table 1 andit will be further analyzed in the next chapters.The period between March and June of 2020 is termed the Disaster Period anddenes the event studied for the selected regions in terms of their resilience and especiallyfor this case, their ability to handle the increase of unemployment during the restrictionsperiod. The information and related data that exist until the start of this period areconsidered as the current situation of the regions. These are considered as the input ofthe models. On the other hand, changes in values of various regional statistics duringthe disaster period -or values just after the end of the period- indicate how much theywere aected -absolutely and comparatively- and thus are considered as performance andresilience indicators and as the output for the models.2.2 Data Semantics and DimensionsThe current research mainly studies the response of the unemployment rate -not asunique but as a commonly accepted indicator of economic performance- in the specicdisturbance dened as rst wave and related restrictions of Covid19. Resistance andrecovery belong to the current eld of research due to both being types of regionalresponses. The results of the prediction models can contribute to the determination ofresistance and recovery, and therefore to the degree of resilience of the areas.In addition to the challenge itself (the ecient operation of machine learning modelsin regional science), great challenges are also identied in nding and properly adaptingREGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023C.

Appropriate input andoutput of the models should be clearly dened and selected with right semantics anddimensions. In this direction, the following should be dened: The time frame of disaster period for which resilience and correspondence of areasare studied: in this case, the disaster period is dened as the rst Covid wave andthe related stay-at-home orders of the states and in some cases of the counties(autonomously), which are generalized in the USA at the time between March andJune of 2020. The amplitude of the disaster: as an assumption is related mainly to the duration ofthe restriction's orders (the longer the restriction period, the greater disaster) andsecondary to their starting date (not so much concerning the disaster size, but asan extra comparison indicator for similarity between disasters of dierent counties).As we study the resilience and mainly the economic impact on the areas, pandemicdata such as cases and deaths were considered irrelevant (or indirect factors), whilethe focus was on the restrictions that were raised by authorities (probably impliedand forced by cases and deaths. If the resilience of the health system(s) was studied,then these parameters could be considered as direct) and have aected directly thebusinesses and the mobility of the counties. Other related data e.g., number ofbusiness closed or other market related parameters were strongly considered to bepart of the research, but their collection was not possible due to unavailability.Therefore this is considered to be part of future research focused in regions wherethe related data are available. The areas/regions: in this case US Counties will be dened as dierent instancesof the structure dened below. The data set as the set or subset of the instances (areas/regions) used to train andtest the model: in this case the subsets as dened in Subsets of examination test. The data: Appropriate input/output as attributes (values per instance) which togetherconstitute the basic data structure:* input as current state: most recent stats before the start date of disasterperiod or constants/slow changing characteristics of the counties* output as performance indicators: to be the change of examined value dur-ing disaster period (or similar metrics taking into consideration seasonaladjustment).REGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023118 C.

There are unlimited sets and subsets that can be testedor demonstrated; most of which are very dicult to result in ecient prediction models.The research and comparison of dierent data sets and the eect of their similarities ordierences in the models is included in our future research. Within the scope of thispaper and based on the results of the execution, the two subsets below were selectedas indicative to present our main methodology and the factors taken into considerationwhile translating real- life information to data sets for the purpose of machine learningtechniques. To dierentiate between data sets, the desire was to display that modelscan be created in both types of models (general or more focused with similar populationcategory and disaster amplitude). That is why these two subsets were selected.Subset A is a generic subset, from all the available US counties, of counties thatperformed good or bad during the restrictions. Subset B is more homogeneous as itincludes counties that performed good or bad but also maintain a large populationREGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023C. Manousiadis, E. Gaki 119Figure 3: From WEKA: Indicative Map of US Counties(100k and above). Counties in subset B had more similarities in the amplitude of thedisaster faced (stay-at-home-order duration and when order declared).The subsets were tested to create models predicting good or bad performance intheir output, meaning the increase of unemployment rate during disaster period for thecounties included.Subset A: counties that: performed good (0-0,7%) or bad (7% and over increase of UnemploymentRate) from all available counties therefore 377 counties/instancesSubset B: counties that: performed good (under 2,5%) or bad (6% and over increase of UnemploymentRate) from counties with population > 100k and same restrictions (17-40% of thedisaster period covered with stay-at-home-order and order declared soon inthe rst 4,5% of the period) therefore 89 counties/instancesFigure 3 is an indicative USA map with all the counties, Figures 4 and 5 present thespecic subsets A and B of counties dened in that map.2.4 Attributes selection and valuesThe selection of the appropriate attributes referred to in Section 2.2 is crucial to applyML models and provide useful results. Below the selection of the three main types ofdata is discussed, while Appendix A displays the list of the selected attributes used inthe models' execution, along with description and sources. Input attributes were selected based on demographic, industrial, employment, com-mute, and mobility, social, environmental, and health sector factors. As alreadymentioned, data mostly consists of percentages but sometimes absolute numbersdependent on their nature. Also, for the use of a-priori technique to nd rules,data were converted from numerical into classes. The selection of the attributesand/or their type/category is generally based on regional science and literature inboth elds of theory and on specic examples of indicators used in models (e.g.,Feldmeyer et al. 2020, Jackson et al. 2019, Munandar, Winarko 2015). The searchfor useful attributes was performed in many factors aecting regional resilience. AsREGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023120 C. Manousiadis, E.

Proposed variables estimated to relate pandemic with re-gional conditions are also taken into consideration (Killeen et al. 2020). Finally, anyextra interesting indicator identied was selected and tested. The general approachis the constant addition of several attributes (many times even correlated with eachother) to be tested and validated though the ML prediction models. ML modelscan be eective even when the data are gathered without a carefully controlled ex-perimental design and in the presence of complicated nonlinear interactions (Bzdoket al. 2018). Output was clustered to t prediction models which required output. The dis-continuously distinct clusters (like these demonstrated here) seem to have betterperformance, while the prediction of the continuous ones is a much more complexand dicult problem. Other attributes used to cluster counties into interesting subsets to be tested (re-strictions and pandemic stats) or other such as geographic coordinates to study thegeographical distribution and nature of the ndings.REGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023C.

Models produced from classiers try to classify this outclass as good or bad using the input attributes. The model's performance is thepercentage of the correctly classied instances to the whole set. The specic techniquesseen below were tested. The most interesting cases and these with best performance arepresented in detail later in this study: Classiers: Multilayer Perceptron (Neural Network) J48, Random Tree, REPtree (trees) Naive Bayes Decision Tables, JRip, OneR (rules) AdaBoostM1, Attribute Selection (e.g., wrapper selecting best subsets of at-tributes), Stacking, Bagging (Meta Classiers) A priori (association method, not a classier, produces rules associating any in-put/output attribute)3 Testing and results3.1 Classiers modelsAs discussed, many tests in dierent models and with dierent sets of input attributeswere tested in the framework of the study. A performance table (Table 2) shows the threemost interesting models created in both A and B subsets using selected input attributes,which show the percentage of Correctly Classied Instances using mainly the 10-foldcross-validation. This validation is considered the most valid and complete and it is usedto separate the set as: 90% for training and 10% for testing being repeated 10 times sothe whole set is tested as 10 independent tests. As displayed, the Multilayer Perceptronand Naive Bayes have a better performance in Subset B (which is the more focused-similar counties- approach), while J48 performs better in the more general Subset A.Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 present the full details regarding the best performancetests for every model.All the models have a very good prediction ability with the Multilayer Perceptron ableto correctly predict the performance of 81 out of 89 counties with only eight countiesbeing incorrectly classied (4 as bad, 4 as Good). Although it is not clear withoutfurther analysis what factors aected the models' decisions. Therefore, proportionally,the resilience of the counties can be a very useful prediction tool.REGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023122 C. Manousiadis, E.

This use of trees aims tond patterns and critical attributes and their specic critical values that may aect (orways that one can understand based on variables) whether a county will have good orbad performance in the disaster period. An example presented below will be displayedand explained. It was trained with the100% of subset, while scoring 96,62% as a treemodel. Performance, in the case where the whole set is also the training set, has a dif-ferent meaning than the classify/prediction rate. It means that tree can nd a way ofthinking to describe, in this example, the performance of 86 counties correctly and onlythree incorrectly.The main purpose of the tree is to visualize rules that result in a decision, in this caseabout whether a county is estimated/predicted to perform good (under 2,5%) or bad(6% and over increase of unemployment rate) during the specic disaster. A simpliedvisualization of the tree is displayed in Figure 7. It was produced in the Weka machineof the corresponding code is presented in Figure 6. We can detect, based on the outputof the model, specic factors that can aect the performance of a county. It is alsoimportant that we can see specic values involved.In this specic case, we can see that the commute time and way, vehicles available,and work from home aected the performance and the change of unemployment rate ofthe counties during the rst wave restrictions of Covid-19. Some conclusions that can beproduced from the gure are: If the presence of people that have a commute time above 30 minutes in their workand they drive alone (attribute: Long Commute Drives Alone) is under or equal to17% in some county, this means that this county will perform good. If the above is above 17%, but the percentage of people owning 1 vehicle is below orequal to 14,8%, then the (attribute: 1 Vehicle PCT) then by chance 90% (18.0/2.0referred to the output of Figure 6) this county will perform good. And similar for all the levels of the treeIt may be obvious that some parameters could positively aect the performance of thecounty (e.g., better commuting conditions will aect a lot of regional aspects includingresilience), but models like this provide specic numbers e.g., the referred 17% of longcommute driving alone or 0,26% commuting with bicycle. These specic numbers are anadditional level of information.4 Discussion & ConclusionBased on the work, practices, and approaches described in Section 2, an overall method-ological framework (displayed in Figure 8) has been developed.

Appropriate input includes forming data sets(Section 2.2) for training and testing the models, as well as the crucial step of deningthe appropriate semantics and dimensions of the data (e.g., meaningful input and clus-tering for the output). Based on these data sets, several machine models can be selectedfor testing and evaluation. Historical data are used for training the ML models, resultingin some predictive models (step 2), which are then tested and evaluated according totheir ability to predict the dened output on new (not used before for the training) inputdata set(s) (step 3).This study has created several ML models predicting the performance of a regionduring disasters and has found parameters that may aect the resilience of the regions.It also has presented the above methodology and useful guidelines in how regional factorscan be translated and processed by data and ML/AI tools and techniques, thus creatingrelated models like the ones that have been demonstrated.

Furthermore, although all models have done well in predicting the performance ofthe counties; decision trees oer more semantics and human readable information fromthe other models oering specic parameters and values that aect the results and thusmay aect the resilience of an area. Multilayer Perceptron and Neural Networks functionlike black boxes and it is dicult to extract information and readable conclusions fromtheir equations.As for the development of these models using regional, social, economic, and environ-mental factors and indicators and examining regional properties related to sustainabilityand resilience; there are challenges on how to properly adjust and translate these real-lifedata and properties into appropriate data to make ML models work. A key contribu-tion of this study is that it presents a methodology, examples, and practices on how torepresent regional factors in terms of data for the input of models (as attributes), thetime frame and the amplitude of disaster, and the areas/regions (as instances) formingthe required data set. It indicates how to choose the appropriate input and output ofthe models from this data set, clearly dened and selected with right semantics and di-mensions, and how to nd and properly adapt the available data to make the tested andapplied techniques work.As for the models' execution and demonstration, it was displayed that creating modelsfor predictions related to regional properties and especially for resilience that havingsatisfying performances is possible and deserves the attention of the regional scientists andpotentially could support decisions in policy making and regional development strategies.4.1 Future research suggestions and challengesData sectors, along with their increasing computing power could support regional researchto expand beyond the classic math, quantitative methods, and statistical analysis, con-tributing to the automation in the development and validation of models though hiddenpaths and performing correlations and calculating combinations whose calculation usingtraditional methods would consume an unrealistic amount of time. The added value ofML in other elds and especially in technical issues is already examined in the literature(Section 2.2). The verication of the corresponding added value of ML and its appli-cation in the less technical eld of regional development is an important eld of futurefurther research. Additionally, the appropriate selection of dierent model types havingdierent performance in dierent cases and types of test sets (in terms of focused orgeneral, similar, or dierent regions and amplitude of disasters, small or big data etc.)should be strongly considered. As far as the selection of input attributes is concerned, itREGION : Volume 10, Number 1, 2023C. Manousiadis, E. Gaki 125was based on regional science theories. However, any extra interesting indicator that wasidentied was tested as ML models can handle many parameters independently of theircorrelation. Specically, ML models include algorithms for the appropriate selection ofsets and subsets of input attributes. They can also calculate any correlation between allinput parameters (each other) and any contribution in the output. Therefore, the pro-posed general approach is the constant addition of several attributes (even correlated)and factors to be tested and validated though ML prediction models. This eort canbe further studied to enhance the function of the models measuring the eect of theinput parameters, their category, and/or their number in the model's performance. Afurther analysis should be dedicated to regional dimensions and direct related parameters(e.g., coordinates) by reason that coordinates were not used as input attributes in thisstudy. Another issue that should be studied is the understandability of the ML modelscreated. As discussed, classiers such as Neural Networks (e.g., Multilayer Perceptronused) function as black boxes. Thus, we must nd ways to decode the models andexport valuable and readable information and conclusions about the factors aectingtheir decisions and the regional resilience. Research in this direction may be combinedwith statistical analysis or other classic methods. On the other hand, decision trees dis-play specic values and variables indicating factors and values aecting the resilience. Afurther study should evaluate the true impact of these identied factors. It is of greatimportance and a great challenge to properly apply regional analysis in all informationexported by the ML models and integrate this knowledge smoothly to regional scienceresearch. The use of integrated models, combining classical with ML techniques, shouldand will be strongly considered in our further research. The way that information re-sulting from predictions can be used is very crucial and the improper use of it can leadto losses instead of benets (either technically or socially). Technical knowledge andwork cannot replace the social, humanitarian, political, and environmental dimensions.This work should be used as a tool with computational and ancillary activity. Despitethe challenges, these models that are utilizing the innovations on infrastructures andcomputer power could enhance and modernize the toolbox of regional analysis (currentlymainly based on mathematical oine methods), which could reveal new patterns and re-gional factors that could enable calculations that were not possible before. Additionally.real-time results, information, and predictions could be introduced. These tools andmodels could be used (or even be the baseline) in the framework of the current trendof digitalization of regions towards sustainability. They could be used to exploit datacollected from IoT or crowd sensing platforms, provide related features to digital toolsenabling smart and sustainable regions or cities, and therefore support decisions in policymaking and regional development strategies.ReferencesAbdul-Rahman M, Chan E, Li X, Wong M, Xu P (2021) Big data for community resilienceassessment: A critical review of selected global tools. 13451361.
