I. INTRODUCTION  
Over the past decades, public policy professionals, scholars, and social justice activists 
have focused on a myriad of challenges facing the criminal justice system. Of these challenges, 
building successful systems and programs for effective reentry in the community by formerly 
incarcerated individuals have proven to be one of the most challenging. Numerous studies, and a 
tremendous amount of data, have driven robust conversations on the national and state level to 
determine the most effective and feasible methods to reduce recidivism. One discernable change 
of note is that the federal government has been trending away from imposing harsh mandatory 
sentencing policies, and States have also taken a leadership role in experimenting with new ways 
to reduce recidivism.2 Recidivism is already a problem that the U.S. faces in booming economic 
times, so there is even more at stake during the economic fallout from the pandemic. Recently, the 
United States (“U.S.”), already has been releasing over 750,000 offenders from prison each year, 
prior to the onset of the global pandemic.3 Unfortunately, as discussed below, research has also 
shown that a large number of ex-offenders will return to prison within three to five years of their 
release. The U.S. faces historical and systematic challenges compounded by racial disparities, in 
terms of the successful reentry of formerly incarcerated individuals, and the pandemic has not only 
intensified the need to develop successful reentry policies, but has exacerbated underlying current 
inequities, as hundreds of jails and prisons are releasing thousands of incarcerated individuals to 
quell the spread of COVID-19. The need for solutions to prevent recidivism, especially in the wake 
of COVID-19, arises at the intersection of slowed economic growth with a shift in commerce and 
consumer trends towards e-commerce, with a marked decline in employment opportunities in 
various service sectors. This article will examine the synergy of building successful and equitable 
programs and policies to reduce recidivism; addressing the pandemic, and the sudden release of 
thousands of individuals from prisons and jails, and strengthening job recovery in an economic 
slowdown. We will examine several states who have made robust efforts to reduce recidivism via 
education and job training to ex-offenders and develop a roadmap of best practices that have 
proven effective, while developing policy solutions for federal implementation.

II. PRESENTING THE ISSUE OF RECIDIVISM, AND ECONOMIC INCLUSION ISSUES DURING 
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  
a. Background on Mass Incarceration and “tough on crime” policy 
The U.S. has had the highest incarceration rate in the world since 2002.4 According to 
figures released by the United States Department of Justice ( “DOJ”), the U.S. still has an 
incarceration rate five to 10 times higher than other industrialized countries.5 In 2017 it was 
reported that 2.27 million people were incarcerated in the U.S., which was a 500 percent increase 
over the last 40 years.6 The explanation of our daunting prison percentage can in large part be 
attributed to the political and public campaign of Barry Goldwater, who produced provocative and 
controversial advertisements exploiting the protests, riots, and crimes going on during the civil 
rights movement.7 The political campaign built the foundation for the platform of “getting tough 
on crime.”8 During Nixon’s Presidential Campaign in 1968, he won on, among other platforms, 
the concept of “Law and Order,”9 which was a derivative policy from Goldwater’s campaign. A 
result of this was an increase in the popularity of mandatory minimum sentencing policies. For 
example, one of the policies that evolved from such demands that still remains in place today is 
the “three strikes” law.10

LEGISLATION & POLICY BRIEF

This policy agenda also manifested in the “War on Drugs” waged by President Reagan and 
President Bush, and it contributed to a significant boom in the prison population.11 Beginning in 
1985, there was a significant uptick in juvenile drug arrests, primarily of African American12 
juveniles.13 Most of these arrests derived from the crack epidemic as arrests associated with 
underground economy activities provided a locus for violence.14 In the 1990s, President Clinton 
signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which also kept the mass 
incarceration trend upward, albeit not at the same rates as in the 1980s.15 The effects of such high 
rates of incarceration can be attributed to social problems which include racial inequities, 
disruption of family life,16 and the main topic of this law review article—recidivism.  
The technical definition of Recidivism refers to the act of repeating undesirable and 
harmful behavior despite having suffered negative consequences, for example, prison time, for 
such behavior.17 The National Institute of Justice (NIJ), which falls under the DOJ, provides us 
with historical data related to recidivism.18 In this context, recidivism refers to the ex-offenders’ 
relapse into criminal behavior after the ex-offender has been released for serving their sanction or 
sentence from the previous crime.19 Although there remains much debate about the effectiveness 
of incarceration in deterring future crime, this consideration is beyond the scope of this article, and 
instead, we will focus on the prevention of recidivism after release.20 According to the data from 
the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), 67.8 percent of released prisoners were arrested for a

new crime within three years of being released.21 Moreover, 76.7 percent of ex-offenders were 
arrested within five years of being released.22 The U.S. Sentencing Commission estimated in 2016 
that nearly 50 percent of released Federal prisoners would be re-arrested within eight years.23 
Moreover, 32 percent and 25 percent of those will be re-convicted and re-incarcerated.24 The report 
stated that the majority of these cases of recidivism would occur in the first 5 years following 
release.25 The importance of reducing recidivism impacts a wide berth of stakeholder and public 
interest and racial equity matters. A reduction in recidivism improves public safety, helps ex-
offenders resume family and community responsibilities, and reduces taxpayer expenses on 
prisons.26  
b. Difficulties of Economic Inclusion for Ex-Offenders  
Studies indicate that there is a correlation between employment and recidivism.27 Ex-
offenders who are able to obtain employment within the first six months of their release from jail 
experience an almost 50 percent decrease in recidivism, compared to their counterparts that are 
not able to obtain employment upon their release.28 However, research has also shown that 
individuals with convictions who are released from prison have difficulty finding jobs and 
reintegrating into their communities.29 Employment opportunities for ex-offenders are low give 
the discrimination that takes place when someone discloses their criminal past.30 Moreover, most

ex-offenders lack education and have limited work experience.31 Thus, ex-offenders having very 
low skill levels combined with the hesitation, if not overt discrimination, by employers in hiring 
ex-offenders, present one of the central challenges to reducing recidivism.32 The Pew Center has 
identified the lack of employment opportunities for ex-offenders as one of the leading causes of 
recidivism.33  
These challenges have spurred many initiatives on the state and federal level. For example, 
President Bush signed the Second Chance Act to provide funding for prisoner reentry programs.34 
During his State of the Union address in 2004 leading up to the signature of the law he stated 
“America is the land of the second chance and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead 
should lead to a better life.”35 Unfortunately, despite such encouraging rhetoric and legislation, 
recidivism remains a significant and enduring obstacle.36 Ex-offenders face high barriers in 
reincorporating themselves back into society once they have fulfilled their sentence.37 These 
persistent barriers include obtaining jobs that pay livable wages (if employment can be secured at 
all), which would allow them to obtain the financial means and skills to thrive on their own and 
build a better future.38 The National Employment Law Project estimates that around 70 million 
individuals have an arrest history that may show up on a background check whether or not they 
were convicted.39 Exacerbating the problem, offenders with the most challenges are

disproportionately African American or Hispanic, with little to no education, and impoverished.40 
Additionally, research has shown that another major obstacle for individuals trying to reintegrate 
into society is the lack of access to sustainable housing that gainful employment would provide.41 
There is significant research that shows that these two factors, reliable housing and regular 
employment, significantly reduce the possibility of recidivism.42 Barriers to housing and 
employment are persistent and common for many ex-offenders as they face discrimination from 
employers, navigate a job market with a lack of relevant work experience, and suffer from housing 
insecurity.43 Furthermore, these barriers are especially problematic for communities of color.44 
Ultimately, for the most previously incarcerated individuals, the lack of access to stable and 
reliable employment are the regnant barriers to successful reintegration into the community.45 Ex-
offenders of color also face additional difficulties by experiencing increased rates of recidivism 
when released into communities more likely to be plagued by racial inequality and economic 
stagnation.46  
Prior to the onset of COVID, in the midst of record-low unemployment rates, an 
astonishing 27 percent of formerly incarcerated individuals were without employment.47 That is 
higher than the national unemployment rate at the height of the Great Depression in 1933, which

was about 25 percent.48 The country’s unemployment rate resulted in employers across numerous 
industries struggling to find qualified and skilled workers in a tightening labor pool.49 There are 
numerous theories as to the disconnect between ex-offenders needing employment and employers 
are looking for employees, such as an overwhelming education gap.50 Research has also shown, 
collectively, the United States loses approximately $78 billion to $87 billion in annual GDP due 
to the unemployment or underemployment of people with criminal records.51 Over the next decade, 
the skills gap is expected to grow at a very fast rate, with approximately 5 million new job openings 
that will require specific credentials, many times including bachelor’s degrees.52 One of the major 
research and policy initiatives to address this was spearheaded by the Council of State 
Governments (CSG) Justice Center, working in partnership with the U.S. Department of Justice’s 
Bureau of Justice Assistance, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Annie E. Casey Foundation, and 
stakeholders. They developed the Integrated Reentry and Employment Strategies (IRES) white 
paper. This was a research based framework of evidence-based practices and policies to assist 
communities reform and improve the manner in which they implement employment focuses 
reentry services.53 The three-year IRES pilot project began in 2015 in two sites: Milwaukee 
County, Wisconsin, and Palm Beach County, Florida. We will be taking a closer look at multiple 
states in our comparative analysis section.

c. The Impact of COVID-19 
Americans are struggling to meet the challenges that COVID-19 has caused such as job 
loss, reduction of hours, furloughs, and wage cuts. The economic repercussions are enormous and 
extend to housing instability, food insecurity, and rising health care costs. Low and Moderate 
Income (LMI) consumers are particularly vulnerable, as are communities of color, as they are 
overrepresented in front line professions and work in the hardest hit industries.54 As Federal 
unemployment benefits are set to run out millions of Americans are once again facing the prospect 
of an economic shock. The day-to-day financial lives of working-class Americans were already 
precarious before COVID-19’s effects were felt. 2019 Federal Reserve research has shown that 40 
percent of Americans cannot afford $400 in case of an emergency.55 This is especially problematic 
because the partial shutdown of the US economy in response to COVID- 19 had the most 
devastating impact on vulnerable Americans, who experience lower wages, little savings, and 
reduced work opportunities.56 In the labor market, about 50 percent of the 22 million jobs lost 
during the first quarter of 2020, and into April 2020, have been regained as states opened up and 
people returned to work.57 However, overall economic activity still remains below pre-pandemic 
levels, and the economy still faces many potential headwinds.58 As the Chairman of the Federal 
Reserve, Jerome Powell, stated in his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee: 
“The downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans; those least able to bear the burden have 
been the most affected. The rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, 
for women, and for African-Americans and Hispanics. This reversal of economic fortune has 
upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future.” 59 
d. The Case for a Broad and Inclusive Government Response 
As COVID-19 started to spread across the world, and then the United States, at the 
beginning of 2020, the U.S. economy had recovered to the extent that the total of job losses in the 
Great Recession had been reversed, and unemployment was at record lows along with wide scale

access to benefits.60 In fact, many workers were confident that if they lost their jobs, 
Unemployment Insurance and social safety net programs were able to mitigate the disruption to 
their day-to-day lives before they sought subsequent employment.61 The impact of COVID has 
been detrimental to this recovery, but even more so on those communities that have not shared in 
the broader economic recovery over the last 10 years. The patchwork of safety net and economic 
policy programs supporting large portions of African American and Latinx communities is, as it 
has historically been, far more unstable and unreliable.62 The aftermath of the Great Society era 
produced core supports, including housing assistance, job training, Medicaid, and the Food Stamp 
program (SNAP’s predecessor), but so-called “alien restrictions” were added which effectively 
excluded not just undocumented immigrants, but often their lawfully-present spouses and 
children—who were predominantly Latinx*—from vital economic, health, and nutritional 
supports.63 The cumulative result of dozens of such policy decisions over the last century—only 
some of which were explicitly discriminatory based on race or ethnicity—has shaped a 
fundamentally unequal society, where Hispanic and African Americans at the onset of the 
pandemic were simultaneously more susceptible to the coronavirus and resulting economic 
dislocations, but had a far less comprehensive safety net to fall back upon.64 
 Similar to the impact that COVID has had upon Latino populations, there is research shows 
that African American workers face far more economic and health insecurity from COVID-19 than 
white workers, based on economic vulnerabilities resulting from a history of racism and 
discrimination.65  Despite the literal unprecedented nature of COVID on the World’s health and 
economies, the exacerbation of historic and ongoing social and economic injustices, has 
disproportionality harmed African Americans. According to research by the Economic Policy 
Institute:  
Persistent racial disparities in health status, access to health care, 
wealth, employment, wages, housing, income, and poverty all 
contribute to greater susceptibility to the virus—both economically 
and physically. Black workers and their families were economically 
insecure before the pandemic tore through the United States. The 
pandemic and related job losses have been especially devastating for 
black households because they have historically suffered from 
higher unemployment rates, lower wages, lower incomes, and much 
less savings to fall back on, as well as significantly higher poverty

magnified the current economic damage to these workers and their

The essential link between the health vulnerabilities and harmful economic policies cannot be 
understated in understanding the devastating impact of COVID has had upon African Americans.67 
e. Reentry, Employment, and COVID 
State and local jails and prisons have instituted initiatives to address the growing danger of 
the pandemic. Many states have reduced the size of the incarcerated population in a variety of 
programs with differing criteria. These initiatives were in large part due to the conditions that 
incarcerated populations face, along with the correctional staff, which pose a heightened danger 
for COVID transmission. Below is a non-exhaustive list of such measures: 68  
California. In April of 2020 California set a statewide emergency bail schedule to reduce 
bail to $0 for many misdemeanor and limited low-level felony offenses.69 As a result the jail 
population has markedly decreased, and by the end of May 2020, jail populations in Los Angeles 
County and Sacramento County declined by almost a third.70 In Orange County, the jail 
population dropped by almost 45 percent during in the same period,71 while San Diego, San Mateo, 
and Stanislaus counties also released hundreds of people held pretrial.72 And although the

California judicial council voted to end this statewide emergency bail schedule in June, 31 counties 
(collectively housing about 80 percent of California residents) have elected to keep the emergency 
bail schedule in place until July 2020. 73 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department has 
reduced their jail population by 10 percent in the past month to mitigate the risk of virus 
transmission in crowded jails. To reduce the jail population by 1,700 people, the 
Sheriff reports releasing people with less than 30 days left on their sentences and the Department 
is considering releasing pregnant women and older adults at high risk. (March 24)74 District 
attorneys in San Francisco, California have taken steps to release people held pretrial, with limited 
time left on their sentence, and charged with non-violent offenses. (March 11 and March 16).75 
Michigan. Similar initiatives occurred in Detroit, Michigan when Sentencing judges 
ordered the release of hundreds of people from Wayne County Jail and 150 people from the 
Oakland County jail,76 and the chief judge of the county circuit court signed at least 200 orders for 
administrative releases since early March.77 
North Dakota. In North Dakota, officials have instituted policies to drastically decrease the 
jail population, with the Cass County jail population declining by over 30 percent since March, 
and the Stutsman County Jail population cut by about half.78  
Massachusetts. In April of 20202 the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court authorized the 
release of people held in jails pretrial for “nonviolent” offenses and those held on technical 
probation and parole violations. Both the Plymouth County and Norfolk County jails have

convictions, "low-level indictable crimes," and "disorderly persons offenses.” (March 23)108 
This non-exhaustive list presents a limited picture of initiatives taken by various state, 
initiatives that are by no means concluding anytime soon, to release individuals early in response 
to the pandemic. The world that these individuals find themselves thrown into is plagued by a 
historical and global pandemic, in addition to the ongoing and systemic barriers discussed above 
when it comes to recidivism. In the midst of these tremendous challenges, there are intersections 
of policy tools that can synergistically provide multi-stakeholder solutions. As economic 
headwinds increase in uncertainly and impact, there is a need for policy makers to ensure that these 
former inmates are able to reintegrate into society, and remain in the community, while 
contributing to the recovering economy. The policies discussed below are highlighted in the 
proceeding section, and serve as the foundation of policy strategies that can be repurposed, 
combined and federally funded, in order to addresses inequality, buttress the economic recovery, 
and provide sustainable long term solutions to systemic barriers for reentry.  
f. The central role of education and employment in promoting successful reentry  
The fact that many formerly incarcerated people attempt to reenter into their communities 
with the odds stacked against them is evident by looking at the statistics even with a cursory 
review. This is the case especially considering the requisite educational attainment, and the need 
for academic credentials, to enter the job market. More than two-thirds of incarcerated people hold 
some type of high school credential, but only 6 percent hold a postsecondary degree,109 and most 
have limited workforce experience and marketable skills.110 The skills and credential gap is layered 
onto a documented reluctance of employers to hire people with a criminal record, and long standing 
practices of discriminating. Furthermore, these challenges are in addition to broader economic 
barriers to employment such as acquiring affordable housing, reliable transportation, and non-
employer sponsored health coverage. As a result, over 40 percent of people reentering into their

community are rearrested within their first year of their release,111 and the unemployment rate 
among formerly incarcerated people is over 27 percent higher than the U.S. unemployment rate 
during the Great Depression.112 Recently, federal, state, and local governments are shifting policy 
priorities, with an increasing amount of research demonstrating the need for comprehensive and 
multifaceted support and resources that promote successful reentry. One of the core tenants of this 
strategy is focusing on and investing in postsecondary education.113 The substantial and robust 
statistical evidence supporting the benefits of postsecondary education for incarcerated people 
seeking to reenter their communities has led to bipartisan support for increased federal investments 
in career and technical education (CTE) and postsecondary programming. This includes the 
introduction of the Restoring Education and Learning Act (REAL Act), legislation that would 
reinstate Pell Grant funding eligibility for students while incarcerated. learning in prison.114 In 
parallel, national nonprofits and institutions of higher education are increasingly developing 
collaborative partnerships at the local level to expand postsecondary education opportunities, 
vocational training, and comprehensive reentry support services for formerly incarcerated people.  
Unfortunately, the policy landscape is less promising at the state level. The scope of the 
role of state prisons cannot be overstated, as they house approximately 87 percent of all 
incarcerated individuals,115 and spending over $40 billion annually116 on administration and 
operations. Many advocates have identified that state policies have historically intensified the 
barriers that incarcerated people face when attempting to obtain academic training and credentials 
to leverage in their employment search when seeking to reenter their community. Across all 50 
states, there are about 14,000 legal provisions that limit and/or restrict occupational licensing for 
individuals with criminal records, including over 5,000 provisions that impose mandatory bans on 
specific licenses based on certain criminal convictions.117 In addition to these bans, many states 
have imposed additional barriers to workforce participation through educational opportunities, 
such as requirements to disclose criminal history on university and employment applications and 
restrictions on housing support and eligibility for government contracts and services.118

LEGISLATION & POLICY BRIEF

The Council of State Governments (CSG) Justice Center conducted a 50-state policy and 
practice survey on access to postsecondary education for people who are incarcerated.119 The study 
“sought to assess whether states have the fundamental statutory, administrative, and funding 
building blocks in place to provide these individuals with high-quality postsecondary education 
programs and services while incarcerated and when they return to the community.”120 The report 
identified four categorical resources necessary to provide postsecondary education to people who 
are incarcerated in facilities and after their release and reentry: (1) use of available funding, (2) a 
continuum of postsecondary programming, (3) elimination of participation restrictions, and (4) 
incentives and supports to encourage participation and completion.121  
i. Funding 
The report unsurprisingly identified funding as a key resource, defined as “uses key federal 
and state funding streams to support postsecondary education for people while incarcerated and 
after release.”122 The specific funding sources considered were (1) funds from the Carl D. Perkins 
Career and Technical Education Act (Perkins IV), (2) Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act 
(WIOA), or (3) has a Second Chance Act Pell pilot site to provide postsecondary education to 
adults in state correctional facilities.123 In addition the report determined whether or not a state did 
not restrict the use of state financial aid for formerly incarcerated people, or those with criminal 
records. The report determined that even though funding was a key resource, “[...] only 17 states 
are tapping into any one of the key federal funding streams available to all states [...] to support 
postsecondary education for people while incarcerated and after release into the community, while 
also fully allowing currently and formerly incarcerated people to access state financial aid 
funding.”124 
ii. Offerings 
The report defines offerings as “access to a full range of postsecondary education programs 
aligned with local labor market trends and employer needs.”125 The report particularly focused on 
CTE training, associate degrees, and bachelor’s degrees. The report also determined whether or 
not the state had identified, based on research and data, local labor market trends, employer 
feedback, or program outcome data in their determination for types of education and programming 
offered within correctional facilities.126 This is particularly significant given that over the next

decade, the gap in skilled labor is likely to increase, with approximately five million projected job 
openings requiring applicants to have occupational licenses and/or at least a bachelor’s degree.127 
The report elevates this intersection of labor market needs and promoting reentry in its finding 
that: “provision[s] of high-quality postsecondary education for incarcerated individuals offers 
states a key opportunity to not only adopt a research-based recidivism-reduction strategy, but to 
tap into the underutilized potential of this population to fulfill local labor market needs.”128 The
