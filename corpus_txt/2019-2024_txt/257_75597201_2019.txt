Abstract. In northeast Thailand, the irrigated agricultural land was only 7.6% (in 2012) of 
total and others were classified as rain-fed so that climate change makes agricultural 
production unstable and also makes negative impact to the societies and economics in 
rural area. To mitigate these issues, it is desirable to develop enhanced adaptation measures. 
In this study, we focused on weather induced economic damages and effectiveness of 
index-based insurance system in Northeast Thailand. Firstly, we evaluated how affect the 
seasonal rainfall amount and patterns on rice yield and production through regression 
analysis by using the meteorological and agricultural statistic data. 8 province had positive 
correlation R>0.3 with Jul-Sep accumulated rainfall. And then, probability analysis was 
applied to monthly rainfall which was employed for insurance index value. As a result, 
setting amount and periods of insurance index was suitable. Secondly, household survey 
was conducted to investigate farmers’ conditions of water use, cultivation, income balance. 
In recent year, agricultural damage on farmers’ income was not so large (less than 3%), 
because 65% of farmers’ income relied on non-agricultural sector. That might be the one 
reason of constraints of insurance sales. 
 
Keywords: Agricultural damage, household survey, risk assessment, climate change 
adaptation.

1. Introduction 
 
Agricultural water use became more competitive by increased pressure from urbanization, industrialization, 
and climate change could affect to water supply and agriculture through changes in the seasonal timing and 
amount of rainfall, as well as severe floods and prolonged droughts. Approximately, 70% of the global 
water withdrawal and 85% of consumptive water use is directed toward irrigation. Therefore, information 
on the water use of agricultural sector is highly relevant in assessing the possible impact of changes in 
climate and socio-economic factors on regional water and food supply. Since it is necessary to provide large 
amounts of water to paddy fields compared with other upland crops, water harvesting and management in 
paddy fields is especially important for efficient water use and for regional water cycle in Thailand. 
Recently, climate change has caused water shortage or severe natural disasters. The weather induced 
losses and damage in the agricultural sector will leads the decline of global agricultural production, causing 
insecurity of food. For Thailand, climate change has a direct effect on the export of food and agricultural 
products, which is one of the main income sources of the country. For example, Thailand had experienced 
severe flood in 2011: one of the worst floods in historical record. In 2015, Thailand had severe drought, 
leading to critical low levels of water allocation in whole country. Furthermore, agriculture provide the main 
income basis of farmers. Thus, climate change has a huge impact on individual farmers and has aggravated 
the problem of poverty (The Eleventh National Economic and Social Development Plan, 2012 [1]). 
In previous study, the relation between crop production and weather condition was evaluated. Shiraiwa 
et al. (2002) [2] estimated the regression between rice production and accumulated monthly rainfall by using 
20 years statistical data in Thailand. Rice production was strongly related with planted area rather than rice 
yield for wet season rice in Northeast Thailand. Because rainfall amount in the beginning of wet season 
significantly affect to planted area. On the other hand, rice yield was not so sensitive to rainfall amount, 
because most farmers had additional water source such as shallow ground water or small ponds in 
emergency case. Suzuki et al. (2014) [3] evaluated the relation between maize and weather condition in 
North Thailand and mentioned that maize was more sensitive to climate condition than rice. Yoshida et al. 
(2018) [4] evaluated that agricultural economic loss of sugarcane and cassava. Sugarcane yield had positive 
regression with rainfall in wet season, however cassava had negative regression because cassava was root 
vegetable. And mix farming was recommended to stabilize the farmers’ income from their agricultural land.  
Agricultural insurance protects economic loss or damage under extreme climate condition. It has great 
potential to provide value to low-income farmers and their communities, both by supporting farmers when 
severe income loss occurs and by encouraging greater investment in cropping system. However, in practice 
its effectiveness has often been constrained by the data availability. More commonly, agricultural 
microinsurance is index-based, providing farmers with guarantee depend on the performance of an index, 
rather than compensate them for economic losses actually occurred. While index -based system avoid the 
needs for cost verification of damage, it has a disadvantage in the form of “basis risk”, the difference 
between the performance of the index and the damage which farmers actually suffered. In some cases, this 
“basis risk” is quite large, but can be reduced through improvements in the index [5].  
Northeast Thailand is major agricultural producing area where regional production was more than 50% 
of wet-season rice in whole Thailand. However, the ratio of irrigated agricultural land was only 7.6% (in 
2012) and others were rain-fed so sthat agricultural production was sensitive to climate, and climate change 
makes crucial impact to the societies and economics in rural area. Sompo Japan-Thailand insurance 
company was selling index-based agricultural insurance in this region, however current selling is around 1 % 
of farmers only. In this study, we focused on weather-index insurance for climate change adaptation 
measure. To evaluate the weather index of agricultural insurance, firstly, we evaluated how affect the rainfall 
amount and patterns on rice production by regression analysis, and probability analysis also applied to 
estimate the return period of rainfall index. Secondly, agricultural damage and its impact on farmers’ 
household income was evaluated. 
 
2. Material and Methods 
 
To evaluate the impact of weather-induced economic loss of wet-season rice production in Northeast 
Thailand, two kinds of analysis were conducted in this study. Firstly, we evaluated how affect the seasonal 
rainfall amount and patterns on wet-season rice production through regression analysis by using the 
meteorological and agricultural statistic data. And return periods of rainfall index also estimated by 
DOI:10.4186/ej.2019.23.6.451 
ENGINEERING JOURNAL Volume 23 Issue 6, ISSN 0125-8281 (http://www.engj.org/) 453 
probability analysis. Secondly, household survey was conducted to grasp farmers’ conditions of water use, 
cultivation, income balance. And then, economic loss by weather induced agricultural damage was 
estimated and impact on farmers’ household income was evaluated by using the agricultural statistic and 
crop price data. 
 
2.1. Study Area 
 
In this study, we selected the Northeast region in Thailand for study area. Figure 1 shows the provincial 
administrative boundary and the location of rainfall gauges in this region. Currently, 20 provinces are 
located in Northeast Thailand, however 17 provincial area map before 1996 was used in this analysis. 
Because only 17 provincial data were available in agricultural statistic before 1997. Northeast Thailand 
covers about 168×103 km2 and coterminous with the Khorat Plateau. The Khorat plateau consists of two 
plains: one is the southern Khorat plain drained by the Mun and Chi rivers, and another is the northern 
Sakon Nakhon plain drained by the Loei and Songkhram rivers. The average temperature ranged from 
19.6 °C to 30.2 °C. Rainfall amount is unstable and concentrated in the rainy season from May to October.

Annual rainfall fluctuation was 800-1400 mm/year, and this amount was smaller than another region in 
Thailand. Therefore, agricultural production has been strongly affected by climate. The ratio of irrigated 
DOI:10.4186/ej.2019.23.6.451 
454 ENGINEERING JOURNAL Volume 23 Issue 6, ISSN 0125-8281 (http://www.engj.org/) 
agricultural land was only 7.6 % so that production was sensitive to drought condition. Current production 
data such as yield, harvested area of wet-season rice were shown in Fig. 2. Rice yield increased gradually 
caused by variety or farming practice improvement. And harvest area also gradually increased in this region. 
For weather index insurance, Sompo Japan-Thailand set three thresholds according to the timing and 
degree of drought, such as “early drought”, “drought” and “severe drought”. The compensation is a fixed 
percentage of the loan principal between BAAC (Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives) and 
each farmer, and the percentage is fixed for each threshold in advance. If the monthly rainfall in July is 
smaller than the threshold value of an “early drought”, 10% of the insurance principle is paid to farmer, 
and then the contract is terminated afterwards. If monthly rainfall in July is larger than the threshold, then 
the contract continues until the end of September. When the accumulated rainfall during August to 
September is smaller than the threshold of “drought” or “severe drought”, 15% or 40% of the insured loan 
principal is paid respectively. In case of Khon Kaen province, farmers pay 10% of their loan for insurance 
premium. And weather index was defined as “early drought” means that the sum of rainfall in July is below 
100 mm. “drought” or “severe drought” means the sum of rainfall from August to September is below 320 
mm or 220 mm respectively. 
 
2.2. Regression Analysis 
 
In Northeast Thailand, agricultural production had been affected by climate condition, especially extreme 
drought and flood. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the crop sensitivity to monthly rainfall. In this 
study, we analyzed the regression between wet-season rice production and monthly rainfall. The data of rice 
production, yield and harvested area from 1981 to 2013 were available in agricultural statistic published by 
OAE (Office of Agriculture and Economics in Thailand). And 41 stations data of monthly rainfall from 
1981 to 2013 also collected from TMD (Thai Meteorological Department) and RID (Royal Irrigation 
Department). The location of rain gauge station was shown in Fig. 1. 
Agricultural production can be calculated as following equation by multiplying three contributed 
components. 
 
        RP  = RY×PA×RHA     (1) 
 
where, RP: rice production, RY: rice yield, PA: planted area, RHA: ratio of harvested area (=harvest area/ 
planted area).  
At first, we checked which components was dominant factor to affecting rice production. the data of 
rice production, yield, planted area, and monthly rainfall were standardized as following manner, and then 
regression analysis was applied. In this study, pre-5 years average yield value was calculated and only the 
deviations from pre-5 years average were used for regression analysis to off-set the trend of technological 
change, such as variety improvement, or fertilizer and pesticide input [2].  
Among meteorological parameters, rainfall is most important factor which affect rice production 
significantly. Because air temperature was enough high during all season in Northeast Thailand. In this 
study, The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was calculated and used for regression analysis. SPI is a 
normalized index representing the probability of occurrence of an observed rainfall amount when 
compared with the rainfall at a certain monitoring station over a long-term reference period [6]. 
 
2.3. Probability Analysis 
 
The probability analysis of seasonal rainfall is important to predict the relative frequency of occurrence in 
different interval of rainfall with reasonable accuracy. The monthly accumulated rainfall data were ranked in 
descending order and various probabilistic methods were applied to determine the return period. From the 
Probabilistic methods, Gumbel, Log-normal and Normal distribution methods were used in this study. The 
rainfall data were arranged into a number of intervals with definite ranges. 
 
2.4. Estimation of Agricultural Economic Loss 
 
Agricultural economic loss was estimated from agricultural statistic and crop price data. One problem is 
how to definite the normal year condition. Crop yield of rice was gradually increased in Fig. 2 and rice

ENGINEERING JOURNAL Volume 23 Issue 6, ISSN 0125-8281 (http://www.engj.org/) 455 
production also had same trend. This might be caused by variety improvement, increasing fertilizer or 
pesticide input, etc. Such technological aspect should be removed and only the climate aspect should be 
considered. Therefore, in this study, pre-5 year average rice production was employed as the normal 
condition, and deviation from pre-5 years average was extracted shown in Fig. 3. Agricultural economic loss 
was calculated from this deviation part multiplying the crop price as following Eq. (2). 
 
                                            EL = (Pave- RP)×Price     (2) 
 
where, EL: economic loss, Pave: pre-5year average production, RP: rice production, Price: rice price.  When 
the EL value became less than zero, EL was replaced by zero to extract only damage cost.

2.5. Household Surveying 
 
To grasp the farmers’ behavior under different climate condition, oral interview to the farmers was 
conducted in 2016 and 2017. We selected three locations in Khon Kaen province, such as i) irrigated area, ii) 
rainfed upland crop area, iii) rainfed and salt affected soil area. Table1 shows the contents of questionnaire 
about household structure, water use, cultivation, livestock, non-agricultural job, etc. The total sample is 60 
households (20 farmers in each location).

3. Result and Discussion 
 
3.1. Result of Regression Analysis 
 
Regression analysis was applied to Eq. (1) to check which components was dominant factor to affecting 
rice production. Table 2 showed the partial regression coefficient between rice production and 3 
contributing components such as rice yield, planted area, ratio of harvested area (=harvest area/ planted 
area). For wet season rice, planted area was dominant in 13 provinces and rice yield was only in 4 provinces. 
Farmers might be controlling their planted area depend on the rainfall amount to compensate the yield of 
rice in wet season. From this result, rice yield was not suitable to applied correlation analysis with monthly 
rainfall data. Therefore, rice production itself was employed for checking parameter in following correlation 
analysis. 
 
Table 2. Partial regression coefficient of each components. 
 
 
 
And then, correlation analysis was applied between standardized rice production and standardized 
monthly rainfall. In this study, from 1 to 6 month accumulated rainfall was used for analysis. Wet-season 
rice production had significant positive relationship with three months accumulated rainfall (Table 3). 9 
provinces had positive correlation R>0.3 with Jun-Aug accumulated rainfall. Rice transplanting normally 
start from June or July so that rainfall in this season is quite important factor to control the rice planted 
area. On the other hand, correlation of Oct-Dec rainfall showed negative value in Nakhon Ratchasima, Si 
Saket and Surin. These provinces are located in Mun river basin having no large-scale dam so that flood 
may cause the reduction of rice production in these provinces.  Chaiyaphum, Nakon Phanom, Nong Kai, 
Ubon Ratchthani and Yasothon province didn’t have significant correlation in any season. These provinces 
has much rainfall compare with other provinces. Therefore, small change of accumulated rainfall may not 
affect rice production.  
For weather index, July-Sep rainfall was employed. From Table 3, July-Sep accumulated rainfall also 
had positive correlation with rice production in 8 provinces, therefore employed weather index period for 
insurance looked like suitable. According to the Sompo Japan-Thailand, Jun-Aug rainfall was used for their 
first trial in Khon Kaen province. However, through the discussion with the farmers, index was changed to 
July-Sep. Recently, farming practice was changed from transplanting to direct seeding due to lack of labor 
power in Khon Kaen, after that rainfall amount of beginning stage (in June) became not so important for 
rice cultivation.

3.2. Result of Probability Analysis 
 
From the Probability analysis on the monthly rainfall for Khon Kaen province, it was evident that Normal 
distribution was insufficient and Gumbel distribution was ascertained as the best fit distribution (Fig. 4). 
Table 4 showed estimated monthly rainfall in each return period in Khon Kaen province. In Khon Kaen, 
“early drought” means that the sum of rainfall in July is less than 100 mm and estimated return period is 4 
years. “drought” or “severe drought” means the sum of rainfall from August to September is less than 320 
mm or 220 mm, and therefore those return periods was estimated as 5 years and 30 years, respectively. In 
this case, expected payment per year from insurance was around 5.75％ of farmers’ loan amount, while 
farmers’ payment for insurance is 10% of loan amount.

3.3. Result of Agricultural Economic Loss 
 
Agricultural economic loss during 1981-2013 due to drought or flood was estimated. Figure 5 shows 
estimated economic loss of wet-season rice in each province of Northeast Thailand. Maximum economic 
loss was estimated around 2,000 million Baht in Udon Thani province in 1988, and in recent year also some 
province had 600 million Baht economic loss. In 2000, total production value of wet-season rice in each 
province were ranged from 460 million Baht (Mukdahan) to 4,160 million Baht (Surin) so that 600 million 
Baht economic loss was enough large in provincial level.

3.4. Economic Damage on Farmers Household Income 
 
From the 60 farmers’ interview results, average agricultural land area was 2.59 ha and all farmers had paddy 
field to produce rice for household. Average household income was about 34×104 Baht /year, consisting of 
12×104 Baht/year from agriculture and 22×104 Baht/year from non-agriculture. Figure 6 shows farmers 
agricultural and non-agricultural income change. Figure 6 contains not only questionnaire data but also 
DOI:10.4186/ej.2019.23.6.451 
ENGINEERING JOURNAL Volume 23 Issue 6, ISSN 0125-8281 (http://www.engj.org/) 459 
contain the oral interview data by OAE (in 1983, 1988, 1992, 1996, 1999). Around 35% of total income 
from agriculture and 65% came from non-agriculture, and the balance of agricultural and non-agricultural 
income was not change so much. Most of agricultural land was classified as rainfed in this area, so 61% of 
farmers answered that agricultural income from rice or upland crop cultivation were unstable. 
 
 
 
Fig. 6. Variation of farmers’ agricultural and non-agricultural income. 
 
By using the interview results, impact of agricultural economic loss on farmers’ household income was 
estimated. In this calculation, we employed as following assumptions: 1) agricultural land area was 2.59 
ha/household; 2) the ratio of agri- (35%) and non-agri (65%) income was not change during 1988-2013; 3) 
total household income can be interpolated by liner increase from data of Fig. 6; 4) agricultural economic 
loss per ha can be used from the data of Fig. 5.  
 
 
 
Fig. 7. Impact of agricultural damage on farmers’ income. 
 
Figure 7 shows impact of agricultural economic loss on farmers’ household income in insurance selling 
province assuming wet-season rice cultivation. Average farmers’ income from paddy rice cultivation 
increased from 3,947 Baht/year/ha (1981) to 21.564 Baht/year/ha (2013) due to productivity improvement 
and crop price increase. Before 2000, more than 6 % economic loss was estimated every 3 years in some 
provinces, however it declined less than 3% in recent year. During 1981-2013, consumer price index 
became 2.5 times, and farmers’ income became 13 times. Therefore, recent agricultural damage will not 
DOI:10.4186/ej.2019.23.6.451 
460 ENGINEERING JOURNAL Volume 23 Issue 6, ISSN 0125-8281 (http://www.engj.org/) 
make large impact on farmers’ livelihood in this case. On the other hand, full-time farmers had relatively 
larger impact than part-time farmers. Therefore, full-time farmers are still potential buyer of insurance. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In this study, we focused on agricultural economic damages and effectiveness of index-based insurance 
system in northeast Thailand. Firstly, we evaluated the regression between the seasonal rainfall amount and 
rice production by using the agricultural statistic from OAE and meteorological data from TMD and RID. 
Wet-season rice had significant positive relationship with 3 months accumulated rainfall. 8 provinces had 
positive correlation R>0.3 with Jul-Sep accumulated rainfall which was employed for insurance index. And 
then, probability analysis was applied to monthly rainfall. In Khon Kaen, “early drought” means that the 
monthly rainfall in July is less than 100 mm and estimated return period is 4 years. “drought” or “severe 
drought” means the accumulated rainfall from August to September is less than 320 mm or 220 mm, and 
those return periods was estimated as 5 years and 30 years, respectively. In this case, expected payment per 
year from insurance was around 5.75％ of farmers’ loan amount, while farmer pay 10% of their loan. As a 
result, setting amount and periods of insurance index was suitable.  
Secondly, household survey was conducted to grasp farmers’ conditions of water use, cultivation, 
income balance. From the 60 famers interview results, average household income was about 34×104 Baht 
/year, consisting of 12×104 Baht/year from agriculture and 22×104 Baht/year from non-agriculture. Even 
in recent year, about 600 million Baht economic loss was estimated in some province. Total production 
value of wet-season rice in each province were ranged from 460 million Baht (Mukdahan) to 4,160 million 
Baht (Surin) in 2000 so that 600 million Baht economic loss was enough large in provincial level. However, 
recent agricultural damage was not so large for part-time farmers, because most part of farmers’ income 
relied on non-agricultural sector. That might be the one reason of constraints of insurance sales.
