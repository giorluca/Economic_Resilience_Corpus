During the height of the recession, going from March 2020 to April 2020, the national sea-sonally adjusted unemployment rate went from 4.4 percent to 14.8 percent. The num-ber of those unemployed during that time went from an estimated 7,185,000 in March to 23,109,000 in April. As of May 2021, the national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8 percent, or an estimated 9,316,000 people still left unemployed. How-ever, many companies, both big and small, are having a hard time finding qualified workers to fill their job openings. According to a survey conducted by the National Fed-eration of Independent Business, a record-high 48 percent of small business owners in May reported having unfilled job openings.  A net 28% of owners reported raising com-pensation (up three points) and the highest level in the past 12 months. A net 17% plan to raise compensation in the next three months, down two points. Seven percent of owners cited labor costs as their top business problem and 24% said that labor quality was their top business problem. Finding eligible workers to fill open positions will become increasingly difficult for small business owners.  Analysts from Reuters, an international news organization, have listed six reasons as to why people are still staying out of the job market:  • Parents, mainly mothers, cannot work because closures or shortened hours at schools and daycares keep them home to watch their children. • Would-be workers remain concerned about health risks amid the current pan-demic. • Stock-market gains have given some older workers the money they need to retire.  • Several younger workers are finding jobs in new fields, thus shrinking the labor pool for industries they left be-hind. • Many employers need to fill jobs requir-ing skills that sidelined workers may not have. • Employers complain that enhanced un-employment benefits and other govern-ment aid are keeping workers on the sidelines.  Some jobs that have disappeared will also not be coming back because of the ways we work, shop, and live have changed over the year. Professional and business services had a decline of 111,000 jobs in temporary help during the pandemic, while support services lost 15,000 positions. Courier help declined by 77,000 jobs and manufacturing declined by 18,000 jobs.  In May 2021, national seasonally adjusted employment in leisure and hospitality in-creased by 292,000 jobs, as pandemic-related restrictions continued to ease in many parts of the country. Most of the in-creases were in accommodation and food services (up 220,600 jobs). Arts, entertain-ment, and recreation saw an increase of 71,700 jobs over the month. Although leisure and hospitality has added around 4.2 million jobs over the year, employment in that in-dustry is still down 2.5 million, or about 15 percent, since February 2020.  In Tennessee, the seasonally adjusted em-ployment in leisure and hospitality during May 2021 increased by 3,000 jobs. Arts, en-tertainment, and recreation increased by around 1,200 jobs over the month. Leisure and hospitality is up around 59,300 jobs over the year, but it is still down by 46,300 jobs, or about 13.2 percent, since February 2020.  Job seekers in Tennessee can find more than 255,000 open positions employers need to fill on the state’s workforce development web-site, www.Jobs4TN.gov.  The Tennessee Virtual American Job Center (VAJC) www.TNVirtualAJC.com allows Tennes-seans to research different programs that can help them remove barriers to employ-ment so they can more easily reenter Ten-nessee’s workforce. The VAJC allows job seek-ers to do this on their schedule, anytime, an-ywhere.

include all full- and part-time nonfarm wage and salary employ-ees who worked during or received pay for any part of the pay period that includes the 12th of the month.  This is a count of jobs by place of work.  Agricultural workers, proprietors, self-employed persons, workers in private households, and unpaid family workers are excluded. These numbers may not add due to rounding.  Data are based on the 2020 benchmark. Total nonfarm employment increased by 230,100 jobs from May 2020 to May 2021. There were increases in leisure & hospitali-ty (up 57,900 jobs), which includes increas-es of 36,600 jobs in food services & drink-ing places; manufacturing (up 47,100 jobs), which includes increases of 39,200 jobs in durable goods manufacturing; profession-al & business services (up 46,500), which includes increases of 29,300 jobs in admin-istrative/support/waste management; trade/transportation/utilities (up 38,100 jobs), which includes increases of 20,600 jobs in retail trade.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in nursing & residential care facilities (down 5,300 jobs); food & bever-age stores (down 1,300 jobs); truck trans-portation (down 1,200 jobs); construction of buildings (down 800 jobs).     During the past month, nonfarm employ-ment increased by 21,200 jobs. There were increases in leisure & hospitality (up 10,200 jobs), which include increases of 4,500 jobs in food services & drinking places; profes-sional & business services (up 4,700 jobs), which includes increases of 3,300 jobs in administrative/support/waste manage-ment; financial activities (up 4,000 jobs), which includes increases of 2,900 jobs in real estate/rental/leasing.    These increases were partially offset by decreases in state government educational services (down 5,000 jobs; educational ser-vices (down 1,600 jobs); truck transporta-tion (down 900 jobs); local government educational services (down 600 jobs).  Tennessee's seasonally adjusted estimated unemployment rate for May 2021 was 5.0 percent, unchanged from the revised April 2021 rate. The United States unemploy-ment rate for May 2021 was 5.8 percent, down from the revised April 2021 rate of 6.1 percent. In May 2020, the U.S. seasonal-ly adjusted rate was 13.3 percent while the state rate was 9.6 percent.   The not seasonally adjusted unemploy-ment rate decreased in 40 counties, in-creased in 37 counties, and remained the same in 18 counties. Moore County and Williamson County had the lowest rate at 2.7 percent, both down from the revised April rate of 2.9 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively. The highest rate was Perry County at 7.1 percent, down from the re-vised unemployment rate of 8.4 percent in April. 5 Civilian Labor Force Summary U.S. TENNESSEE U.S. TENNESSEE Labor Force Employment

These increases were partially offset by de-creases in educational & health services (down 1,400 jobs), which includes decreases of 1,200 jobs in educational services; government and other services (down 200 jobs).   During the past 12 months, nonfarm employ-ment increased by 96,900 jobs. During that time, goods-producing jobs increased by 17,600 jobs, while service-providing jobs in-creased by 79,300 jobs.
