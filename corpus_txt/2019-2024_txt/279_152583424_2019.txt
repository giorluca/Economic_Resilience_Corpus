Food securitystatus was assessed using the US Household Food Security Survey Module: Six-Item Short Form.Logistic regression models, crude and adjusted for sex, age, education, and household income per-ception, were performed.Results: The prevalence of food insecurity was 16.6%. Women (odds ratio [OR] ¼ 1.96; 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-3.54), those less educated (OR ¼ 5.46; 95% CI: 2.84-10.46), andthose who had the perception of an insufficient household income (OR ¼ 10.39; 95% CI: 5.00-21.56) were more likely to belong to a food insecure household. Unmarried individuals (OR ¼1.79; 95% CI: 1.05-3.06) and lower white-collar workers (OR ¼ 2.22; 95% CI: 1.03-4.77) were1 EPIUnit - Instituto de Saúde Pública, Universidade do Porto, Rua das Taipas, Porto, Portugal2 Departamento de Ciências da Saúde Pública e Forenses e Educação Médica, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade do Porto,Alameda Prof. Hernâni Monteiro, Porto, Portugal3 EpiDoC Unit, Centro de Estudos de Doenças Crónicas, NOVA Medical School, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal4 Sociedade Portuguesa de Reumatologia, Lisboa, Portugal5 Serviço de Reumatologia do Hospital Egas Moniz, Centro Hospitalar Lisboa Ocidental, Lisboa, PortugalCorresponding Author:Isabel Maia, EPIUnit - Instituto de Saúde Pública, Universidade do Porto, Rua das Taipas n 135, 4050-600 Porto, Portugal.Email: isabel.maia@ispup.up.ptFood and Nutrition Bulletin2019, Vol. 40(4) 504-513ª The Author(s) 2019Article reuse guidelines:sagepub.com/journals-permissionsDOI: 10.1177/0379572119858170journals.sagepub.com/home/fnbalso more prone to live within a food insecure household, regardless of sex, age, education, andhousehold income perception.Conclusions: The obtained information is valuable for the development of intervention strategies toreduce food insecurity in middle- and older-aged adults, suggesting that women, unmarried, lesseducated individuals, less skilled workers, and lower income families should be targeted.Keywordsfood insecurity, adults, prevalence, social determinants of health, EPIPortoIntroductionFood insecurity (FI) is a worldwide public healthproblem. Highly prevalent among low- and middle-income countries, FI is also a relevant issue in high-income countries,1-5 due to the increasing trend inunemployment, poverty, and social inequalitiesderived from the global financial crisis.6Unemployment rates markedly increased dur-ing the economic crisis in Portugal.7 Despitebeing transversal among different age groups, ithas been shown to be a more relevant issue inmiddle-aged adults, due to the psychological con-sequences, their family responsibilities8 and thegreater difficulty in becoming reemployed, whenfacing unemployment. As middle-aged adults seetheir income reduced, they are more prone toexperiencing FI.9 Moreover, older-aged adults arevulnerable to FI, which was linked to physicallimitations, health-related conditions, and socialisolation.10,11 As older-aged adults are more likelyto have chronic disease, they could be faced tochoose between food or medication,12 a situationthat probably worsened during the economic crisis.In Portugal, according to the results from theFourth National Health Survey (IV-NHS) (2005/2006),13 about 1 in 6 citizens faced FI.14 However,this survey was performed before the 2008 eco-nomic crisis. More recently, data from a nationalsurvey conducted during the period of full-blowneconomic crisis described a much higher preva-lence of FI in 2013 (50.7%),15 suggesting the influ-ence of macroeconomic indicators on FI burden.Therefore, to monitor the prevalence of FI and itsdeterminants in population-based studies is stillrequired to inform national public health policiesdirected toward promoting food security for all,particularly among the mentioned age strata.FI has been associated with a range of negativenutritional and health outcomes.16,17 As a conse-quence of inaccessible or inadequate food supply,members of food insecure households tend tochange their food habits and adopt inadequate andnutritionally poorer dietary patterns.18-20 This sit-uation may increase the risk of overweight andobesity, which is known as the FI-obesityparadox.18,20,21One major and strong established determinantof FI is household income.22,23 Also, neighbor-hood deprivation,22 belonging to larger house-holds,24 being unmarried,22 and less educated14are described to be associated with FI. Sex differ-ences in FI have also been reported, being theprevalence higher in women.14,22Research on FI has been increasing, namely inpopulation-based samples, however studies on FIare still greatly focused on disadvantaged popula-tions,25-28 which reinforces the need for a deeperinsight into the determinants of FI in urban popu-lations from high-income countries, across a widesocioeconomic spectrum.Therefore, and considering the aforemen-tioned vulnerability of middle- and older-agedadults, this study aimed to estimate the preva-lence and to identify the determinants of FIduring the economic crisis recovery in apopulation-based sample of urban middle- andolder-aged Portuguese adults.MethodsStudy Design and ParticipantsA cross-sectional study based on data from EPIPortocohort was conducted. As previously described,29EPIPorto is a cohort of noninstitutionalizedMaia et al 505Portuguese Caucasian inhabitants of Porto, Portugal,assembled between 1999 and 2003 and aged 18 ormore years at recruitment. Households were selectedby random digit dialing of landline telephones.Within each household, a permanent resident wasselected by simple random sampling. The participa-tion rate at cohort assembling was 70% correspond-ing to 2485 participants.29The second evaluation took place between2005 and 2008, including 1682 participants. Athird evaluation occurred between 2013 and2015, and 995 individuals were re-evaluated. Aspart of this third cohort evaluation, in addition tothe face-to-face interviews on which sociodemo-graphic data were collected, computer-assistedtelephone interviews were conducted, betweenApril 2014 and January 2016, with the purposeof food security status assessment. Of the 995evaluated, 604 participants were included in thepresent study, as they fulfilled the inclusion cri-teria of to have 50 years of age or more and to beresponsible or co-responsible for cooking and/orbuying food for the household.30Regarding baseline characteristics, partici-pants, in comparison with nonparticipants, hadlower mean (standard deviation, SD) age (66.9[8.4] vs 71.2 [12.5] years; P < .001) and weremore educated (26.9% vs 19.6% with more than12 years of schooling; P < .001). No significantdifferences for sex and working status (reportedat third evaluation) were found.The ethics committee of São João UniversityHospital, Porto approved the study. EPIPorto wasapproved by the Portuguese Data ProtectionAuthority. All participants gave their writteninformed consent.Data CollectionData of the third EPIPorto evaluation were col-lected by trained interviewers using structuredquestionnaires.Sociodemographic characteristics. Sex, age, andeducation, as completed years of schooling, wererecorded. Education was categorized into “4years,” “5 to 9 years,” “10 to 12 years,” and“>12 years.” Information regarding occupationwas classified according to the 2010 PortugueseClassification of Occupations (PCO)31 and fur-ther recategorized into 3 categories: upperwhite-collar, lower white-collar, and blue-collar.The upper white-collar category included ArmedForces Occupations, Managers, Professionals,and Technicians and associate professionals, cor-responding to the upper 4 major groups of thePCO. The lower white-collar category consistedof Clerical support workers and Service and salesworkers, classified in the fourth and fifth majorgroups of the PCO. Lastly, the blue-collar cate-gory encompassed participants from the sixth toninth groups, namely skilled agricultural, forestryand fishery workers, craft and related tradesworkers, plant and machine operators and assem-blers, and elementary occupations.Regarding working status, individuals wereclassified as employed, unemployed, retired, andhousewives.Marital status was collected and classified intosingle, married or civil partnership, divorced, andwidowed. Participants were also asked about thehousehold size as the number of persons living inthe household, which was categorized into 1 per-son, 2 persons, and 3 persons. Average house-hold monthly income was recorded into thefollowing categories: lower than €500, €500 to€1000, €1001 to €1500, €1501 to €2000, andhigher than €2000. Information regarding thehousehold income perception as “insufficient,”“need to be careful about expenses,” “enough tomeet needs,” or “comfortable” was also collected.Food security status assessment. Food security sta-tus was evaluated using the US Household FoodSecurity Survey Module: Six-Item Short Form32derived from the original 18-Item US HouseholdFood Security Survey Module,33 which wastranslated to the Portuguese language by theresearch team (Cronbach a ¼ .748).With regard to the previous 12 months, indi-viduals were asked about the food eaten in theirhouseholds and whether they were able to affordthe food they need. The participants’ householdswere classified into “food security” if the numberof affirmative responses was equal to or less thanone, “low food security” if there were between 2and 4 affirmative responses or “very low food506 Food and Nutrition Bulletin 40(4)security” if the number of affirmative responseswas 5 or 6.32Statistical AnalysisContinuous variables were summarized as meanand SD. Categorical variables were described asabsolute and relative frequencies. Continuousvariables were compared using Student’s t-testor analysis of variance, while, for proportions, thew2 test, Fisher’s exact test, or the Monte Carlosimulation were used, as appropriate.Unconditional logistic regression models werecomputed to assess the associations between foodsecurity status and sociodemographic variables.Odds ratios (ORs) and respective 95% confidenceintervals (95% CIs) were estimated. For the pur-pose of regression analyses, food security statuswas classified into “food security” and “FI”(including both participants from low and verylow food security categories). Covariates suchas sex, age, marital status, education, occupation,working status, household monthly income,household income perception, and household sizewere tested, and the final model of adjustmentincluded sex, age, education, and householdincome perception.Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSSStatistics 25.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York).A significance level of 5% was adopted.ResultsA larger proportion of individuals were women(67.9%) and, at the time of food security statusevaluation, individuals had between 50 and90 years of age (mean [SD] of 66.9 [8.4] years).Regarding food security status, 83.4% of individ-uals’ households were food secure, while 13.9%and 2.6% were classified as low and very lowfood secure, respectively.Individuals from both low and very low foodsecure households had slightly higher mean age(P ¼ .220) and were more frequently less edu-cated ( 4 years of schooling; P < .001) andunmarried (P ¼ .058) than participants from foodsecure households. Individuals belonging to lowfood secure households were more frequentlylower white-collar workers (P < .001), had anaverage household monthly income between€500 and €1000 (P < .001) and were also morelikely to refer need to be careful about expenses(P < .001) than individuals from food securehouseholds. In contrast, participants from verylow food secure households were more frequentlyblue-collar workers (P < .001), with an averagehousehold monthly income lower than €500 (P <.001), and were more prone to consider theirhousehold income as insufficient (P < .001) thanindividuals from food secure households (Table1).Regarding the characteristics associated withFI, we observed that women (OR¼ 2.27; 95% CI:1.33-3.86), less educated (OR ¼ 7.21; 95%CI: 4.05-12.84), unmarried participants (OR ¼1.76; 95% CI: 1.13-2.73), and lower white-collar (OR ¼ 4.96; 95% CI: 2.60-9.44) or blue-collar workers (OR ¼ 6.13; 95% CI: 3.17-11.86)had a higher odds of belonging to a food insecurehousehold (Table 2). Also, to be unemployed(OR ¼ 3.66; 95% CI: 1.41-9.46), retired (OR ¼2.21; 95% CI: 1.18-4.14), or to be a housewife(OR ¼ 3.28; 95% CI: 1.32-8.16), and reporting alow (OR ¼ 11.46; 95% CI: 5.67-23.17) or aninsufficient household income (OR ¼ 14.73;95% CI: 7.37-29.46) were significantly associ-ated with FI (Table 2).In multiple regression analyses, we observedthat independently of sex, age, education andhousehold income perception, unmarried individ-uals (OR ¼ 1.79; 95% CI: 1.05-3.06), and lowerwhite-collar workers (OR ¼ 2.22; 95% CI: 1.03-4.77) were more prone to live within a food inse-cure household. To be woman (OR ¼ 1.96; 95%CI: 1.09-3.54), as well as to be less educated(OR ¼ 5.46; 95% CI: 2.84-10.46), remainedsignificantly associated with FI, independentlyof age and household income perception. Theperception of an insufficient household incomewas strongly and positively associated with FI(OR ¼ 10.39; 95% CI: 5.00-21.56), regardlessof sex, age, and education (Table 2).DiscussionA relevant prevalence of FI (16.6%) wasobserved among middle- and older-aged adultsof EPIPorto cohort.Maia et al 507Considering the importance of a periodicalmonitoring of FI, our study provides a relevantcontribution regarding the scenario of FI and theidentification of its determinants in Portugal dur-ing a particular period—the economic crisisrecovery (namely characterized by a decrease inunemployment7)—using a population-based sam-ple of middle- and older-aged urban adults fromdifferent socioeconomic positions.Our estimate was identical to the prevalence ofFI previously described in the Portuguese house-holds, assessed through the same scale, in the IV-NHS (2005-2006).14 This could suggest a similarburden of FI as in previous years of the economiccrisis. The observed discrepancies in the preva-lence of FI cannot be solely attributed to the studyyear. In 2003, a Portuguese survey only using asingle question reported 8.1% of FI.34 MoreTable 1.

These estimates are muchhigher than our FI prevalence, even for the North-ern region (46.0%, 49.1%, and 50.7% in 2011,2012, and 2013, respectively).15 However, theINFOFAMILIA sample, when compared to ours,is comprised of a lower proportion of higher edu-cated and retired people and of a higher propor-tion of unemployed individuals.36 Even that, arecent study reported an FI prevalence of 27.9%for Portuguese individuals aged 50 years andolder, using an adapted version of the BrazilianFood Insecurity Scale.37As this comparison shows differences in pre-valence estimates could be also considered as aconsequence of diversified methodology in eval-uating FI. Actually, the IV-NHS used the USHousehold Food Security Survey Module: Six-Item Short-Form as we did, while the INFOFA-MÍLIA survey applied an adapted version of theBrazilian Food Insecurity Scale.

Likewise, it is worth noting that themethods concerning the selection of participantswere different in IV-NHS and INFOFAMÍLIA.Nonetheless, among more recent studies, evenusing the same scale, differences in the preva-lence of FI are observable. Using the US House-hold Food Security Survey Module, a prevalenceof FI of 12.7% in the United States,38 8.3% inCanada,39 and 6.3% in the metropolitan area ofParis4 were estimated, although a modified ver-sion of the US Household Food Security SurveyModule was used in this last study. All these esti-mates were lower than the prevalence of FI thatwe estimated. Even when comparing to Francethat has a similar Gini coefficient—as a generalmeasure of income inequality at country level—to Portugal,40 there are differences in the preva-lence of FI, which suggests the role of othersocioeconomic determinants beyond income.In our sample, FI seemed to be determined bydifferent sociodemographic characteristics. At atime of economic crisis recovery, we observed thatto be woman, unmarried, less educated, and havinga lower white-collar occupation, as well as to havea perception of insufficient household income,showed to be associated with FI. These results arein accordance with findings from studies fromPortugal14,37 and from other countries.4,22,28Women were more likely to be food insecure,as they have an increased awareness of theirhousehold’s food supply and concern with theprotection of all household members, which maylead to a stronger willingness to abdicate theirfood intake in favor of other family members.22As expected, the perception of an insufficienthousehold income revealed to be strongly andpositively associated with FI, even more thanhousehold monthly income. In our analysis,although household monthly income and house-hold income perception were closely related,household income perception may represent amore accurate measure of the economic situationof the household since it probably reflects theadequacy of the household income to the needs.41Regarding occupation, in the final adjustedmodel, only lower white-collar workers remainedsignificantly associated with FI, which is inagreement with a previous study conducted inFrance.4 Lower educational level also remaineda strong determinant of FI independent of sex,age, and household income perception.Contrarily to previous evidence,24 householdsize was not significantly associated with FI. Inour sample, the majority of participants belong toa single or a two-person household (65.7%).Thus, it is possible that low variability concerninghousehold size may have contributed to theabsence of differences in food security status.As opposed to previous results,4,24,42 in ourstudy, we did not observe significant findingsconcerning age. Differences in these results canbe partly explained by the age range of our sam-ple (50-90 years old), which is less heterogeneousthan in other studies. Additionally, even thoughMarkwick et al24 had pointed out that youngerindividuals are more prone to be food insecure,when comparisons were established with thoseaged 55 to 64 years to those aged 65 years andolder, no significant differences were observed,which corroborates our results.This study confirms findings from previousstudies that individuals from less favorable socio-economic contexts seemed to be more prone toFI. These results portray the need for the devel-opment of public health policies to support thesepopulations in order to diminish its FI burden,particularly in countries facing periods of eco-nomic vulnerability.This study had some limitations that ought tobe mentioned. One of the limitations is its cross-sectional design, which does not allow for infer-ence about causality. In addition, the possibilityof bias cannot be discarded. Although food secu-rity data were collected by computer-assistedtelephone interview, one cannot preclude theoccurrence of social desirability bias, but webelieved that its impact was small. As FI is adelicate issue, misclassification of participantsmay have occurred, as individuals may haveomitted the real condition of their household,which could have led to an underestimation ofthe FI. Also, information was self-reported, asFI is usually evaluated, but we cannot discard thatindividuals could describe their households asmore or less food insecure than it was in reality.43Subsequent losses throughout follow-up or una-vailability/refusal to respond are more frequent inindividuals from lower socioeconomic position,510 Food and Nutrition Bulletin 40(4)which may have led to an underestimation of theFI burden. When we compared participants andnonparticipants, statistically significant differ-ences were observed for age and education, beingthe participants younger and more educated thannonparticipants. The differences could be justi-fied since more educated individuals are morelikely to accept to participate. Finally, we haveto acknowledge that the US Household FoodSecurity Survey Module: Six-Item Short-Formis not fully validated for this sample. Neverthe-less, the Cronbach a was calculated (a ¼ .748)and indicated a good internal consistency.44This study is strengthened by the fact that datawere obtained from a large population–basedurban cohort, located in a high-income country,while previous studies were more focused inmore deprived, disadvantaged, or vulnerable set-tings. It is also noteworthy that we have used awidely accepted tool,32,33 translated to Portu-guese, for the assessment of FI, which allowscomparisons with results from other settings.Despite the US Household Food Security SurveyModule: Six-Item Short-Form does not includequestions regarding food security in children,we believe this fact may have not impacted in ourestimates, as the selected EPIPorto participantswere older (50 years of age) and mainly belong-ing to single or two-person households (65.7%),thus the household is unlikely to be composed ofchildren. Additionally, the methodological optionof restricting the food security survey to partici-pants who were responsible or co-responsible forcooking and/or buying food for the householdmay have increased the accuracy of our estimateof household FI prevalence.At a time of economic crisis recovery, a con-siderable prevalence of FI was observed amongmiddle- and older-aged adults in a large Portu-guese urban center. The obtained information isvaluable for the development of intervention stra-tegies to reduce FI in adults, suggesting thatwomen, unmarried, lower educated individuals,less skilled workers, and lower income familiesshould be targeted.AcknowledgmentsThe authors gratefully acknowledge the participantsenrolled in EPIPorto for their kindness, and allmembers of the research team for their enthusiasm andperseverance.Declaration of Conflicting InterestsThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interestwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publi-cation of this article.FundingThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following finan-cial support for the research, authorship, and/or publi-cation of this article: This work was supported bycontributions from Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norwaythrough the European Economic Area Grants, underthe Public Health Initiatives Programme (PT 06, grantnumber 118SI2).
