Various energy saving and resource recovery options have been developed and applied in the food and drink industry to minimize the sector’s energy consumption. However, there is limited understanding of their environmental and economic implications and a whole systems approach is needed to identify the most sustainable options for improving the sustainability of the sector. Therefore, this PhD research aimed at addressing part of this gap by looking at potential energy saving and resource recovery options available for two key food and drink products in the UK, cheddar cheese and coffee. In the case of coffee, ground and instant coffee products have been considered as follows: espresso, latte, cappuccino, americano, drip-filter, coffee pods, spray-dried instant, freeze-dried instant, and instant mix. This has been achieved by evaluating their environmental and economic sustainability via life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle costing (LCC), and economic value added (VA). The findings of the environmental and economic assessments have been integrated using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) and eco-efficiency tools to identify the most sustainable options in the cheese and coffee sectors. For the cheese sector, the focus has been on energy efficiency options in the manufacturing process and valorisation of whey wastage considering a base case that reflects current practices where whey is treated as wastewater (Option 1), heat integration (Option 2), a combination of heat integration with whey valorisation via anaerobic digestion to produce biogas (Option 3), and via fermentation to produce bioethanol and animal feed (Option 4). The results indicate that Option 4 is the best across all impacts and costs as this reduces gate-to-gate climate change (CC) impact by 112% and LCC by 158% compared to the base case. Also, 14 out of the other 18 impacts estimated for Option 4 are net negative. Option 3, on the other hand, has higher environmental impacts than the current practice, making it the worst alternative. At the UK sectoral level, the implementation of Option 4 changes could reduce the annual CC impact of the UK’s food and drink sector by around 0.15% and primary energy demand by 0.34%, while increasing the VA of cheese by up to 11%.  For the coffee sector, various opportunities for improvement have been evaluated along the life cycle. In the case of the end-of-life treatment of spent coffee grounds (SCGs), five different treatment and valorisation options have been considered: i) fuel pelletizing; ii) combination of transesterification and pyrolysis; iii) pyrolysis; iv) combination of transesterification and fermentation; and v) anaerobic digestion. At the production stage, emissions from roasting and the packaging are the main hotspots 19  for ground and instant coffee. To minimize the impacts, silverskin wastage from roasting can be used as fuel and the packaging of ground and instant coffees can be changed. Consequently, the CC and other impacts of the industry could be reduced by 4.3-4.5% and 0.1-43.7%, respectively. At the consumption stage, three functional units have been considered: one serving, 1 l of coffee, and 100 mg of caffeine. Freeze-dried and spray-dried instant coffees are the most sustainable for one serving and 1 l while coffee pods are the best product per 100 mg of caffeine. For the valorisation of SCGs, the results show that pyrolysis is preferable as it is the best for six out of 19 environmental impact categories, including the CC impact, also being the best for economic sustainability. The eco-efficiency results suggest that espresso is the most eco-efficient type of coffee and could be further improved if SCGs are treated and valorised via pyrolysis.  This study has also demonstrated that energy saving and resource recovery options are not necessarily more sustainable than current practices. Therefore, implementing such options must be considered on a case by case basis and analysed across the whole life cycle taking a whole systems approach. 20  Declaration No portion of the work referred to in the thesis has been submitted in support of an application for another degree or qualification of this or any other university or other institute of learning Copyright Statement The author of this thesis (including any appendices and/or schedules to this thesis) owns certain copyright or related rights in it (the “Copyright”) and s/he has given The University of Manchester certain rights to use such Copyright, including for administrative purposes.

Chapter 1 22  Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1  Background The food and drink sector accounts for around 95 EJ/year which correspond to 30% of worldwide energy consumption [1]. Fossil fuels are the main energy source used to provide the requirements across the industry’s supply chain including mechanical, electrical, and thermal energy [2,3]. The last two are of particular interest in the food and drink sector. Electricity is used to drive electric motors in the different types of equipment employed such as refrigerators, and mixers, which transform electrical energy into mechanical energy. Process heat is generated from burning natural gas or biomass burned in boilers, dryers and ovens. The food and drink industry typically sources energy from utilities companies and in some cases this is produced onsite [4]. One of the main environmental issues associated with energy production from fossil fuels is the generation of pollutants such as greenhouse gases (GHG), NOx, and SOx, which are major contributors to well-known environmental impacts including global warming and acidification potentials [5]. For example, in the UK the food and drink manufacturing sector is responsible for around 12% of the total energy consumed across the industrial sector [6], thus releasing about 8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent [7]. In addition, the food and drink sector is responsible for the generation of 1.7 million tonnes of waste that ends up in landfills or wastewater treatment facilities [8]. Such waste includes unavoidable food waste, e.g. losses throughout the supply chain, solid waste, e.g. food and packaging, wastewater, and other liquid effluents, e.g. cooking oil [9]. Food waste represents an unnecessary use of energy and generation of GHG emissions and it occurs throughout the life cycle of food production including cultivation and harvesting the raw materials, and as a result from inefficiencies in the manufacturing and storage of product, which is often perishable [9]. Although some of the food waste streams are unavoidable, they are recognised as potential sources of energy which could be recovered via energy saving and recovery technologies [10]. A more detailed discussion of the available technologies is presented in Section 1.3.5.  From an economic perspective, energy consumption is becoming an increasingly important issue due to the rising cost of electricity and process heat, as well as energy losses resulting from low efficiencies of heat transformation equipment [11]. As a response to these sustainability issues, the UK government created a “Food 2030” strategy for a sustainable and secure food system by 2030 [12]. The strategy’s main priorities are to minimize the consumption of resources and reduce GHG emissions, Chapter 1 23  to make sure that food systems are resilient, profitable and competitive, and to make a low carbon food system in which any waste is reused, recycled or used as energy sources [12,13]. In order to meet the strategy’s main priorities, special attention must be paid to energy savings and recovery measures along the food and drink supply chain.  Various energy saving and recovery technologies have been developed and applied in the food and drink industry over the last decade in an effort to consume energy in a more efficient way across the sector [14]. However, there is a lack of understanding around the environmental and economic implications of such solutions on a life cycle basis [15]. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate these solutions employing a whole systems approach to identify the most viable solutions for saving and recovering energy in the food and drink sector in the most sustainable way possible. This PhD research study looked at assessing the environmental and economic sustainability of selected food and drink products on a life cycle basis in order to identify opportunities for energy savings and resource recovery. This work was carried out by combining and applying environmental and economic sustainability tools, such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC), to evaluate the environmental and economic sustainability of different energy saving and resource recovery technologies across different selected food and drink products. The findings from this work will enable a better understanding of the implications of energy saving and resource recovery options to aid decision making across various stakeholders in the food and drink industry, such as manufacturers, retailers, consumers and policy makers. The following sections present the aims, objectives and novelty of this research, followed by a literature review and methodology used in the study. The structure of this thesis is given at the end of this chapter. 1.2  Aims, objectives and novelty The aim of this work was to assess the environmental and economic sustainability of different solutions available for energy saving and resource recovery in different product systems in the food and drink sector with the ultimate goal of informing the above-mentioned stakeholders. The study is based in the UK.  Chapter 1 24  The specific objectives of this work were: - to identify and select the food and drink products based on high consumption and energy usage, environmental impacts, and/or great economic value; - to quantify the life cycle environmental and economic sustainability of the selected food and drink products based on current practice; - to assess the sustainability of different energy saving and resource recovery options applicable to the selected food and drink products; - to identify sustainability trade-offs across the different energy saving and resource recovery options studied for the selected food and drink products at various levels (consumer, sectoral and national);  - to identify the most sustainable energy saving and resource recovery technologies for the selected food and drink products and make recommendations to key stakeholders. As discussed in the methods section, the products selected based on the above-mentioned criteria are cheddar cheese and coffee (ground and instant) consumed in the UK. To the best knowledge of the author, this is the first sustainability assessment of energy saving and resource recovery options applied to cheese and coffee products. The main novelties of this research include: - development of process flowsheets for production of the selected food and drink products; - integration of process design and modelling tools with sustainability assessment methods (LCA and LCC); - assessment of the environmental and economic sustainability of energy saving and resource recovery options applied to the selected food and drink products; - identification of the environmental and economic sustainability trade-offs of the energy saving and resource recovery technologies considered here; and - the environmental and economic assessment of these options at the sectoral and national levels to determine their potential for improvement with respect to conventional practices.  Although the study is situated in the UK, the energy and resource recovery options considered are generic enough to be applicable to other countries and regions. 1.3  Literature review This section provides an overview of the food industry’s global energy consumption, followed by the specific energy demand of the UK’s food and drink sector, as this is Chapter 1 25  the geographical location selected in this study. The available opportunities for improving the energy efficiency across the life cycle of food and drink products reported in the literature and energy management hierarchy are presented next. Lastly, a literature overview related to the energy saving and recovery technologies is presented.  1.3.1. Global energy consumption in the food and drink industry Food is one of the basic human needs as it provides essential nutrients and energy to support human life. It is predicted that the world’s population could increase from 7.6 billion in 2017 to 9.77 billion people in 2050 [16]. Therefore, larger amounts of food will need to be produced to meet the needs of the growing world population. Better life conditions, i.e. improvement of living standards and income, will lead to a larger consumption per capita of several kinds of foods such as dairy products, vegetable oils, and processed food. Nevertheless, developed countries are currently responsible for the consumption of larger amounts of food, especially meat and dairy products, compared with developing countries [17,18].  Food cultivation and manufacturing requires the input of various resources including heat from natural gas and other sources, and electricity from the grid [19]. According to Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), food supply chain accounts for around 95 EJ/year or 30% of the world’s total energy consumption [1] and also responsible for 10 giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent as shown in Figure 1-1. The farm activities: cropping production, livestock production and fisheries production, responsible for around one fifth of the total energy consumption in the food and drink sector, but produces two thirds of the GHG. In particular, the energy consumption in high Gross domestic product (GDP) countries and low GDP countries is different. It can be seen that high-GDP countries use greater energy for processing and transportation (about 24 EJ/year), whereas in low-GDP countries, retail, preparation and cooking have the highest share (about 19.8 EJ/year) [1,20,21]. Therefore, this growth will have a significant impact on energy consumption across the food supply chain.   Chapter 1 26   Figure 1-1 Energy consumption and GHG emissions contributions across the food supply chain in the food sector [1]. 1.3.2. Energy consumption in the food and drink sector in the UK Energy consumption in the food and drink sector is related to food production and consumption including the agricultural stage, where raw materials are grown, the manufacturing of food, where food and drink products are processed and produced using industrial equipment such as pasteurizers, mixers, mills, roasters, etc., the packaging stage where the food is kept in the protective environment prior to being cooked and consumed, the transportation of food across the different supply chains including factories, merchants and consumers, and waste management, where food waste or packaging waste are treated. In the UK, the entire food supply chain is responsible for around 18% of the overall UK energy use [13].  The UK’s overall energy consumption by industrial sectors is illustrated in Figure 1-2, and accounted for 24,071 ktoil equivalents in 2017, of which 12% or 2783 ktoil equivalents corresponds to the food, drink and tobacco industries. The energy used in food and drink manufacturing is shown in Figure 1-3. As can be seen, low temperature processes, e.g. processes carried out at 80 and 140°C, are responsible for 61% of the total energy consumption in the food and drink industrial sector. Examples of these processes include pasteurisation, drying, etc. The large majority (61%) of the consumed energy is sourced from natural gas followed by grid electricity with a contribution of 30%. Oil and solid fuels are only responsible for 8% and 1%, respectively. The industrial energy consumption of different food and drink products and categories is shown in Table 1-1. Manufacture of bread together with fresh pastry goods and cakes are top of the list with 296 ktoil equivalents, followed by dairy and cheese making processes (293 ktoil equivalents), production of meat and poultry Chapter 1 27  products (262 ktoil equivalents), and beer and distilled potable alcoholic beverages (244 and 202 ktoil equivalents, respectively). The manufacture of ice cream (18 ktoil equivalents), fruit and vegetable juices (10 ktoil equivalents), and cider (4 ktoil equivalents) are at the bottom of the list [19]. In 2007, the University of Warwick [22] published a report about direct energy use in agricultural practices. The results, as shown in Figure 1-4, reveal that around 37% of direct energy use in agriculture is for heating (7497 GWh including combined heat and power or CHP), 36% for field operation (7231 GWh), 14% for ventilation (2783 GWh), 6% for refrigeration (1148 GWh), 4% for lighting (888 GWh), and 4% for motive power (834 GWh). Heating in agriculture, which excludes CHP, is used to protect crops and incubation of chicken eggs. The energy used for field operation and bed cultivation was mainly used in the arable sector (operation of tractor or machines using gas oil/diesel). The main consumers of energy for ventilation were cereals and poultry (to control the temperature and humidity). For refrigeration and cooling, dairies were responsible for more than half of the energy used in this group. Lighting was used in most areas of agriculture, especially for the livestock sector (egg laying, raising of piglets, etc.). Motive power was primarily related to transport applications such as conveying, elevating and pumping.   Figure 1-2 Industrial final energy consumption by main industrial group in 2017 [19].

Opportunities for improving energy efficiency across the supply chain in the food and drink sector Every single joule consumed has an economic and environmental cost. Therefore, reducing energy consumption saves money and reduces pollutant emissions [23].  In 2014, Tassou et al. [13] proposed approaches and technologies to improve energy efficiency along the food chain in the UK which mainly consisted of optimization of   1 This includes all industrial salt applications. Chapter 1 30  processes, implementation of higher energy efficiency equipment, and recovery of energy from waste or food waste. For instance, in the case of agriculture, though this sector is not a high energy consumer compared to the whole food chain, there is the potential to save up to about 20% of
