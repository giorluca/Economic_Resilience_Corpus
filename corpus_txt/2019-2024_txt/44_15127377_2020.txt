Introduction The need to be resilient has gained considerable influence in public policymaking and has become an “organizing principle of government action” in cities around the world (Coafee, 2013: 242). In May 2016, Cape Town was selected to join the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), which is a global network of cities who are committed to resilience in the urban context (Cape Town Preliminary Resilience Assessment (CT PRA), 2018f). 100RC defines resilience as “the capacity of individuals, communities, institutions, businesses and systems within a city to survive, adapt and grow no matter what kind of chronic stresses and acute shocks they experience.” (CCT, 2018f: 4).  The gaining prominence of resilience in urban policy has meant that urban decision makers are increasingly being asked to exhibit foresight and preparedness in how the urban system is planned and managed. The City of Cape Town has accepted this principle of resilience as a key means of driving collective understanding and action within the urban system in a time of growing uncertainty. The discussion of resilience in the context of the City of Cape Town, often involves the examining of resource flows to seek out ways to ensure the resources that the city relies on and the infrastructure necessary to deliver it to households and businesses are safeguarded from shocks. A resilient city is one that is “strong and flexible rather than brittle and fragile…. Their lifeline systems of roads, utilities and other support facilities are designed to continue functioning in the face of rising water, high winds, shaking ground and terrorist attacks” (Godschalk, 2003: 137 in Coafee, 2013: 243).   However, there is another crucial resource whose flow yields considerable influence over urban decision makers and which gains comparatively little consideration in discussions around urban resilience. This resource is money. The ability of the state to source funds is critical to its continued functioning and therefore resilience. This lapse is reflected within the City of Cape Town, where the municipal finance system is rarely considered as an important component in building urban resilience.  This thesis will show that this resource flow needs to be recognised as central to any transitions in the urban system as greater resilience is sought.  Cape Town recently experienced the worst natural disaster in the history of its city-dom, in the form of a three-year drought. The impact of this drought on the municipal budget has been formidable. In terms of expenditure, considerable adjustments to the planned expenditure had to be made in January 2018 in order to source the funds required for large-scale infrastructure 5  projects designed to increase resilience within the municipal water supply. In terms of revenue, there is significant concern around the fiscal sustainability of the municipality as more and more households are developing their own water supply in the form of rainwater tanks and boreholes, which is anticipated to decrease the municipal revenue gained from water tariffs dramatically (CCT, 2018f).  According to the City’s Preliminary Resilience Assessment (CT PRA), the drought “has shone a spotlight on the sensitivity of the existing revenue model for the City during shock events” (pg. 24). The CT PRA identifies a tension between the resilience- building activities taking place within households and businesses in response to a resource-constrained environment, and the consequent impact on the municipal budget and the associated resilience-building activities of the municipal government (CCT, 2018f: 55).  This thesis will seek to unpack this tension within the context of the 2015-2018 Cape Town drought event, with the aim of exploring how the City’s understanding of resilience was applied as the municipality grappled with how the rules and assumptions underpinning how they fund their functions impacted on their ability to respond to this shock event. The research will describe the shifts evident in the City of Cape Town’s (CCT) budgeting process during the drought event and the intersection between the City’s understanding of resilience and decision-making around its municipal financing model.  1.1 Research Question: What can the case study of the Cape Town drought event reveal with regards to how the City understands and applies the concept of resilience to its financing model in response to a shock event?  Research Objectives: a) To explore how the term resilience was used to support decision making as the City sought to respond to the drought b) To examine the activities undertaken by actors, public and private, in response to the recent Cape Town drought event, focussing on the resulting and unintended consequences on the municipal budget c) To provide insights regarding the application of the City’s understanding of resilience to the municipal financing model for Cape Town  6    7   2 Literature Review 2.1 Introduction With the effects of climate change growing, urban centers are facing more uncertainty than ever with the pressure from natural and man-made challenges mounting. It is in this context that resilience as a concept has taken hold, as cities are required to adapt and thrive in the face of more frequent and diverse threats. Urban resilience is defined as, “the network of structures, processes, infrastructure and community identity that both manages extreme stress and evolves into a more desirable state following a disturbance” (Norris et al., 2007 in Cretney, 2014: 628). This literature review will provide an account of the growing resilience literature relating to cities, which has grown alongside the development of assessment tools to measure urban resilience. It will also present a deeper dive into bodies of literature relating to recurring themes of resilience building in an urban context, highlighting the debates and tensions evident therein.  When considering what greater urban resilience looks like, it is useful to consider what it would take for the urban system to change. The flows of people, money and resources are all important in ensuring the urban system continues to function. The frequency, intensity and severity of natural hazards is growing (Djalante et al., 2011), and the costs associated with responding to and adapting in the face of these hazards is a growing burden for urban centers to bear (Djalante et al., 2013). The flow of money and decision making around financial resources, however, is rarely considered within literature relating to urban resilience. Outside of resilience literature, there is a growing interest in the financing options for changing urban contexts due to climate change, with prevalence given to the financing of the capital investments required for infrastructure transitions.  There is an established literature around municipal financing models and how they came into being which will be described in the literature review, specifically looking at the municipal finance model in place in South Africa. Municipal finance models are a key driver of how urban governments invest in, maintain and preserve the services necessary for the functioning of the urban system. However, there is little literature interrogating how the municipal finance model responds in a time of increased climate shocks and stresses.   This thesis sits at the intersection of the municipal finance and urban resilience bodies of literature and uses the Cape Town drought case study as a means of highlighting how the 8  response of the municipal finance model in a time of shock is a key determinant of the response and ongoing functioning of the urban system.   2.2 Review of Resilience in Urban planning and management discourse Resilience as a concept originated in the applied sciences where it describes the “stability of materials and their resistance to external shocks” (Spaans and Waterhout, 2016: 109). Resilience then became established within ecological systems thinking in the 1960s, where it describes, “the magnitude of the disturbance that can be absorbed before the system changes its structure” (Holling, 1996:33 in Spaans and Waterhout, 2016). Since the 1990s, the concept of resilience has increasingly gained traction in urban planning and policymaking discourse (UNHabitat, 2017). The concept of resilience gained further traction within Disaster Risk Response literature after the adoption of the Hyogo Framework for Actions 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (UNISDR 2007, in Djalante et al., 2013). In the context of disasters, resilience is understood as the “ability of a community or society to resist, absorb, accommodate and recover from disasters timely and efficiently” (UNISDR 2009 in Djalante et al., 2013: 2110).  There has been a rapid adoption of the concept among international donors. In 2013, the Rockefeller Foundation established the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) Programme with the aim of assisting cities to become more resilient to physical, social and economic challenges they face in the 21st Century (Spaans and Waterhout, 2016). In 2017, Cape Town was included as part of the 100RC network. The definition of urban resilience adopted by the Rockefeller Foundation for the 100 Resilient Cities Programme is the “ongoing capacity of cities to absorb, adapt, transform and prepare for shocks and stresses along the economic, social, institutional and environmental dimensions, with the aim of maintaining the functions of a city and improving response to future shocks.” (Figueiredo, Honiden and Schumann, 2018, pg. 10).  Within urban resilience literature there is a focus on governance and policy frameworks that guide decision makers in fostering urban resilience (UNHabitat, 2017: 7). In support of this research, there is an increasing drive towards developing resilience frameworks and associated “quantitative tools, indicators and international standards to measure resilience at the urban scale” (UNHabitat, 2017:7). Schipper and Langston (2015) have provided a comparative study on the various resilience frameworks developed, including their conceptual entry points and approach to measurement. They have found there are two schools of thought following the conceptual roots described above which inform these frameworks. One school focuses on the socio-ecological approach to resilience, which has its roots in ecological systems thinking, whereas the other school focuses on a disaster-risk focused approach to resilience (Schipper and 9  Langston, 2015). The most rigorous frameworks are able to navigate both of these two conceptual entry points, as measuring the improved livelihoods and well-being of a population will certainly provide an indication of how successful resilience building is likely to be, however it does not assist in assessing the extent to which a population is resilient to a disaster event (Schipper and Langston, 2015). In a study on Understanding and Measuring City Resilience, ARUP, in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation (2014), found that there is a large degree of convergence within the various resilience frameworks around the key dimensions of resilience building and these have been captured in the City Resilience Framework, which focuses on the capacity of the urban system to cope with a range of dynamic shocks and stresses. Coming out of this Resilience Framework is a City Resilience Index (CRI), which is quickly becoming the foremost tool in articulating “urban resilience in measurable evidence-based and accessible way that can inform urban planning, practice, and investment patterns” (The Rockefeller Foundation and ARUP, 2014: 11). This is the tool adopted by the 100 Resilient Cities network, which Cape Town is a member.  The purpose of the CRI is to offer cities a tool to measure their key strengths and weaknesses and monitor their resilience over time with the intention that the wide range of stakeholders within the urban system are able to enhance their cities resilience through their collective day-to-day practices, behaviors and decisions (The Rockefeller Foundation and ARUP, 2016). However, resilience is by nature realized through disruption of existing equilibriums, which means that in becoming more resilient, a city may be required to shed its more poorly adapted systems in favour of more resilient ones (Spaans and Waterhout, 2017). The frameworks developed to guide cities toward resilience have been criticized for not offering enough guidance on how to navigate the disruption to existing urban systems that comes with resilience-building and the vested interests inherent in these systems, whilst still safeguarding the continued functioning of the city. Sharifi and Yamagata (2016) examine the body of literature relating to urban energy resilience with the aim of developing a conceptual framework for assessing energy resilience in urban centres. This study found that often resilience literature takes the form of single-hazard studies focussing on, “hazard mitigation, ecology, transportation, infrastructure, economy, poverty, disease and pandemics, governance and agriculture” (pg. 1655). These authors have noted that a more recent and emerging conceptualization of resilience – termed ‘adaptive resilience’ recognises that the dynamic and complex nature of cities means that they continuously undergo 10  change in response to shocks and stresses, and do not necessarily return to an equilibrium state. These systems exhibit adaptive resilience through their ability to engage in “short term coping” and “long term adaptation” (pg. 1660). In short, these systems are able to “bounce back and also bounce forward.” (pg. 1660). There is growing recognition that resilience is both a process and an outcome that takes cities beyond merely being prepared for and able to recover from specific disaster events as is the focus of disaster risk reduction efforts (Spaans and Waterhout, 2016). Rather, urban resilience assumes that at any one time a city faces a multitude of stresses and shocks and the urban system as a whole must be able to cope with a wide range of disruptive events.  A number of tensions and debates around how the changes required for cities to achieve greater resilience practically play out within the four dimensions above have emerged within the literature and these will be discussed further below. 2.2.1 Resilience by Whom and for Whom? The dominance of governments as the audience for resilience literature is of concern to some, including Cote and Nightingale (2012), Coafee (2013), Cretney (2014) and Kolers (2016) and as this perhaps over-emphasises the role of the state as the custodian of city resilience.  There is recognition that the governance culture of a city will influence how City Resilience Frameworks are applied and at what scale resilience-building activities take place and who is responsible for undertaking these activities (Spaans and Waterhout, 2017). ARUP have found that there are many cases where there is dominance by the state in engaging with shocks and stresses facing cities and where the state is viewed as the main actor in building urban resilience.  Stemming from the understanding that cities function as “complex, interdependent and integrated social-ecological systems” (UNHabitat, 2017: 6), there is recognition that building resilience in an urban context requires an integrated, multi-level and multi-stakeholder approach. OECD produced a paper outlining ‘Indicators for Resilient Cities’ that provides guidance to city governments on how to develop a local resilience strategy and what indicators are useful in measuring urban resilience. This paper asks the important questions of “Are disasters perceived differently by different stakeholders?” (Figueiredo et. al., 2018: 5). Coafee (2013) argues that the resilience lens is unique in its enhanced appreciation of the range of perspectives, objectives and contexts within the urban system which need to be taken into account when building resilience, in contrast to “traditional approaches to urban risk and security [which] relied upon a narrow range of governmental stakeholders” (pg. 243). Resilience discourse has facilitated the involvement of more stakeholders, as well as a shift in the scale of 11  intervention being invoked (Chandler, 2012 in Coafee, 2013: 248). Coafee (2013) has argued that resilience has “disrupted the traditional relationship between the state and the individual with ‘governing from a distance’ through decentralized decision-making and authority increasingly encouraged” (Coafee, 2013: 243).  Through a review of resilience literature and an evaluation of how the concept has evolved over time Cretney (2014) depicts how the term resilience is used by different actors for different purposes. This paper asks questions around ‘for whom’ and ‘by whom’ resilience is enacted. Cretney (2014) argues that resilience literature, both in the academic and in the popular use of the concept, has not grappled with the elements of power, agency and inequality which are at play within an urban system. Pike et. al. (2010) highlights how due to the state’s wide-reaching power it is able to shape how resilience is understood and measured, viewing the need for strong institutions and state resources as key in building resilience (in Cretney, 2014). This questions whether resilience tools and frameworks can be used to reinforce dominant power relations. This concern is highlighted by Welsh (2014) who argues that “exploitative systems can be extremely resilient, favouring certain social groups at the expense of others, implying that resilience is not always a desired state” (in Durban Resilience Strategy (DRS), 2017: 15). There are a number of researchers whom have questioned whether the actions justified in the name of resilience result in, “further marginalisation of disadvantaged populations, threaten democratic processes ….” (Coafee and Rogers, 2008; Walker and Cooper, 2011; Cretney, 2014). The popular application of resilience often calls for more responsibility for coping with shocks and stresses to be placed on the individual or community level rather than on the state.  Similarly, Cote and Nightingale (2012) argue that “resilience thinking is a power-laden framing that creates certain windows of visibility on the processes of change, while obscuring others” (pg. 484). Within an urban system, there are competing power, authority and complex rationalities at play, therefore it is important that resilience literature become more critically engaged in questions around whose environments, livelihoods and interests are being protected through resilience activities. Furthermore, Cote and Nightingale (2012) highlight how competing value systems and systems of power are integral to the development of resilient socio-ecological systems (SES). This paper highlights how conflicts in scientific and indigenous knowledge can have considerable bearing on how the concept of resilience is interpreted and effected by different actors, however this conflict has not been engaged with in resilience literature (Cote and Nightingale, 2012). Conflicts around resilience occur not only between interest groups, but also between different systems. It is possible for a system to be environmentally resilient but not socially desirable, and vice versa (Walker and Salt (2012) in Cretney, 2014). 12  It is evident that resilience is intrinsically conflictual (Kolers, 2016; Harris, Chu and Ziervogel, 2017). Therefore, there is a need for explicit recognition within resilience literature that achieving greater urban resilience does not just require involving more stakeholders but also the recognition and negotiation between the different agendas held by stakeholders (Harris et al., 2017). What happens when the resilience of individuals conflicts with that of the state?  The Durban Resilience Strategy (2017) argues that urban resilience cannot be considered separate from ‘politics’, given that politics is “the process through which people construct, defend and change the rules and frameworks which inform how they live” (Miller, 1980 in DRS, 2017: 15). True resilience building requires actors to critically engage and negotiate, “the material changes, processes and pathways that lead to more sustainable societies” (DRS, 2017: 15). Resilience therefore needs to be considered in terms of “who benefits, by whom and for what reasons or purposes” (DRS, 2017: 15). Interestingly, this perspective on resilience saw Durban parting ways with the 100 Resilient Cities network (DRS, 2017). There is a need to consider in the context of a particular city; to what extent the activities associated with resilience building can be effectively undertaken by a range of actors, including non-governmental organisations as well as individual households and businesses (Spaans and Waterhout, 2017). The Cape Town drought event offers an opportunity to interrogate how the concept of resilience is interpreted and negotiated between different actors during a shock event, and how these differing and at times conflicting interpretations can impact on the financial model underpinning service delivery.  2.2.2 Cape Town Preliminary Resilience Assessment: Over the first half of 2018, the City of Cape Town undertook the City Resilience Assessment using the Rockefeller City Resilience Index (CRI) as part of the 100 resilient cities programme and is in the process of developing a Resilience Strategy. The purpose of this index is to help cities “understand and measure their capacity to endure, adapt and transform” (The Rockefeller Foundation and ARUP, 2016). As part of this programme, a mass survey involving over 11 000 participants was undertaken where persons were asked to identify the most pertinent chronic stresses and Acute shocks facing Cape Town. A Chronic Stress is defined as a phenomenon, which weakens, “the fabric of a city on a day-to-day or cyclical basis, for example, high unemployment and crime.” (CCT, 2018f: 5). An Acute shock is a “sudden sharp event that threaten a city, for example, earthquakes and floods” (CT PRA, 2018f: 5).  It is important to note that the City Resilience Framework does not outline a roadmap for how cities are to become more resilient. Instead its aim is to provide a set of critical domains for 13  resilience, which allow cities to assess, “the extent to which critical functions are capable of adapting to new situations induced by shock or stress” (Spaans and Waterhout, 2017:115).  This Index is based on research conducted by The Rockefeller Foundation and ARUP (2016) and outlines four dimensions critical for resilience, which include:  “People [Health and Wellbeing]: the health and well-being of everyone living and working in the city;  Organization [Economy and Society]: the social and economic systems that enable urban populations to live peacefully, and act collectively  Place [Infrastructure and Environment]: the quality of infrastructure and ecosystems that protects, provide and connect us;  Knowledge [Leadership and Strategy]: the capacity to learn from the past and take appropriate action based on evidence and active participation, including business and civil society” (The Rockefeller Foundation and ARUP, 2016: 10). Figure 1 below depicts how these dimensions are unpacked into 12 drivers, all of which focus on an aspect of resilience building in the urban context.  The Index also provides seven qualities of resilient systems (ARUP, 2014: 5): - Reflective: the ability to continuously evolve and modify according to emerging evidence - Resourceful: the ability to, “rapidly find different ways to achieve their goals or meet their needs during a shock or when under stress” - Robust: the ability to anticipate and design for potential failures in systems - Inclusive: the ability to consult and engage with a broad range of stakeholders - Redundant: the ability to withstand disruptions and extreme pressure due to built-in spare capacity - Integrated: the ability to ensure alignment between city systems and decisions towards a common outcome - Flexible: the ability to “change, evolve and adapt in response to changing circumstances’”.  14  Figure 1: City Resilience Framework   Source: City Resilience Framework (ARUP, 2014:9)  Four enablers for Resilience have been identified within the Cape Town Preliminary Resilience Assessment, two of which are relevant for this thesis (CCT, 2018f). One of these enablers and an associated pathfinding question for each are listed below. It is intended that this research will provide reflections on this pathfinding question, drawing lessons from the drought event.  An enabler identified through the PRA is the improvement of resourcing and funding resilience, with the following associated pathfinding question: (CCT, 2018f: pg. 55) “How does the City develop a resilient long-term financial strategy? How do we use our data to understand future financing needs based on what we extrapolate for the ‘resilience’ gates in our strategic business processes and how do we construct a financial strategy accordingly? 15  The CT PRA notes the need for Cape Town city government to be reflective and self-aware in order to continuously incorporate the learnings from past experiences in improving strategies and plans to avoid future shocks (CCT, 2018f). Furthermore, the PRA calls for “improved accountability and decision-making around instances of shock” (pg. 53). Thus, documenting and critically reviewing how the municipal budget was able to respond to the Cape Town drought event is an important step in giving effect to the desired embedding of the concept of resilience into decision making relating to the municipal budget.  The following section will briefly outline the regulatory and literature environment determining the structure and processes associated with municipal finance in South Africa. This section also provides a critique of how the current municipal financing model is able to adapt to the changing nature of cities, which includes new and evolving stresses and shocks.  2.3 Understanding Municipal Finance in the South African context UNHabitat (2015) recognises that municipal finances are under pressure globally, due to the “widening gap between the availability of financial resources and municipal spending needs”. One of the driving forces behind this gap is the rapidly growing urban populations and the resultant growth in demand for public services, new public infrastructure and the increasing maintenance burden (UNHabitat, 2015).  In South Africa, the powers and functions of local government are entrenched in its constitution, making it one of the most advanced local government systems in the world (Cameron, 2001). The South African White Paper on Local Government (1998) initiated the policy and legal framework for municipalities as a third tier of government. Between 1998 and 2004 the mandates and focus of local governments were deepened and a classification system was put in place which led to the creation of metropolitan cities, giving them enhanced powers and responsibilities and autonomy. Municipalities fund basic services including water, electricity, refuse removal, fire-fighting and emergency services, selected social services and amenities, as well as a host of urban management services (National Treasury, 2017). These services require both capital expenditure and operating expenditure in order to ensure their continued functioning and the efficiency and effectiveness thereof. Capital Expenditure involves the utilisation of funds to replace, improve or expand infrastructure necessary for these services to be delivered. Operating Expenditure refers to the funds required for the ongoing costs of keeping the services operational, including the remuneration of staff, repairs and maintenance (SACN, 2015). 16  A City governments ability to function relies on its ability to collect revenue and administer expenditure on both day-to-day operations which ensure the continued functioning of current infrastructure and capital projects which see new services created and infrastructures expanded to accommodate a growing city (SACN, 2015). The fiscal instruments that are available to municipalities to fund their expenditure responsibilities include, “own revenue (property taxes, user charges for municipal services rendered, surcharges on user charges and other local taxes), intergovernmental transfers (conditional and unconditional grants) from national government and municipal borrowing from credit markets (financial institutions) for capital expenditure” (SACN, 2017: 25). Revenue from Electricity sales are the main source of revenue for South African municipalities, accounting for approximates 50% of all city own revenue (SACN, 2014). This is followed by Property rates contributing roughly 20% and thirdly revenue from water sales contributing approximately 15% (SACN, 2014).  To ensure that municipal finances are managed lawfully, the municipal financing system is regulated by the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) (Mtwesi, 2016). The Local Government Fiscal Framework is based on the recognition that certain municipalities have less own revenue raising potential than others (National Treasury, 2017). In 2017, Metropolitan cities were allocated only 4.29% of the total national tax base, the assumption being that cities have the potential to raise considerably more revenue than other government institutions and are expected to be largely self-financing (SACN, 2017). However, in 2001 it was already apparent that the infrastructure backlogs facing municipalities meant that their ability to fund their needs using own revenue is not sufficient (Cameron, 2001). The model underpinning city financing is circular in nature, whereby the revenue generating potential depends on the expenditures made. It is anticipated that the expenditure of municipalities will lead to improvements in the Quality of Life of city residents, thereby enhancing their ability to prosper and consequently their ability to better afford to pay for municipal services and to pay more tax (SACN, 2016). The effect being that the ‘own’ revenue potential for municipalities will increase as households and businesses are able to pay property taxes and service charges (SACN, 2016: 46).  The South African Cities Network conducted a study in 2017 investigating alternative financing models for metropolitan cities, in partnership with Tswane Municipality (SACN, 2017). This study took into account the impacts of shock-risks and normal risks on municipal financing and proposed some crosscutting principles and fiscal instruments which could provide for a better fiscal environment for municipalities.   17  This report outlines the three major risks facing cities and their ability to finance their functions: - “Climate change and its effects on resourcing, space, habitat, administrative management, infrastructure and planning - Political and governance regime change or regional / national wars - Economic crises (specific) and its effects on financing; administrative management and infrastructure” (SACN, 2017: 34). The report concludes that, “the current financing model is inadequate to meet the medium to long term trajectory of local government and cities” (SACN, 2017: 35). The Local Government Equitable Share has not increased from its flat rate of 9% despite the functions and mandates of local government increasing by 43%. The report advises that metropolitan city revenue sources need to be diversified and a number of the existing revenue sources currently allocated to other spheres of government need to be re-assigned to cities in order for them to sustainably deliver on their mandated responsibilities (SACN, 2017). One of the crucial questions raised by this report is in relation to the principle of sustainability, where it motivates that consideration be given, “to the extent to which cites are reducing the impact on the environment through their day to day operations and new or refurbed infrastructure investment” (SACN, 2017: 47). The report raises questions around whether the financing model of cities contradicts these objectives and whether alternative revenue raising opportunities associated with more environmentally sustainable growth can be developed (SACN, 2017: 47).  2.3.1 Financing the water services in times of climate uncertainty There are a number of public finance researchers who have focussed specifically on the logic underpinning the financing model underpinning the water service in different contexts and the challenges which this model is encountering due to climate uncertainty.  Muller (2017) argues, “water could become a lead sector in the process of developing appropriate models for financing the implementation of adaptation” (pg. 111). Water managers are required to make sound decisions regarding infrastructure investments in a time of uncertainty, relying on a thorough understanding of the relative operating costs and lifecycle costs of various water infrastructure options over time (Muller, 2017). The important backdrop to these decisions is climate variability if investments in water infrastructure are to successfully “perform under future climate regimes” (Muller, 2017: 105). The understanding of risk among water managers associated with climate variability will determine water managers’ appetite to 18  pursue more expensive options which deliver a more climate-independent water source. However, it is important to note that these decisions are tied to the financial model linked with these options.  Rusca and Schwartz (2018) describe how cost-recovering tariffs are held up as an important means of achieving the goal of ‘water for all’ inherent in global strategy like the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015) and the Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030). The motivation for this approach being that a water utility needs to be financially sustainable if it is to be able to perform better will be able to provide water more efficiently to its customers. Rusca and Schwartz (2018) outline the business administrative case for cost recovery which is a key informant into how water utilities within Sub-Saharan African have chosen to model their water utility function on. This case purports that by under-pricing services, the financial viability of the water utility will be undermined leading to “low operating performance and underinvestment in infrastructure (pg. 102). Full cost recovery is commonly viewed as a pre-requisite for the expansion of the network infrastructure and therefore growing the access of the poor to drinking water. This paper interrogates how inclusive urban water services can be achieved in the context of sub-Saharan Africa where extensive socio-economic inequalities exist. It finds that the adoption of full cost recovery principles by water utilities can exacerbate rather than enhance access to safe water supply.   A further argument for full cost-recovery tariffs described by Rusca and Schwartz (2018) is that by paying the full environmental and economic cost of the service, consumers are incentivised to reduce their water consumption and limit wastage and misuse. Some researchers have raised the concern that payment by citizens for water services doesn’t necessarily reflect a willingness and ability to pay due to water being essential for life (Khunou, 2002 in Rusca and Schwartz, 2018). Rather, the payment of higher tariffs for water may lead to significant implications for lower income households and inhibit their access to other goods or basic services.  Rusca and Schwartz (2018) argue that the, “financial performance of a water provider should not only be measured by the level of cost recovery, but also by its ability to access other sustainable sources of funding” (pg. 107). They have observed that the “existing institutional framework regulating water production and associated tariffs is still geared toward a single utility with a mandate to provide water access to all” (Rusca and Schwartz, 2018:107). However, these institutional frameworks are not able to adapt to the realities of the heterogeneous municipal water systems at play within cities in sub-Saharan Africa. The principles and practices relating to water pricing need to be able to respond to the multitude of ways people meet their water needs 19  within these complex urban environments, in response to their own financial resource constraints, as well as water supply constraints.  Within the Cape Town specific literature relating to resilience and municipal finance, there is an identified need for analysis and the building of insights relating to how the principles of resilience can be better reflected and applied within the municipal financing model. The final section of this literature review will highlight studies which explore areas of intersection between the municipal finance and urban resilience literature.  2.4 Intersections between Public Finance and Resilience Literature  There are a few examples within urban resilience literature and its associated indices and frameworks where the importance of applying resilience thinking to financing systems is noted. Muller et al. (2007) argue that institutional mechanisms and financial instruments, which allow for greater resilience to climate variability, are essential for the continued functioning of local governments in the face of increasing complexity and uncertainty. The OECD Ministerial Council’s statement (2014) motivates that there are four inter-related dimensions of resilience, these being the economic, environmental, social and institutional dimensions, with most disasters requiring the efforts of all four dimensions to overcome. The institutional dimension requires, “clear leadership and long-term vision; sufficient public resources; collaboration with other levels of government; and an open and participatory government” (pg. 17). Within the Risk Governance Process (OECD, 2014) it calls for governments to “plan for contingent liabilities within clear public finance frameworks by enhancing efforts to minimize the impact that critical risks may have on public finances and the fiscal position of a country in order to support greater resilience.” (Pg. 20).  Djalante et al. (2013) echo this sentiment in their seven pathways for adaptive and integrated disaster resilience. Within this framework they recognize that the provision of adequate financial resources is a crucial part of disaster resilience and as such, one of the seven pathways is ‘Finance and Risk’ whereby comprehensive disaster risk finance and insurance must be developed using a broad set of private and public instruments. They urge urban governments to seek the diversification of their financial resources if they are to adequately, “deal with complexities and to anticipate uncertain impacts from hazards and climate change” (Djalante et al., 2013: 2122).  Sharifi and Yamagata (2016) in putting together a conceptual framework for assessing urban energy resilience, they recognise the importance of governance and strong institutional capacity to monitor the functioning of the system, as well as strong decision-support environment to 20  support adaptation. This paper notes the need for urban authorities and utilities to make available the resources and funding necessary for resilience-building actions, however, the question around whether the system which governs the allocation of these resources and funds is adequate to support these activities is never asked. The flexibility, robustness etc. of the financial system will determine whether urban governors are able to perform in the manner called for in this paper, whereby urban governors “experiment with a wide array of carrot and stick measures to reduce energy consumption and encourage technology development” (pg. 1670) or indeed whether they have the incentive to do so from a financial sustainability perspective.   Brugmann’s (2011) paper on ‘Financing the resilient city’ does bring the finance lens into the resilience debate. He argues that resilience upgrading activities with regards to infrastructure should include, “a set of financially justified risk reduction measures that increase the reliability of investment returns and asset values under a wider range of circumstances” (p. 217). This paper highlights the importance of resilience upgrading efforts not solely focussing on the infrastructure design, but also the interdependent sub-systems that inform it. It calls for “a more integrated focus on overall environmental risks, development conditions and local area performance” (pg. 222). With regards to the financing of these projects, Brugmann (2011) cautions that reliance on international adaptation funds should be avoided, and rather resilience upgrading projects should leverage public and private finance. This paper unpacks the importance of financial planning and innovative financing mechanisms with regards to infrastructure upgrading projects, but does not cover the financial planning and mechanisms required to allow for the urban system as a whole to adapt to new challenges. Furthermore, it is increasingly necessary to critically review the assumptions and bias inherent in the current systems and processes at work within urban governance, specifically financial modelling.   2.5 Conclusion   Resilience is an approach adopted by the City of Cape Town, and many other city governments around the world, to ensure that the resources that the city relies on and the infrastructure that distribute these resources are safeguarded from shocks (Ziervogel et. al., 2017). The embeddedness of resources within the urban system means that transformation of that system to one which is more resilient becomes more difficult (Walker and Salt, 2012 in Cretney, 2014). However, within resilience literature, money is a resource not often considered in light of a 21  resilient urban center. Arguably, an important attribute of a resilient city government should be its ability to plan, allocate and manage funds in a way that ensures reliable and sufficient utility services.  A financially robust city is one that anticipates the shocks and stresses of the 21st century and puts in place a financial model that is able to withstand these changes. The bringing together of these two bodies of work offer useful insights which can be applied to the Cape Town context, as we use the drought event as an opportunity to observe how these two bodies of knowledge and the logics underpinning them play out during a shock event.  The Cape Town case study also presents an opportunity to observe how the concept and practice of resilience can be translated from the “natural to the social world” (Davoudi et al., 2012: 305), whereby the systems which urban governments are seeking to safeguard are increasingly able to change and adapt rather than merely ‘bounce back’ to their original state in response to a shock.  Resilience literature is also lacking in providing guidance to urban governments in navigating tensions between actors with regards to their resilience-building efforts. The role of the state is often the focus of resilience authors and there is therefore a tendency to ignore the complexity of the urban system, whereby there are multiple actors all seeking to build their resilience in the face of increasing shocks and persistent stresses. The actions undertaken by these actors in the name of resilience may conflict, compounding the effects of shocks or stresses impacting upon the city. Furthermore, consideration of the temporal and spatial interactions taking place at various scales, becomes important in understanding the trade-offs being made in pursuit of urban resilience (Chelleri, Waters, Olazabal and Minucci, 2015).  Therefore, although the concept of resilience offers a useful lens through which to assess whether a city is able to cope with a wide range of shocks and stresses, the literature base needs to develop further in its consideration of the trade-offs, interdependencies, unintended consequences and conflicting interests inherent in a complex urban system if it is going to better inform decision-making in this space. This thesis will show how these tensions are evident within the municipal finance system informing the investment, operations and tariffing decisions for the water service during the recent Cape Town drought event. It is clear from a review of literature that there is a need to explore how resilience can be understood and applied to a municipal finance model in periods of high complexity and uncertainty associated with a shock event.     22   4. Research Methodology:  The following section will outline how information was gathered in order to provide an account of the various responses to the drought and how this information was analysed to describe the implications of these activities on the municipal budget. The identification of the research question emerged through the Cape Town drought as experienced by the researcher, who is a City of Cape Town employee hired to provide strategic support to the politician tasked with providing oversight over the Disaster Risk Management department during this time (Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security).    4.1 Research Approach:  This thesis adopted a pragmatic approach, whereby the research focussed on the systematic study of a particular problem, with the intention of articulating the drivers and contextual elements leading to this problem which could then point to a solution (Creswell, 2013). This research was conducted using a mixed methods approach, whereby many approaches to the collecting and analysing of data, information and insights were adopted (Creswell, 2013). The methods used were selected in order to best achieve the research aim and objectives.  In terms of the gathering of information, a range of techniques were used in order to increase the veracity of this information, particularly in order to confirm the sequence of events and decisions taken throughout the drought event which had implications for the municipal budget (Berg, 2004). The information gathered through written records was checked against the first-hand accounts gained through interviews and the researcher’s own experience.  The research conducted a thorough evaluation and synthesis of documentation relating to the City of Cape Town’s budgeting process for both the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years as well as the planning being conducted for the 2019/20 budget cycle. The evidence reviewed included presentations to political and administrative committees and civic interest groups, Monthly Financial Monitoring Reports, annual Medium Term Revenue and Expenditure Frameworks, meeting minutes and studies. This documentation was reviewed in order to gain understanding as to the impact of the 2015-2018 drought event on the municipal budget development process 23  within the 2017/18 and 2018/19 financial years. Other forms of written evidence included in this review was media statements made by the City of Cape Town and media articles written which featured quotes from key decision makers within the City.  A Descriptive Research Methodology was utilised in order to collect information through observation, as part of the researcher’s capacity as a City of Cape Town employee, which meant they were included in many meetings and discussions relating to the drought event as it was unfolding throughout 2017 and 2018.  Evidence was reviewed relating to the meetings/ workshops listed below, including the researcher’s own personal notes, meeting minutes, documents and presentations: - City of Cape Town Workshop on the Budget Policies for 2018/19  - Built Environment Performance Plan 2019/20 planning meetings - Urban Growth Management Meetings August 2018 - Informal Settlement Engagement (organised by Slum Dwellers International) – presentation by Ethekweni municipality on the Durban Resilience Strategy - Work Session with UNHabitat, National Treasury’s City Support Programme and CCT on scenario planning around the financial sustainability of the municipality - 3rd August 2018  Interviews were conducted with key officials involved in the municipal budgeting process, from the following City of Cape Town departments: - Resilience Unit: Cayley Green (Senior Resilience Analyst – Resilience Unit) - Strategic Policy Unit: Daniel Sullivan (Acting Manager)   These interviews were in-depth, semi-structured interviews with the intention of gaining a detailed perspective of the interviewees’ experience of and opinion on the City of Cape Town’s budget development process in light of the concept of resilience. 4.2 Data Analysis:  The purpose of the research is to provide descriptive accounts based on the information captured from the various collection techniques described (Berg, 2014). This research analysis approach enables the researcher to better understand the sequence of events and trajectory which occurred during the drought event, as well as explore the areas of tension and 24  contradiction which emerged between the assumptions, functional roles and responsibilities within local government.  The researcher’s embeddedness within the City of Cape Town meant that the identification of the underlying causes and possible interventions relating to the research question could be collaboratively constructed between the researcher and practitioners, with the shared objective of improving the practice and service delivery of the practitioner (Berg, 2004). The researcher was able to work with practitioners to reflect on the underlying assumptions impacting on the decisions taken during the shock event and challenge these assumptions in light of the City’s understanding of resilience (Berg, 2004). Due to the embedded nature of the researcher, it is likely that a researcher bias influenced the research question and methodological approach (Diefenbach, 2008). The researcher is an employee of the City of Cape Town and was involved in many meetings and discussions where various aspects of the municipal response to the drought event were discussed. This provides for uniquely detailed insights into the complexity of the decision-making process for City authorities, but also means that the research question emerged from the researcher’s experience of this time in local government.  However, the researcher has been cautious not to stray from the descriptive mode of analysis, using the Cape Town Drought event to highlight tensions and raise questions around the City’s understanding of the principles of resilience and the extent to which the municipal financing model exhibits these principles during a shock event. The intention of this research is not to provide case study findings which can be generalized and applied to other city experiences.  4.3 Conceptual Framework  The Cape Town drought event coincided with the City’s growing interest in resilience as a unifying principle which could drive collective understanding and action. As a result, resilience became the dominant discourse of the City during the drought, particularly as a means of articulating the City’s understanding of, and response to growing uncertainty brought about by climate change. It was also used as a concept which all facets of local government and society at large were called upon to unite behind, with resilience being expressed by the municipality as a shared objective for all residents of Cape Town.  25  This thesis will explore the City’s framing of resilience together with its underlying principles and make observations around how this framing of resilience is evident in how the drought event was responded to within the municipal budgeting process. The drought disrupted the status quo on both the expenditure and revenue side of the municipal budget for the water service. The expenditure budget for water services over the period of the drought, depicts how the City as the active agent responded in terms of their understanding of what a resilient water service would look like. The revenue budget for water, where service charges are linked to the amount of water consumed, depicts how the residents’ relationship with water changed during the course of the drought, and likewise their levels of water consumption. In viewing the drought through the lens of the municipal financial model and in assessing the implications of the drought on both the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget, it is possible to gain insight into the impact of activities undertaken by multiple actors in the pursuit of ‘water resilience’ on the finance resource base for the water service.  The story of how the municipal budget system was affected by and reacted to the drought provides an opportunity to observe how useful the City’s understanding of resilience is when applied to a complex system, where many actors undertake simultaneous and independent activities, and the impact of these activities is evident at multiple levels and across multiple systems and sub-systems. The researcher wanted to test whether the City’s understanding of resilience was reflected in how it navigated the tensions and uncertainty brought about by the drought and whether it was useful in re-assessing the assumptions underpinning the water service financing model.    26    5. The Cape Town Drought Case Study   5.1 Introduction This section will begin with a brief description of the Cape Town municipal budget and some of the recent concerns around the sustainability of the municipality’s major revenue streams. This provides the backdrop for the Cape Town drought case study. This thesis provides a descriptive analysis of this shock event both in terms of the response it invoked from municipal government and from Cape Town’s businesses and households. An account is provided around how the contradictions and tensions evident in how the responses from these various actors impacted upon the municipality’s finances, and what this case study reveals around the assumptions inherent in the municipal finance model. The discussion ends with a collection of reflections around the application of CCT’s understanding of resilience to its municipal budgeting approach in a time of greater uncertainty.  5.2 Cape Town Budget Context: For the current financial year, 2018/19, the total municipal budget is R47.7 billion with R8.4 billion for capital expenditure and R39.3 billion for operating expenditure (CCT, 2018b). Figure 2 below indicates that the majority of the City’s operating budget is allocated to the Energy Directorate, followed closely by the Informal Settlements, Water and Waste directorate in order to provide the basic services of water and waste collection. The third largest tranche is provided to the Transport and Urban Development Authority with the aim of developing and maintaining an integrated public transport system (CCT, 2018b).         27  Figure 2: Total Operating expenditure for each City directorate for 2017/2018 (CCT. 2018b)    Source:  CCT, 2018b  The City funds the vast majority of its operating budget from revenue derived from the charges levied for services (48.7%) including electricity, water, refuse and sanitation tariffs, with the second largest revenue stream being property rates (23.8%) (CCT, 2018b). The City also gains an equitable share grant from National Government for the purposes of subsidising the provision of free basic water, electricity, sanitation and refuse removal services for the poor. Figure 3 outlines the major revenue streams received by the City of Cape Town and the amount of funds predicted from each category for the 2018/19 financial year (CCT, 2018b). Electricity charges bring in by far the most revenue for the municipality at almost R12.6billion per annum, which accounts for 32% of the City’s total revenue. This is followed by property rates (R9.3billion) which 28  accounts for 23.8% of total revenue. Water service charges are the third largest source of ‘own’ revenue for the municipality at R3.5billion per annum, and together with revenue from sanitation charges (R1.8billion), water service related revenue contributes 13.7% of total revenue.  Both the water and electricity utilities and their associated tariff models have been built on a cost-recovery basis, whereby the costs of providing these services is expected to be recouped via service charges, with a degree of cross-subsidisation built in to accommodate the provision of free or subsidised services to the ‘indigent’ population. It is clear that the willingness and ability of households and businesses to pay property tax and utility charges is a very important factor in ensuring that the Cape Town municipality is able to generate the revenue it needs to meet its commitments. The revenue generation model is also premised on the consumption of services by households and businesses, as the revenue gained from electricity and water services are linked to the consumption of these services rather than availability thereof. A household or business pays according to the amount of water or electricity they have consumed in the past month. This is a second important factor which underpins this revenue model and is built upon assumptions that the demand for these services would remain constant or at least be predictable over time.   Figure 3: Major Revenue categories of the 2018/19 budget Revenue By Source Expected Revenue for 2018/19 Financial Year (R Thousand) Percentage of Total Revenue Property Rates 9, 361, 952 23.8% Service Charges – Electricity Revenue  12, 591, 403 32% Service Charges – Water Revenue 3, 574, 755 9.1% Service Charges – Sanitation Revenue  1, 811, 048 4.6% Service Charges – Refuse Removal  1, 202, 059 3.1% Fines, penalties and forfeits 1, 280, 160 3.3% Transfers and Subsidies  6, 803, 608 17.3% Total Revenue (excluding capital transfers and contributions) 39, 349, 818 100.0% Source: Adapted from CCT, 2018b 29   5.2.1 Revenue Sustainability Questions – Electricity, Water and Sanitation Consumption Trends  The City of Cape Town’s financial model is referred to as the Medium-Term Revenue and Expenditure Framework (MTREF). The intention of this model is to determine “the appropriate mix of financial parameters and assumptions within which the City should operate to facilitate budgets that are affordable and sustainable at least ten years into the future” (CCT, 2018r:1). In reviewing the MTREF’s for the past four years, it is evident that shifts are occurring in both the electricity and water sectors, with regards to how much of these services are being consumed by residents, and consequently how much revenue the City can raise from the sale of these services (CCT 2014-2018). These transitions are due in large part to extreme landscape pressures come in the form of load shedding in the electricity sector and severe water restrictions linked to the recent drought.    In the case of electricity, limitations have been reached in manufactured capital/infrastructure, where power generation plant capacity was rendered insufficient to meet demand due to a lack of asset management by Eskom. As a result, many households and businesses have invested in embedded electricity generating technologies, mainly in the form of Solar PV Panels, in order to secure their supply of electricity during these times. This trend, together with increasing energy efficiencies, has meant that residents are buying less of their electricity from the state, resulting in a persistent decline in revenue being realised from electricity sales by the City of Cape Town (CCT, 2018f). The Medium Term Revenue and Expenditure Framework (MTREF) depict a persistent 1% or 1.5% decline in the consumption of electricity over the past four years up until the 2017/18 MTREF (CCT, 2018s). The current MTREF depicts the rate of shrinkage in electricity consumption doubling to 2.68% for the 2018/19 financial year, and a predicted shrinkage of 2% for the following two financial years (CCT, 2018s). This persistent decline in electricity consumption is a trend that the CCT has recognised and incorpo
