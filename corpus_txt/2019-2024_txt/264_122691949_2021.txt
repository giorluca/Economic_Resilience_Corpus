This intensification will ultimately lead to increased destruction over contemporary losses for coastal U.S. military installations unless infrastructure resiliency and adaptation measures are implemented.  To develop actionable adaptation measures, risk analyses of climate-intensified hurricanes can be downscaled to the infrastructure-level, to determine what systems need to be made resilient to future intensities, and at what time horizon adaptation is necessary to mitigate losses. This research examines this through simulation of probabilistic, climate-intensified hurricane events occurring throughout the 21st century at Eglin Air Force Base. Coupling Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) Hazus hurricane and flood models with climate projections for wind intensity, tidal conditions, and sea-level rise produces an end of century assessment of losses to the installation.  Coarse spatial damages emanating from Hazus’s wind and storm surge intensity outputs are downscaled to the facility level so that timely climate adaptation triggers can be identified. The facility losses and climate signals are used as inputs for a dynamic adaptation pathway model. The pathway model is used to calculate the expected benefits, risks, and costs associated with adaptation by utilizing various infrastructure investment strategies. This work is the first of its kind to downscale multi-hazard threats from a single extreme weather event to the facility-level and produce actionable facility adaptation recommendations for military installations. Such pathways can be used by planners and engineers to inform campus and installation development and sustainment v plans. Development of adaptation pathways with climate uncertainty considerations is vital to reducing coastal bases’ vulnerability to future hurricane events.                         vi                For my son, mein ganzer Stolz vii Acknowledgments First, I would first like to thank my wife whose constant support enabled me to succeed throughout this program.

Introduction “Climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and, make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country.” - President Barack Obama, USCGA Commencement Address, 2015 Background Throughout its history, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) has monitored, analyzed, and prepared for threats that might be detrimental to national security and ensured the safeguarding of the American people. While these threat analyses have traditionally been kinetically focused, either on near-peer foreign adversaries or terrorist organizations, the United States’ greatest threat may not come from opposing militant groups, but perhaps nature itself. In recent history, extreme weather events have caused widespread destruction, financial impact, and severe loss of life in the U.S. (Smith & Katz, 2013; Smith & Matthews, 2015; NHC, 2020). The most impactful and threatening of which have been tropical cyclones (TC) (Smith & Matthews, 2015).  The DoD has positioned many of its installations in coastal areas and has not been spared from these extreme weather events, as multiple TCs have ravaged coastal installations over the last several decades. In 1992 Hurricane Andrew caused such severe destruction to Homestead Air Force Base (AFB) that it was closed as an active-duty 2   installation (Grudo, 2017). In 2005, Keesler AFB experienced storm surges of over 9.1 m (30 ft) from Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in approximately $1 billion in damages (Perry, 2006). Most recently, Tyndall AFB sustained over $3 billion in damages from Hurricane Michael in 2018, and 75% of facilities on the installation needed to be extensively repaired or demolished (Beven et al., 2019; Everstine, 2019).  While TCs have historically been, and are currently, a severe threat to DoD coastal installations, the outlook of future TC conditions is even more alarming. Major TCs, defined as storms categorized as hurricanes, are projected to intensify (Fraza & Elsner, 2014; Villarini & Vecchi, 2013), increase in occurrence frequency (Bacmeister et al., 2016), and undergo rapid intensification before landfall (Emanuel, 2017). These future conditions are expected to be caused by climate change and rising global temperatures (Contento et al., 2019). As a result, future hurricane occurrences are projected to have substantially greater impact on coastal areas, and result in significantly greater damages relative to contemporary events (Elsner et al., 2011; Pilkington & Mahmoud, 2016).  Since 2010 the DoD has identified climate change and extreme weather events as two of the greatest threats to national security and has made initial attempts to incorporate resiliency measures into installation master development and sustainment plans (DoD 2019). However, the results of these cursory efforts have primarily been limited in scope, lacking in implementation guidance, and minimal in effect. The largest contributor to this lack of infrastructure adaptation is that installations do not have experts to determine 3   climate projections and future extreme weather event possibilities or translate these threats into actionable adaptation measures (GAO 2019).  In 2019, Congress was dissatisfied with the DoD’s lack of climate and extreme weather adaptation progress and tasked the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) with evaluating the DoD’s efforts. The resulting report from this audit highlighted the DoD’s need to “update master planning criteria to assess extreme weather and climate change risks and to incorporate DoD guidance on the use of climate projections into facilities design standards.” (GAO 2019). Through the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP), the DoD crafted a series of Statements of Need for the development of tools and methods to address infrastructure resilience concerning climate change and extreme weather events over the lifetime of infrastructure and assets. The goal of these programs is to provide military and municipal decision-makers with strategies and policies to improve the overall resiliency of DoD’s infrastructure in the face of future climate condition uncertainty (SERDP 2019). This thesis is focused on addressing a portion of this need, through the development of a holistic adaptation pathway framework that coastal installation asset managers and planners can use to identify risks, downscale them to an actionable spatiotemporal resolution, and incorporate resilience adaptation measures into installation development and sustainment plans to combat hurricane intensification. 4   Problem Statement  DoD coastal installations are struggling to adapt existing infrastructure to withstand contemporary and future climate conditions, and extreme weather events (GAO, 2019). This lack of adaptation progress, combined with continued military development along the U.S. coast, puts billions of DoD assets in harm’s way from future hurricane event occurrences. If the DoD does not develop and implement effective adaptation measures, future hurricane events may cause unprecedented destruction resulting in severe degradation of mission capabilities, billions in asset recovery and losses, and potentially loss of life. Therefore, this research effort focuses on analyzing the risks associated with future, climate-intensified hurricane events and the development of dynamic adaptation pathways that base-level asset managers and planners can use to improve infrastructure resilience and inform installation master plans.  Research Objectives This thesis is focused on developing a dynamic infrastructure adaptation pathway framework to reduce the risk that coastal DoD installations face from future, climate-affected hurricane events. To accomplish this, research has been focused on addressing the following objectives: 1. Determine how climate change is expected to affect future hurricane behavior and what risks DoD coastal installations face throughout the 21st century. 2.   Apply multi-hazard modeling tools to simulate losses and intensities experienced by coastal installations from climate-intensified hurricanes. 5   3.   Develop infrastructure adaptation pathways to aid DoD decision-makers’ and planners’ incorporation of actionable resilience measures within installation development plans. Scope and Approach  To accomplish these research objectives, this thesis follows a scholarly format in which Chapters 3 and 4 are stand-alone, academic publications addressing research objectives 1, 2, and 3. Chapter 2 discusses relevant literature associated with infrastructure resilience and DoD funding decision matrices topics that are not covered in Chapters 3 or 4.   Chapter 3, “Resilient to what? Downscaling multi-hazard, tropical cyclone risk assessments for coastal cities to infrastructure system levels” addresses research objectives 1 and 2 by producing a model-based framework with which climate-intensified hurricane events can be simulated against coastal DoD installations. This framework first identifies how hurricane wind and surge intensities are forecasted to change over the remainder of the century due to climate projections. Specifically, SLR and global temperature parameters are analyzed as they are known to be correlated with hurricane intensities. FEMA Hazus Multi-Hazard (MH) software was used to simulate these climate change parameters, applied to a pre-determined hurricane profile (Appendix), along with tidal conditions, and produce probabilistic, climate-intensified hurricanes at Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin AFB) in the Florida Panhandle. Resultant intensities from the hurricanes are downscaled to infrastructure system-levels to determine how 6   spatiotemporal differences propagate across the installation. This article was presented at the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) 2020 Fall Meeting in December 2020 and is scheduled for submission to the Earth’s Future for publication consideration in spring 2021.   Chapter 4, “Dynamic adaptation using infrastructure system-level climate signals to inform strategies: an economic-based policy pathway comparison” addresses research objective 3 by developing a dynamic adaptive policy pathway (DAPP) model for Eglin AFB. The results from Chapter 3 are taken and applied to determine three possible adaptive strategies for sample facilities on the installations. These strategies are then combined to develop possible dynamic adaptation pathways that allow decision-makers to balance benefits, risks, and costs to determine implementation options throughout the remainder of the century. While this article is still in draft format, the target publishing journal for submission is Natural Hazards Review, which is managed by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The expected timeframe for submission is spring to summer of 2021.  Chapter 5 discusses the research conclusions, contributions, significance, and future recommendations associated with this thesis.     7   II. Literature Review Chapter Overview The purpose of this chapter is to summarize the relevant research associated with infrastructure resiliency and DoD infrastructure decision matrices topics not covered in Chapter 3 or 4. First, definitions and accepted practices of quantifying infrastructure resilience are discussed. Second, DoD infrastructure decision-processes are explained and analyzed to identify existing matrices in which adaptation pathways can be applied. These topics are combined with the results in Chapters 3 and 4 to formulate the conclusions of this thesis discussed in Chapter 5. Infrastructure Resilience  For the DoD, resilience has been a focus across many mission areas, including infrastructure (DoD Directive 4715.21, 2016). While multiple strategic directives have been issued urging installations to implement resilience measures in facilities and infrastructure systems (AFPD 10-24, 2019; DoD Directive 3020.40, 2016), there lacks any direction on how resilience is formally defined, or ‘to what’ extremes and levels infrastructure should be made resilient. Within the DoD, resilience has achieved somewhat of a buzzword status over the last decade (Herrera, 2021). While the term can be interpreted and quantified in various ways, there is a need for a standardized, measurable resiliency metric for DoD installations.  8    The original term for resilience was coined by C. S. Holling as, “…the measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance, and still maintain the same relationships between populations or state variables.” (1973). While Holling’s definition applied to ecological systems, it set the foundation for the concept of system resilience that applies to infrastructure. Specifically, when it comes to the maintenance and improvement of critical infrastructure systems, resilience is generally accepted as “the ability to resist, absorb, recover from or successfully adapt to adversity or a change in condition” (DHS, 2010). In this context, system resilience can be determined by the amount of impact prevented or absorbed from disruptive events before and after improvements are made (Figure 1).   Figure 1. Critical infrastructure resilience cycle (Rehawk et al., 2019)  This concept of measuring system resilience by comparing impact mitigation and avoidance caused by disruptive events or changing conditions has been applied in numerous asset-management research efforts. The first step in the traditional 9   measurement of resilience is determining the risk, which is defined as system vulnerability to some uncertain threat (Panteli et al., 2017). The next step is to implement adaptation-intervention to increase system robustness, targeted at loss or impact mitigation (Alderson et al., 2015, Rehawk et al., 2019). This change in impact is the measure of benefit for the infrastructure investments. However, such benefits may be costly to implement, either initially or through recurring maintenance expenses. Thus, implementing robust system improvements pre-maturely can reduce the overall resilience of infrastructure systems (Rose, 2017). Combining these resilience concepts leads to determining an infrastructure system’s resilience being the balance between probabilistic values for un-prevented risk, beneficial loss mitigation, and cost to implement (Franchin & Cavalieri, 2014).   Applying this definition of system resilience to coastal infrastructure facilities allows for resilience metrics to be calculated that can be used to inform policy and development plans. For example, benefits for infrastructure improvements to systems can be determined by measuring the loss avoidance from hurricane events, and the remaining loss potential would be the associated risk. These resilience metrics can then be incorporated with existing infrastructure investment decision processes, and balanced with decision-maker tolerances, to find optimal adaptation measures to implement.  Conglomerating sets of adaptation measures across many infrastructure systems creates a risk-based portfolio with which hurricane-protected infrastructure and installations can be achieved. 10   DoD Infrastructure Decision Processes  Traditionally, the DoD has utilized infrastructure criteria to prioritize sustainment, improvement, and construction expenditures. For the Air Force, these criteria are typically the Plant Replacement Value (PRV), Mission Dependency Index (MDI), and Condition Index (CI) scores tied to a specific infrastructure system, sub-system, or facility. The Air Force Comprehensive Asset Management Program (AFCAMP) currently uses a scoring system based upon existing asset’s Probability of Failure (PoF) and Consequence of Failure (CoF) scores to determine infrastructure projects worth funding each fiscal year (AFCEC 2019). An asset’s CoF is based primarily on its MDI and PoF is based on its CI score (Figure 2). This ultimately translates such that those assets with greater centrality to Air Force operations and degraded condition are most likely to receive funding in a given fiscal year. However, this does not consider system vulnerability to fail or sustain damage from disruptive events, such as hurricanes.  11    Figure 2: Sample AFCAMP project matrix based upon CoF and PoF (AFCEC, 2019)  Long-term use of this project prioritization methodology is forecasted to have negative impact on the overall condition of Air Force infrastructure. As bases compete for limited infrastructure funding sources, many struggle to maintain their current portfolios that are aging beyond intended service life. An overall Infrastructure Health Assessment (IHA) for the entire Air Force infrastructure portfolio (Figure 3) concluded that one-third of systems will reach failure states, and maintenance backlogs will increase from $25B to $89B by 2050 (Vandeveer, 2019). The IHA is also threat-unaware, meaning it does not consider risks such as hurricane vulnerability for coastal installations. This gap in the Air Force’s risk assessment methodology suggests that without proper adaptation measures, infrastructure system failure will occur throughout the century, and certainly beyond what is predicted in the IHA. 12    Figure 3: Air Force forecasted IHA (Vandeveer, 2019) PoF scores can consider several factors beyond conditions ratings to integrate infrastructure resiliency adaptation into existing funding practices. Non-condition-based projects, for which infrastructure adaptation would be considered, have scoring multipliers that account for cost savings, such as Specific Enterprise Execution Direction (SEED) and Enterprise Objectives (EO). Cost savings is a straight-forward economic analysis of the net benefit that a project provides the Air Force. Though traditionally focused on energy savings, exporting this component to evaluate resilience adaptation projects are possible provided project benefits versus risk factors can be calculated. SEEDs are based upon strategic directions from higher levels to specific base units. Currently, SEEDs are typically used to beddown specific units or missions at installations. However, SEEDs could be created for at-risk coastal installations and spur a ready supply of risk mitigation projects.  EOs are like SEEDs but are not installation-specific. These objectives are strategic enterprise directives that align installations with Air Force master plans and 13   doctrine. The current list of EO categories for project scoring is as follows; 1) mission resiliency in contested environment, 2) nuclear enterprise sustainment and modernization, 3) right-size mission footprint supporting mission and partners, 4) mitigate risk to mission essential functions, 5) mission assurance and redundancy features, 6) lifecycle reduction through partnership, and 7) restore military readiness and while building a more lethal force (AFCEC 2019). Infrastructure resilience could fall within one of the existing EO areas, such as 1 and 4, but applicability would be highly subjective to reviewing official discretion for whether the projects fit the EO directive. If a dedicated Air Force EO was made for infrastructure resiliency to align with the DoD and Congressional directives, then projects that directly reduce vulnerability from extreme weather events would be competitive for funding on the AFCAMP process. This would allow the Air Force to award installations projects that reduce risk, achieve infrastructure adaptation, and correspond with resiliency-focused master development and sustainment plans. Development of non-condition-based project scoring factors also could provide incentives for bases to implement and adopt adaptation strategies for infrastructure-systems. Since the abstract concept of infrastructure resilience is ill-defined for military installations, there is a lack of buy-in from bases to pursue adaptation (GAO, 2019). Rather, installations are focused on maintaining the infrastructure systems they have with limited funding and labor resources. Therefore, even if resilience projects were conceptualized, most installations would not pursue them due to a lack of incentive to do 14   so, other than strategic directives stating that they ‘should.’ If separate funding resources or additional project scoring prioritization were applied to long-term, resilience-focused projects and installation master plans, then there would be a stronger pull for installations to pursue them (Narayanan et al., 2019). Providing such incentives for coastal bases would help meet DoD and Congressional directives, and implement projects that would be of greatest benefit to reducing future climate and hurricane risks.  Summary and Way Forward While the existing literature provides components of a framework with which coastal infrastructure resilience could be measured and incorporated into existing Air Force funding practices, there exists a gap for the development of a cohesive approach to producing adaptation pathways that Air Force asset managers can use take action to promote mission assurance through infrastructure resilience. Chapters 3 and 4 address this gap to provide an adaptation framework for coastal installations to use that compares benefits, risks, and costs of adaptation against probabilistic, climate-intensified hurricane events.      15   III. Scholarly Article 1: Resilient to what? Downscaling multi-hazard, tropical cyclone risk assessments for coastal cities to infrastructure system levels  Abstract Tropical cyclones have intensified and are expected to continue strengthening throughout the 21st century due to climate change impacts. Storm intensification poses a serious threat to coastal municipalities and infrastructure that are not designed to withstand future wind and storm surge potential. Coupled modeling software has been widely used to replicate extreme weather events and simulate forecasted climate change effects to understand the magnitude of vulnerability coastal regions face. However, these studies are often conducted at too coarse resolutions to provide decision-makers with actionable information for infrastructure-level adaptation. This study addresses this limitation using a coupled modeling approach by simulating climate-intensified hurricane events at Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) along the Florida Panhandle. The study simulates hurricane impacts throughout the 21st century using multi-threat, probabilistic projections of storm surge, sea-level rise, and wind intensification. Hazus Multi-Hazard software is used to simulate hurricanes at four threat horizons for five possible climate change scenarios. Storm intensities are downscaled to the facility-level using geographic information system software to determine the spatiotemporal impact on Eglin AFB’s infrastructure. This analysis provides asset managers with likely intensities that buildings will experience and helps determine when and to what extent vulnerable facilities need to 16   be made resilient. Results show Eglin AFB could sustain between $773 million and $1.8 billion (2020 USD) in facility damage by the end of the century. This methodology can be applied to other coastal municipalities, provided adjustments are made to fit regional conditions and extremes, and could be used to inform infrastructure adaptation and development plans.  Plain Language Summary Extreme weather events, including hurricanes, pose a serious threat to coastal communities. This threat is expected to increase throughout the remainder of the century from storm intensification due to climate change. While previous research has evaluated hurricane threats and climate change intensification, most of these efforts have focused on singular parameters such as wind speeds and sea-level rise at large spatial scales, and for specific timeframes. There is a need to apply multi-threat, coupled models to be used in comprehensive evaluations of extreme weather events’ impact on municipalities at the infrastructure-system level. Results from simulating multiple, climate-intensified hurricanes at Eglin Air Force Base show that the installation could sustain between $773 million to $1.8 billion in damages by the end of the century. Analyzing these results at the facility-level allows for adaptation decisions to be made on which buildings need to be protected and what protection levels are needed to reduce losses.    17   1 Introduction There is growing global concern over the impact of climate change on tropical cyclones (TCs), and their threat to coastal communities and infrastructure portfolios (Pielke & Pielke, 1997; Mendelsohn et al., 2011; Peduzzi et al., 2012). Hurricanes, TCs with sustained wind speeds greater than 64 kts (74 mph), making landfall in the U.S. have increased in intensity (Fraza & Elsner, 2014), and are expected to continue strengthening, though non-uniformly across space and time throughout the 21st century (Meehl et al. 2000; Elsner et al., 2008; Villarini & Vecchi, 2013). While TC frequency is expected to decrease overall (Walsh et al., 2016), the number of extreme TCs (Category 4 and 5 hurricanes) are expected to increase in occurrence, potentially doubling in frequency by the end of the century (Bacmeister et al., 2016; Bender et al., 2010; Emanuel, 2013). Evidence of this trend can be seen by comparing past hurricane seasons, as damages and fatalities stemming from Atlantic Ocean storm activity in the U.S. have increased dramatically. Sixteen of the top 20 costliest hurricanes on record have occurred since 2000, causing $32.2 trillion (2020 USD) in total damages (NHC, 2020). The historical frequency of TCs has increased as well, with 15 named storms and three major hurricanes occurring on average, each season between 2000 and 2019. This represents a 150% increase in frequency and magnitude compared to 1980-1999 averages (NHC, n.d.-b). The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season alone produced 30 named storms and four major hurricanes, making it the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record (NHC, n.d.-a).  18   Most coastal communities and organizations, including Department of Defense’s (DoD) installations, struggle to adapt asset portfolios to be resilient against TC threats and therefore face substantial risk in terms of infrastructure losses (Contento et al., 2019; Pilkington & Mahmoud, 2016; Woodruff et al., 2018). Loss risk from TCs is compounded by population growth and the attractiveness of infrastructure development in coastal areas, putting more people and assets in harm’s way (Crossett et al., 2013; Hauer et al., 2016; Neumann et al., 2015). While the threat has become apparent, there is still a considerable amount of uncertainty in determining the true magnitude of risk that coastal communities face as the population and the built environment change over time. Historically, regional TC climatology or storm-of-record events have driven coastal community risk assessments and infrastructure design codes (Dehring & Halek, 2013; Simmons et al., 2019). As infrastructure adaptation is expensive and socio-politically sensitive, it is easier for decision-makers to gain support for adaptation to events that have already transpired than it is to rely on projections of future possibilities, which are uncertain or unaccepted (Akerlof et al., 2013; Shao et al., 2017).  Reevaluation of design standards is typically reactive and undertaken when the storm-of-record is superseded, as was the case when Miami-Dade standards were implemented after Hurricane Andrew (Simmons et al., 2019). This reactive design practice causes coastal municipalities to be extremely vulnerable as climate change effects cause uncertainty with possible future TC event intensities. While most adaptation efforts have been reactive, some coastal municipalities are beginning to develop 19   adaptation strategies based on climate projections (Shi & Varuzzo, 2020; Xie et al., 2019). However, cities possess little guidance or mandated documents to drive actionable adaptation (Woodruff & Stults, 2016) and regularly postpone implementation to meet short-term budgetary demands (Shi & Varuzzo, 2020). A primary struggle in gaining support for adaptation is the quantifying and understanding of future uncertainties that infrastructure needs to be made resilient against (Kwakkel et al., 2016). Research conducted on uncertainty quantification for coastal regions has underlined this need for adaptation, but these studies are traditionally broad in scope and lack specific implementation recommendations that infrastructure managers require to make informed adaptation decisions (Woodruff & Stults, 2016). An additional gap in research exists in producing and downscaling multi-hazard, climate intensification-informed damage assessments at the infrastructure-level (Li & Ellingwood, 2006). In the context of TCs, which are multi-hazard by nature (Misuri et al., 2019), an analysis might consider the combined impacts of wind and surge flooding (Li et al., 2012). Combining storm threat criteria can enable a holistic assessment of TC damage potential, so long as the interconnections between threats are designed appropriately (Kappes et al., 2012). Calculating damages from individual parameters, such as wind alone, or simple aggregation of damages ignores the interconnectivity of storm parameters, which can lead to under-estimation of true damage potential or double counting of damages sustained from multiple hazards (Pilkington & Mahmoud, 2016). For example, a wind model combined with a storm surge model may overestimate losses 20   if damage to infrastructure is caused by both parameters (Pei et al., 2018). Conversely, there might be cases where the compound impacts of wind and rain magnify damages not captured by simple aggregation alone (Silva de Abreu et al., 2020). This limitation can be overcome by using coupled modeling processes and simulation tools, such as open-access software like FEMA’s Hazus-MH program or coupled estimation frameworks (Barbato et al., 2013) that account for multi-hazard criteria and their interconnectivity. This study explores the use of such modeling software and fills this knowledge gap.  If it is the goal of storm simulation research to answer the question: “What degree must infrastructure be made resilient?”, it is natural to expect that new design standards will emerge as an adaptation method. However, it is inefficient to establish a single design standard needed to achieve long-term resilience, as this might lead to overdesign or premature adaptation (Dehring & Halek, 2013). Furthermore, not considering facility importance and condition when applying a uniform building standard will drive excessive expenditures in terms of initial construction and recurring maintenance costs (Simmons et al., 2019). Analyzing storm threats must be done both temporally and spatially to enable effective development of adaptation standards to inform policy (Pei et al., 2014), and determine likely intensities and their timeframe for individual facility damage mitigation (Masoomi et al., 2019). Therefore, modelers must consider various climate change projection scenarios to ensure standards are robust enough for future intensity possibilities. Comparing the severity of damage intensities and probabilities across multiple threat horizons allows for adaptation signals to be identified of when 21   improvements are needed to achieve maximum threat avoidance (Stephens et al., 2018). This concept of using risk signals to trigger adaptation is crucial to adapting infrastructure to changing conditions over time (Haasnoot et al., 2013) and mitigating the threat TCs pose to coastal cities.  Considering the limitations of the aforementioned literature, highlighted by the gap between the coarseness of storm model predictions and the demand for additional granularity in risk assessments, the objective of this research is to analyze the potential effects of climate change on TC activity at the facility level for coastal communities. The results address three questions: 1) How will climate change affect TC strength and risk to coastal communities and infrastructure over time? 2) How can multi-hazard, coupled modeling be used to develop damage estimates and determine the spatial importance of individual threats from intensified storms? 3) How can analyzing storm activity at the infrastructure system level be beneficial in improving coastal resiliency? This study applies a multi-hazard, coupled model at the infrastructure system-level to answer these questions through a case study analysis of Eglin Air Force Base (AFB), located in the Florida Panhandle, which the current infrastructure at the installation is simulated against major probabilistic hurricanes occurring at various threat horizons throughout the 21st century. Hazus software was used to simulate these hurricane events, and spatiotemporal analysis at the facility level was performed to produce the likely intensities that buildings will experience over the remainder of the century. While this research is focused on a specific region, the methodology framework presented here can be applied to other 22   coastal municipalities; provided adjustments are made for regional conditions, extremes, and geospatial infrastructure parameters are known or available. 2 Data and Methods 2.1 Methodology Overview The multi-hazard modeling approach developed in this work combines existing climate change projections with historical hurricane profile parameters to generate facility-level damage loss estimates for storm occurrence at four threat horizons (2020, 2035, 2065, 2100). These threat horizons are coupled with five different climate projections of increasing severity (Lowest, Low, Moderate, High, Highest). This simulation is accomplished in four parts: 1) production of a multi-threat TC damage framework, calibrated to a previously performed analysis for Eglin; 2) aggregation of climate-intensified hurricane parameters; 3) construction and simulation of intensified hurricane scenarios to produce census tract-level damage estimates; and 4) downscaling of hurricane damage outputs to the facility level through coupling with Eglin AFB’s building inventory data. Figure 1 shows the methodological sequence performed for each climate change scenario across the threat horizons, which resulted in 16 simulated storms. 23    Figure 1. Methodological sequence for threat horizon storm simulations. Labels correspond with methodology sections discussed below. 2.2 Eglin Study Region and Prior Research  Eglin AFB is a major U.S. military installation located in northwestern Florida, bordering the Gulf Coast (Figure 2). The installation is the largest in the Air Force, in terms of size, encompassing over 1,870 km2 (460,000 acres). It consists of over 3,000 facilities with a total plant replacement cost of $9 billion, supporting 9,500 active-duty military members and their families (DoD, 2018). Elevation for the installation ranges from -0.4 m (-1.3 ft) below mean sea level (MSL) along the shoreline to 28 m (92 ft) above MSL in northern woodland regions. Eglin AFB was selected as the study region of interest due to its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, which has experienced increased hurricane activity, and its compatibility with coastal communities. Additionally, available data included facility-level datasets and GIS information, enabling the downscaling of damage risk. Lastly, Eglin AFB was the subject of previous hurricane, wind-only threat 24   assessments (Elsner et al., 2011; Scheitlin et al., 2011; Scheitlin & Elsner, 2009). These studies provided the platform for calibration and a hurricane profile that was expanded upon for simulating intensification.  Prior assessments of Eglin AFB’s vulnerability to TC activity determined that there is a high likelihood of a ‘worst-case’ hurricane event occurring by the end of the century as determined by analysis of historical hurricanes occurring within 150 km (93 miles) of Eglin AFB from 1851-2008. This storm, consisting of extreme 100-year return wind speeds, has the potential to cause severe damage to the installation. The total economic impact was estimated to be $664 million (2020 USD) in damage and revenue loss to residential and commercial buildings without considering specific government facilities (Scheitlin et al., 2011). Solely due to increasing sea-surface temperatures (SST), wind damages were estimated to be 36% greater at Eglin AFB by the end of the century (Elsner et al., 2011). These assessments used Hazus-MH hurricane modeling software to simulate storms, translated along a manually defined track, intended to maximize the destructive impact of winds. The model was formulated based on four profile parameters: translation speed, radius to maximum wind, wind speed, and central pressure. The storm made landfall on the western side of Eglin AFB before continuing inland (Scheitlin & Elsner, 2010). As this previous research shows, wind forces alone pose a significant threat to Eglin AFB, and infrastructure resiliency improvements would reduce this risk. However, the lack of geospatial data on storm intensities makes resiliency adaptation difficult for 25   decision-makers to prioritize infrastructure maintenance and improvements within budgetary limitations. While the analysis of Eglin AFB’s vulnerability to hurricane-force winds is extensive, there is room for more robust and comprehensive damage assessments. Specifically, this study focuses on the facility-level and models damage risk stemming from interconnected wind intensities and storm surge inundation simulated through multiple climate change intensified storms. Geospatial analysis of Eglin AFB’s impact by both wind intensities and storm surge inundations advances the understanding of holistic threat at the facility-level that the installation faces, allowing for robust decision-making to be done in terms of prioritization and identification of building resiliency adaptation signals.  Figure 2. Eglin AFB study region located in the northwestern Florida Panhandle. The simulated hurricane track passes through the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall. The hurricane symbol shown is to illustrate track and is not to scale with the actual storm size. 26   2.3 Hazus-MH  Hazus is a geographic analysis tool developed by FEMA to simulate and analyze extreme weather event likelihood, impact, and regional recovery for emergency management purposes. While multiple storm simulation models exist, many of these tools are not open-source and may require specialized training to operate. For use and uptake by DoD and coastal community planners, models should be available at low to no cost and produce interpretable and actionable results. Aside from the necessary addition of ArcMap, which is a tool most planners and community engineers have available, Hazus satisfies these requirements. Additionally, training and technical manuals are regularly updated and provided by FEMA, including reach-back support. Hazus can perform detailed modeling of extreme weather events (earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tsunamis) and can be coupled with census and topographic data to produce various desired outputs (Pluss et al., 2018). Hazus has been widely used to model extreme weather event intensities and impact simulations (McGrath et al., 2015; Pei et al., 2018), and the results have been found to closely replicate artificial wind tunnel, small scale flooding models, and real-world events (Vickery et al., 2006; Vickery et al., 2009; Elsner et al., 2011). Hazus hurricane and flood modeling software were used in this study to produce the damage loss estimates and storm intensities of both wind fields and storm surge inundation heights at Eglin AFB.    27   2.3.1 Hurricane Model  Hazus hurricane models can be operated in many modes, simulating manually defined, historical, or probabilistic hurricane events for a region of interest. The region of interest is customizable and can be as small as a single census tract. For Eglin AFB, the hurricane parameters from Scheitlin et al. (2011) were used to calibrate Hazus before expanding the analysis to the multi-hazard domain. The hurricane wind analysis outputs were used to determine wind intensities experienced by each census tract, which then served as inputs for the storm surge analysis, ultimately producing the multi-threat damage estimation. A complete description of the hurricane wind modeling process can be found in the Hazus hurricane technical manual (FEMA, 2018b). 2.3.2 Flood Model Coastal surge analysis produced by the hurricane models were incorporated into Hazus flood models to produce combined wind and surge intensities, and damage estimates. Regional topographic digital elevation model (DEM) data was first obtained for Eglin AFB from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Map at the 1/3 arc-second interval to accomplish the storm surge analysis. Next, a coastal surge analysis consisting of both a surge elevation grid, as determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model and a significant wave height grid using a Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model were run. This surge analysis was performed for each climate change scenario across the threat horizons. Floodplains for each scenario were then delineated 28   from the SLOSH and SWAN models, completing the Hazus surge flooding analysis. Hazus used the analysis results to calculate the combined wind and storm surge loss estimates for each scenario. A complete description of the flooding model process can be found in the Hazus flood technical manual (FEMA, 2018a). 2.4 Climate Change Scenarios 2.4.1 Sea-Level Rise (SLR) Storm surge is widely accepted as the most lethal and costly aspect of TCs, and estimates suggest it is responsible for 60% of the $36 billion annual economic loss to residential and commercial sectors in the U.S. (CBO, 2019). It is projected that high-tide conditions combined with SLR alone will produce regular flooding events for coastal locations that exceed contemporary storm surge extremes, referred to as recurrent or “nuisance flooding” (Moftakhari et al., 2017; Taherkhani et al., 2020). Scheitlin et al. (2011) omitted the impact of storm surge from damage estimates for Eglin AFB, likely because storm surge has not traditionally been a threat due to its inland geographical location, elevation, and the protection provided by natural barriers. However, it remains unclear whether these attributes will be overcome by intensified storm surge when coupled with climate change-informed expectations for SLR (Hall et al., 2016; Sweet et al., 2017). While the uncertainty associated with regional SLR projections vary, several agencies have produced comprehensive forecast predictions for the remainder of the century, such as NOAA. For DoD’s coastal installations, the U.S. Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) evaluates and forecasts 29   SLR potential at military installations, using a wide variety of climate change models and tools. SERDP’s Regionalized Sea Level Change & Extreme Water Level Scenarios tool generates five possible SLR scenarios based on NOAA data and Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) greenhouse gas accumulation scenarios. Using the SERDP tool for Eglin AFB, the most conservative of these scenarios, labeled ‘Lowest,’ estimates that SLR will only increase 0.3 m (1 ft) by the end of the century. The most extreme scenario, ‘Highest,’ predicts SLR could rise as much as 2.3 m (7.5 ft). SLR values were used as inputs in the Hazus models at each threat horizon and accounted for each scenario produced by SERDP.  2.4.2 Tide Conditions Sea-level rise is not the only hydrologic parameter that affects storm surge inundation. Tidal conditions impact wave behavior, and during a TC can intensify storm surge and produce a ‘storm tide.’ Storm tide-influenced floods have consistently caused damages exceeding $1 billion (Smith & Katz, 2013) and account for approximately 50% of fatalities during TC events (Rappaport, 2014). To further replicate the worst-case conditions for the simulated storms, high-tide levels were added to SLR estimates at each threat horizon. Previous five-year high-tide averages were taken for the region from the Pensacola, FL monitoring station (Station 8729840), the closest available station to Eglin AFB (NOAA, n.d.). Tide conditions were taken during August through October, which corresponds to the Atlantic’s peak hurricane season period. This resulted in an MSL baseline of 0.55 m (1.8 ft).  30   2.4.3 Wind Strength  The exact effect of climate change on TC wind intensities is not fully understood (Walsh et al., 2016). Several studies have been conducted with respect to evaluating TC intensity change due to singular influences, such as SST and global temperature rise (Bhatia et al., 2018; Fraza & Elsner, 2015; Knutson et al., 2019). Expert opinions on end of century predictions for TC wind intensity are mixed, though the consensus is that major TC wind intensities will be greater than or equal to contemporary values (Cui & Caracoglia, 2016; Fraza et al., 2016; Villarini & Vecchi, 2013). Research performed on evaluating TC maximum intensity in the North Atlantic basin due to SST sensitivity predicted that a 1° C change might result in 10.7-13.6 kts (12.3-15.7 mph) higher wind speeds (Strazzo et al., 2016). Additional forecasts suggest TCs intensity increases of 1-10% for every 2°C global temperature change is likely (Knutson et al., 2019). Combining this range for TC intensity increases with global temperature projections ranging from 1-5°C throughout the end of the century (O’Neill et al., 2016) create a potential range of TC wind intensity increase of 1-30%, which falls within the broad range of wind intensity increase expectations (Bhatia et al., 2018; Strazzo et al., 2016). Wind field multipliers for the 2100 threat horizon intensities were then derived from this range to produce the simulated TC wind strengths at Eglin AFB for the five climate change scenarios. End of the century wind field multiplier values ranged at 5% increments from a 1.05 multiplier for the Lowest scenario, representing a 1°C change, to upwards of 1.25 for the Highest scenario. It is assumed that wind intensity increases will follow an exponential trend 31   throughout the century, like SLR and SST, due to the positive correlation between wind and temperature (Michaels et al., 2006; Strazzo et al., 2013). Wind intensity multiplier values, along with SLR and tide heights, are shown for all climate scenarios and threat horizons in Table 1.  Table 1. Hazus threat horizon wind intensity multiplier and SLR parameters.  Climate scenario Threat horizon 2020 2035 2065 2100 MSL (m) Wind multiplier (%) SLR (m) Wind multiplier (%) SLR (m) Wind multiplier (%) SLR (m) Highest 0.55 1.009 0.40 1.08 0.98 1.25 2.29 High 1.007 0.30 1.06 0.70 1.20 1.68 Moderate 1.005 0.30 1.05 0.49 1.15 1.10 Low 1.004 0.18 1.03 0.30 1.10 0.58 Lowest 1.002 0.18 1.02 0.18 1.05 0.30 Wind fields are not singular values but multiplied to all coordinate points throughout the storm track. Initial sea levels used for surge analysis consisted of SLR values added to the baseline, high-tide MSL. 2.5 GIS Facility Data  GIS data produced by Hazus for the wind field intensities and storm surge inundation heights were overlaid with Eglin facility data in ArcMap to downscale impacts to the facility-level. Eglin facility data was obtained from the Air Force GeoBase GIS database, which contains specific geographic shapefile polygons, including size, importance to Eglin operations, replacement cost, and location. As expected, most facilities (44.6%) are in the main base sector (Figure 3), which is equivalent to a 32   community’s downtown. Due to security requirements, three generalized facilities are discussed here to show the effect of simulated hurricane impacts at the facility-level, across the threat horizons. These buildings, referred to as Facility A, B, and C, are purposefully chosen to represent the diversity in functions, replacement costs, and mission importance of facilities within Eglin. Furthermore, each facility was selected from different locations around the installation (Figure 3) to illustrate the geospatial effects of storm intensities within even a relatively small area and how they can inform specific infrastructure adaptation decisions.   Figure 3. Facility A, B, and C generalized locations on Eglin AFB main base sector. Facility A is a community support/recreation facility of low importance to Eglin AFB, Facility B is an office/administrative facility of moderate importance, and Facility C is an operational facility of high importance.  33   3 Results 3.1 Wind Intensity  Hazus wind outputs varied due to the variation in climate projections used to inform the wind field multipliers across the threat horizons. For the 2020 baseline storm, the maximum wind speed (𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚) was determined to be 113 kts (130 mph) at landfall and decreased to 108 kts (124 mph) as the storm moved inland, making it resemble a Category 3 hurricane. At the 2035 threat horizon, 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 was relatively unchanged, though, by 2065, it rose to 118 kts (136 mph), which elevated the hurricane to a Category 4. At 2100, 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 rises to 130 kts (149 mph), but the range of intensity potential is the most diverse of the threat horizons, with an interquartile range of 123-136 kts (142-157 mph). Though 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 variance increases with each threat horizon, which reflects model and input uncertainty, the general results suggest that the expected TC event would transition from a Category 3 hurricane to a severe Category 4 by the end of the century at the median (Figure 4). Landfall intensities increase consistently; the maximum potential 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 at any given threat horizon is less than the 25th percentile value of subsequent threat horizon.  34    Figure 4. 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚  inter-quartile ranges produced across the climate change scenarios at each threat horizon. 2020 baseline 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is 113 kts (130 mph) and ranges of 𝑣𝑣𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚  are 112.8 - 113.6 kts (129.8 - 130.7 mph), 114.4 - 121.5 kts (131.6 – 139.8 mph), and 118.2 - 140.7 kts (136.0 – 161.9 mph) in 2035, 2065, and 2100, respectively.  3.2 Storm Surge  Storm surge inundations produced by the Hazus models show how SLR and tidal conditions affect the number of facilities threatened over the century. As mentioned above, storm surge has not historically been a significant concern for Eglin due to its geographic parameters. For the 2020 hurricane, storm surge produced at high tide is 5.7 m (18.7 ft) for some coastal regions of the base, but these areas are largely uninhabited and result in little to no facility damage. On the main base, where the bulk of buildings 35   are located, storm surge heights were 1.8-2.7 m (6-9 ft) and threatened a small portion of buildings (< 30). As the century progresses, storm surge potential increases across most modeling scenarios (Figure 5). While 2035 scenarios only produce a small (< 0.5 m (1.6 ft)) increase in storm surge heights, the 2065 and 2100 scenarios produced drastically higher inundations. At the 2065 threat horizon, the increase in storm surge to Eglin AFB ranged from 1 m (3.3 ft) in the Lowest scenario to 2.6 m (8.6 ft) in the Highest scenario, threatening 479 - 632 facilities, respectively. For 2100, storm surge increase ranges from 1.6 m (5.3 ft) to 4.9 m (16 ft) between Lowest and Highest scenarios and threatened 530 – 837 facilities, respectively. The total number of facilities for all of Eglin AFB affected by storm surge inundation rises from 419 (12.9% of total facilities) in 2020 to 837 (25.8%) by 2100 for the Highest climate change scenario. This means that the number of surge-affected buildings could double between 2020 and 2100. Surge maps for climate-intensified storms like this can be utilized to identify flooding zones and highlight facilities that are susceptible to future storm surge inundations for adaptation planning.  36    Figure 5. Storm surges increase between 2020 and threat horizon Highest, Moderate, and Lowest climate scenarios for 2065 and 2100. 2035 surges not shown due to insignificant increase (< 0.5 m (1.6 ft)) from 2020 values. The coarse boundaries of storm surge heights are a result of Hazus and more sophisticated flood modeling software could produce higher resolutions. 3.3 Multi-Hazard Damage Estimates  The simulations produced a variety of loss estimates across the threat horizons. Conducting a two-tailed, t-distribution analysis on the outputs illustrates that Eglin AFB faces facility damages of $1.8 billion [($2.45B, $1.16B) = 90% confidence interval (CI)] for a storm occurring by 2100 (Figure 6). This is a 133% increase of potential loss [(216%, 50%), 90% CI] from the $773 million damage potential of the 2020 baseline storm. A comparison of damage by threat shows that wind forces cause the most 37   significant portion of damage. While storm surge, which is influenced by the combination of SLR and tide, is less destructive than wind; it accounts for 35% of storm damage in 2020 and 20% in 2100. The storm simulated is classified as “wind-driven”, which is an artifact of the Scheitlin et al. (2011) hurricane profile development. As such, the escalation in damage from wind compared to surge is not unexpected. Damage loss estimates follow an exponential curve across the threat horizons, which aligns with storm parameter intensification. This means that while increases in loss potential continuously occur throughout the threat horizons, damage potential due to climate change will be comparatively larger as the century progresses. As estimates were only taken at the threat horizons, an exponential fit was used to approximate values between threat horizons.       38    Figure 6. Hazus damage estimations with 90% confidence interval bounds based upon t-distribution statistical analysis. Baseline 2020 losses were estimated to be $773M and threat horizon estimates were $800M + $45M, $1,000M + $150M, and $1,800M + $650M in 2035, 2065, and 2100, respectively. Wind accounts for the most significant proportion of damage to the study region.  3.4 Eglin AFB Facility Impact  As expected, impact at the facility level varies by location and across threat horizons for the simulated hurricanes (Table 2). Facilities A and B experience identical wind intensities across the threat horizons, while Facility C experiences slightly higher intensities. This is due to Facility C being located west of A and B and closer to the storm track. However, Facility A will be exposed to storm surge potential by 2065, whereas Facilities B and C will not be threatened by storm surge, as they are located inland. The 39   use of these climate signals allows for asset managers to make targeted, robust decisions to achieve infrastructure resiliency goals.  Table 2.
