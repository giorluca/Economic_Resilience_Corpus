Economic evaluation of ion-exchange processes for nutrient removal and recovery from municipal wastewater

ARTICLE OPENEconomic evaluation of ion-exchange processes for nutrientremoval and recovery from municipal wastewaterXiangjun Huang 1, Samuela Guida1, Bruce Jefferson 1 and Ana Soares 1✉Ion exchange (IEX) processes are a promising alternative to remove and recover nutrients from municipal wastewater. To assess thefeasibility and viability of IEX processes for full-scale application, this study aimed at providing an evaluation of performance andeconomics on upscaling these processes for two different configurations in a 10,000 population equivalent wastewater treatmentplant (WWTP) and compared them with a traditional biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant. The IEX processes were designedbased on existing pilot-scale data, and after aerobic or anaerobic carbon removal stages. The nutrients were recovered from spentregenerants in the form of (NH4)2SO4 and hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3(OH), allowing regenerant reuse. The 40-year whole life cost(WLC) of IEX coupled with traditional activated sludge processes was estimated to be ~£7.4 M, and WLC of IEX coupled withanaerobic membrane process was estimated to be £6.1 M, which was, respectively, 17% and 27% less than the traditional BNRbased WWTP. Furthermore, ~98 tonnes of (NH4)2SO4 and 3.4 tonnes of Ca3(PO4)2 could be recovered annually. The benefits of lowercosts, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient recovery aligned with circular economy, illustrated that IEX processes areattractive for nutrient removal and recovery from municipal wastewater.npj Clean Water             (2020) 3:7 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-020-0054-xINTRODUCTIONExcess nutrients released from wastewater treatment plants(WWTPs) can lead to eutrophication with detrimental effects tothe aquatic environment. Consequently, existing legislationprovides stringent control of WWTPs discharges, limiting to1mg NH4-N/L and as low as 0.5 mg PO4-P/L1. On the other hand,nutrients are essential to all life forms, and should be recovered,particularly phosphorus considering the fast depletion of naturalreserves2. Nutrient recovery can also enable alternative revenuestreams and is aligned with the delivery of the circular economy3.Although activated sludge process variations, such as biologicalnutrient removal (BNR), predominate in WWTPs nowadays4, ionexchange (IEX) processes are rarely applied in municipal waste-water treatment. The main reasons are limited media selectivity,bed clogging, and costly regenerations. Nevertheless, recentadvances are tackling these limitations, and IEX processes arebeing considered for nutrient removal and recovery frommunicipal wastewater. More specifically, recent studies demon-strated that mesolite, a synthetically produced zeolite, has a highcapacity for ammonia (NH4-N) adsorption with reported values of4.6 and 4.9 meq/g, compared with 2.0 meq/g for Clinoptilolite5.The outstanding performance of synthetic zeolites is attributed tothe increased consistency Si:Al ratios of 1:1, defining a high cationexchange capacity5. A comparison experiment with differentempty bed contact times (EBCT) suggested 10min to be a balancepoint between performance and costs for ammonia removal withmesolite6. Furthermore, the tests showed that regenerant can bere-used for consecutive cycles before clean-up, and to reachbreakthrough point of 1 mg NH4-N/L, the process could beoperated for 1000 bed volumes (BV). Nevertheless, this isdependent on ammonia concentrations and 300–400 BV betweenregenerations is expected if 10–20mg NH4-N/L is in the influent7.The study also revealed that potassium chloride regenerant wasmore effective than sodium chloride with the efficiencies rangedbetween 72 and 94 and 64–68%, respectively. In addition,potassium chloride was less consumed as it still remained effectivedown to 0.1 M, at the same regeneration efficiency as of 1.0 Msodium chloride6. Five BV KCl solution (10%) was found effectiveto regenerate the mesolite at higher PH value. The pH can beadjusted to 12 by adding 2% NaOH solution.As for phosphorus removal by IEX, one of the most promisingmedia is hybrid ion exchange resins (HAIX) with ferric oxidenanoparticles embedded within the base structure of the resin.The removal of phosphorus with HAIX is believed to be moreefficient than chemical precipitation or biological methods,especially when removing down to very low level (<0.1 mg PO4-P/L)8. The high capacity of HAIX results in extended operatingcycles. For instance, the bed life of HAIX, treating a wastewaterwith an initial phosphorous concentration of 0.26 mg/L, demon-strated an order of magnitude greater (from 200 to 2000 BVs) thanthat of a conventional ion exchanger, IRA-9009. A realisticexpectation of operational capacity at full scale was estimated at4.9–6.2 mg P/g media with an EBCT of 5 min but capacity wasreduced to 2.5 and 3.7 mg P/g media after multiple runs. A 10 BVNaOH solution (2–4%) was found effective to regenerate the HAIXand the regenerant could be re-used 10 times before requiringclean-up9.Although these ion-exchange processes look promising, thefrequent regenerations with new chemical solution every time andhigh costs (typically £65/ton) for disposal of spent regenerant ashazardous waste were found non-economical in the long-termrun10.Recovery of the regenerants is critical to ensure economicfeasibility. Recent studies indicated that a promising solution is toclean-up and reuse the spent regenerant whilst recovering thenutrients at the same time. The clean-up of KCl regenerant andammonia recovery in the form of ammonium sulphate can beachieved using commercially available modules of hollow fibremembrane contactor (HFMC) with sulphuric acid6. The phos-phorus can be recovered in the form of calcium phosphate1Cranfield Water Science Institute, Cranfield University, Cranfield MK43 0AL, UK. ✉email: a.soares@cranfield.ac.ukwww.nature.com/npjcleanwaterPublished in partnership with King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals1234567890():,;(hydroxyapatite) by adding hydrated lime to the spent NaOHregenerant leading to instant formation of hydroxyapatiteCa5(PO4)3(OH) that can be separated from the liquid by filtration7.Media replacement was estimated after 600 regeneration cycles,although this also needs further verification at a demonstration orfull scale7.Besides technology, other challenges also remain to hinder thenutrient recovery. These include a lack of viable commercialisationpathway, and limited understanding of the recovered productsmarkets11. This study aims at providing an evaluation ofperformance and economics of IEX processes as tertiary treatmentprocess, for both ammonia and phosphorus removal and recovery,after traditional activated sludge process (aimed at carbonremoval) or anaerobic treatment with a combined upflowanaerobic sludge blanket and membrane reactor (anMBR)compared with traditional BNR combined with iron dosing for a10,000 population equivalent (PE) municipal WWTP.RESULTSDesign, mass and energy balancesThe designed processes and mass balance are shown in Fig. 1. Theresults demonstrate that all the flowsheets investigated, BNR+iron dosing, ASP+ IEX and AnMBR+ IEX processes could producethe desired effluent quality of COD < 20mg/L, NH4-N < 1mg/L andPO4-P < 0.5 mg/L. Nevertheless, process stability was different.More specifically, the BNR process was sensitive to lowtemperature, shock loads and dependent on carbon availabilityand struggled to reach very high nutrient removal rates (>95%)required to meet stringent nutrient discharge limits (<1mg NH4-N/L, <0.5 mg PO4-P/L). Fundamentally, the reasons for instabilitywere owing to competition on carbon sources uptake, especiallyfor low-strength wastewater. According to influent characteristicsand effluent quality requirement, COD removal rate must beabove 93%, and phosphate removal rate must be above 85%,which could not be realised simultaneously with ammoniumremoval by BNR only. Therefore, supplementary processes weredesigned for further removal, including ferric dosing and a tertiaryfilter. The consumption of ferric salt was estimated to be 6438 kg/year, which was double theoretically calculated demand to ensurethe removal efficiency. Reported optimum weight ratios for iron,have varied from <1 to as high as 7.5. The US EPA (USEPA, 1987)suggests that a weight ratio between 2 and 3 of Fe:P is needed toachieve 95 percent removal of phosphorus from municipalwastewater12. Regarding energy consumption, aeration consumedthe most of energy required for the BNR+ iron dosing up asanticipated13 (Fig. 2).In the ASP+ IEX flowsheet, the conventional activated sludgeprocess (ASP) was effective and capable of removing 90% BODand COD14,15 (Fig. 1). The IEX process was effective and capable ofremoving ammonia and phosphate to the required low level oreven very low level such as <0.1 mg PO4-P/L. There was additionalbenefit of 40–50% COD removal by HAIX media, which wasbelieved to be associated with base resin of the HAIX media8.Others have demonstrated that IEX processes can be impacted bychanges in temperature and initial pollutant concentrations (e.g.,diurnal shock loads) owing to standard chemical kinetics and masstransfer limitations16. Nevertheless, the fact regeneration can betriggered dependent on effluent quality, makes IEX less sensitiveto low temperature and diurnal shock loads, compared withbiological processes. In relation to energy consumption, aerationconsumed the majority of total electricity needs, representing53%, followed 38% by drum filter (Fig. 2). The HFMC was able toclean-up the KCl brine and by adding sulphuric acid, ammoniumsulphate (NH4)2SO4 was recovered with annual production of 98tonnes. The cloth filter was capable of cleaning up NaOH brineand by adding hydrated lime, hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3(OH) wasrecovered with annual production of 3.4 tonnes.The UASB-configured AnMBR provided suitable treatment(Fig. 1). The optimised intermittent dead-end biogas spargingregime resulted in low energy demands and low operationalcosts17. The COD removal efficiency in the AnMBR was 87%, butthe further 6% removal, to reach the required 93% in total, couldbe supplemented by IEX, as HAIX media was found capable ofremoving COD by 40–50%9. The specific energy consumptionclearly showed the benefits of biogas production as most of theenergy consumed was offset by production in the AnMBR with atotal energy production of 0.12 kWh/m3 (does not consider theother processes consumption) (Fig. 2).Overall, the IEX processes were more reliable to meet low levelor even very low level of nutrients discharge limits compared withBNR. Importantly, nutrient recovery could be achieved duringregenerant cleaning up, allowing for >85% nutrient recovery(Tables 7 and 8). Furthermore, IEX processes are generallyindependent of temperature, resilient to shock loads andconsumes relatively low electricity6,8,9. However, high concentra-tion of suspended solids and competing ions (SO42−, Ca2+, NO3−etc.) in the feed can potentially reduce performance efficiency8.Column experiments indicated that adsorption capacity wasreduced by up to 50% when high level suspended solids werepresented6. To minimise the impacts of suspended solids on theprocess performance, pre-treatment with filtration, or similar, isnormally required. This increases processes complexity and costs.AnMBR coupling with IEX have more benefits compared with ASP+ IEX. Besides energy recovery, a crucial point is that AnMBRprovides solid free effluent feeding into IEX, which improveadsorption efficiency, secure stability of IEX process. The influenceof SO4 in the influent at the level of 50 mg/L to IEX was consideredto be limited9. A test with synthetic solution showed that SO4reduced the capacity of HAIX from 114mg P/g to 101mg P/g9 (atinitial P and SO4 concentrations 100mg/L) but this reduction incapacity did not continue when the sulphate concentration was>100mg/L. This was linked with the sulphate competing for bothsorption sites and ferric nanoparticles embedded in HAIXstructure18. Presence of high concentration of SO4 (>100 mg/L)may impact the AnMBR process operation and methane yieldthrough the carbon utilisation by sulphate reducing bacteria, butthe effect can be mitigated by precipitation of sulphate saltproduced from added chemical (Fe2+) and optimising solidretention time and specific gas demands19. On the other side,Fe2+ needs to be balanced with other potential negative impactsdownstream, including loss of recoverable phosphate in the IEXregenerant as well as adding potential further competing ionsreducing capacity, specifically for the cation IEX process.Economic evaluationThe CAPEX estimated for the BNR+ iron dosing process was£3.94 M (Fig. 3). The largest contribution to the CAPEX was theconstruction of the BNR concrete tanks accounting for 60%,followed by 17% for tertiary filter, and 15% for installation ofaeration systems (Fig. 3). The total operational expenditure (OPEX)was estimated to be £316 k/year. The maintenance costsconstituted the majority of the total OPEX, representing 31%.Sludge and labour costs make up 25% and 17% of the annualOPEX, followed by 17% for energy consumption (Fig. 3). Totalwhole life cost (WLC) was estimated at £8.4 M.The CAPEX estimated for the ASP+ IEX process was £3.48(Fig. 3). Installation of IEX (Fig. 3) accounted for the majority oftotal CAPEX representing 44%, followed by 33% for constructionof conventional ASP concrete tanks. Total OPEX was estimated at£282k/year. Operation of ASP accounted for 79% of total OPEX,including electricity consumption for aeration, sludge disposal,X. Huang et al.2npj Clean Water (2020)     7 Published in partnership with King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals1234567890():,;and related maintenance costs (Fig. 3). The WLC was estimated at£7.4 M.The CAPEX estimated for the AnMBR+IEX process was £3.6 M.The purchase of membrane and construction of UASB reactoraccounted for the majority of total CAPEX (Fig. 2). The total OPEXwas estimated to be £177k/year accounting with the energyconsumption of biogas sparging and recirculation pumps (Fig. 3).The WLC was estimated at £6.1 M.Comparing the three flowsheets, Fig. 4 shows costs by year asTOTEX, by process and costs by process combination in thedesigned business scenario. Comparatively, IEX consumed muchless electricity. More importantly, regenerant clean-up and reusesubstantially lowered down the costs compared with whichregenerant was used only once. For N IEX column, reuse ofregenerant reduced the total OPEX by 50%, and recoverydecreased further 15–65% in comparison with using newFig. 1 Designed processes, mass and energy balances. a BNR (A2O) with iron dosing and tertiary filtration; b ASP+ IEX with clean-up andreuse of regenerant; and c AnMBR+ IEX with clean-up and reuse of regenerant.X. Huang et al.3Published in partnership with King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals npj Clean Water (2020)     7 regenerant every time. For P IEX column, HAIX media costs wereexpected to be 30–50% lower when using local products forscaled up treatment units. The results also indicated that WLC ofASP+ IEX and AnMBR+ IEX are 10.5% and 19.8% less than that ofBNR+ iron dosing, respectively.When very high removal efficiency is required, such as >95% oreven >98%, the costs of biological processes are dramaticallyincreased. An estimation revealed that the operational costs weredoubled to reach effluent discharge from <1mg P/L to 0.1 mg P/L20. Instead, IEX OPEX is less sensitive to stringent nutrientdischarge control compared with BNR, especially if the regener-ants can be managed in such a way that allow for multiple useand recovery, as here described. Studies also illustrated theoperational preference of having high capacity over highdurability. For example, when mesolite capacity had a fourfoldFig. 2 Specific energy consumption for the designed processes.Fig. 3 Processes CAPEX breakdown by segments and processes OPEX breakdown by classification for a BNR (A2O) with iron dosing andtertiary filtration; b conventional ASP+ IEX with clean-up and reuse of regenerant; and c AnMBR+ IEX with clean-up and reuse of regenerant.X. Huang et al.4npj Clean Water (2020)     7 Published in partnership with King Fahd University of Petroleum & Mineralsincrease, the yearly OPEX was reduced by ~50%. However, whenmedia life had been prolonged 10 times, the yearly OPEX wasreduced by only 10%6.Direct greenhouse emissionsBiological treatment processes release CO2 from the oxidation oforganic matter, nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitrification/denitrifica-tion and methane (CH4) from anaerobic methanogenesis, whichcontributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions21. Energyconsumptions from grid or combined heat and power lead toindirect GHG emission. The estimated GHG emissions for thestudied processes BNR+ iron dosing, ASP+ IEX and AnMBR+ IEXwere 936 CO2eq t/y, 507 CO2eq t/y and 171 CO2eq t/y, respectively,based on the factors described in Table 1 and assuming emissionsfrom other fugitive emissions, such as methane, to be 5%22.Compared with BNR, ASP has less GHG emissions owing tolower electricity consumption and no evident N2O release as thereis no nitrification and denitrification reactions. Meanwhile, AnMBRachieved minimal environmental impact because of nearlycomplete biogas recovery and significant reduction in the energyconsumption. IEX consumes very low electricity, with no evidentdirect GHG emission in the process. The recovered nutrients fromthe brine also offer a route for resources recycling. IEX couplingwith AnMBR considerably reduces direct greenhouse emissionsand is aligned with circular economy for sustainable developmentthrough both energy and nutrients recovery.DISCUSSIONIEX processes provide a route to capture the nutrients fromwastewater into concentrated brine and offered the possibility forsubsequent nutrients extraction processes. “Resources factory” hasbecome a buzzword in recent decades for describing how WWTPsshould be designed and operated in the near future. This notionaims at more sustainable pattern for development by maximisingrecovery, reuse and recycling. A review analysed liquid, gas andsolid nitrogen recovery with all the state of art technologies andcompared the costs with that of industrial nitrogen synthesis fromair23. The result indicated that N recovery from wastewater isneither currently economical nor urgently needed. It is estimatedthat the costs of IEX-based approach is relatively low at £1.98 ±0.23/kg N in the case of NH4NO3 recovery23 compared with otherprocesses, and the operational costs of (NH4)2SO4 recovery in thisstudy was around £2.35/kg NH4-N, but it still cannot compete withindustrial synthesis approach (£0.28/kg N). A recommendedrecovery method with minimal technical input is for agriculturalirrigation or selling it as liquid or aqua ammonia fertiliser.Notwithstanding, there is a valid argument if consideringindustrial nitrogen synthesis process (Haber–Bosch approach)consume 1–2% of global power production and emit 4–8 tons ofCO2 per ton of fertiliser produced24. Although nitrogen onlyrecovery process is feasible, they are not extensively implementedso far11. This may change in the future with less availability andrising costs of natural gas that industrial process uses.On the other side, phosphorus is non-renewable element minedfrom rock phosphate, and ultimately flows into oceans after usage.Considering the limited reserves of rock phosphate, unevendistribution in different countries and increased prices in recentyears25, phosphorus recovery from wastewater becomes increas-ingly imperative as wastewater is one of the richest sources ofphosphorus containing 250,000 tons per year, averagely25.Furthermore, the form of recovered phosphorus can be selectedbased on maturity of the extractive technology, cost of theprocess and resale value of the product. For example, vivianite isrecommended as it has highest value and added iron cansimultaneously improve the process performance26. In the studiedscenario, the recovered nutrients products were ammoniasulphate and hydroxyapatite and their properties are describedin Table 2.The marketability of the recovered nutrient products dependson product purity and quality, legislation, application industry,Fig. 4 Costs comparison for the three processes investigated. aTotal expenditure (TOTEX) over the 40 years period; b totalexpenditure per process; and c whole life costs for the threeflowsheets.Table 1.

Huang et al.5Published in partnership with King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals npj Clean Water (2020)     7 entry points, comparable exiting product sale price and the otheraspects. A study using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopyanalysis suggested high purity of the recovered ammonia sulphateby HFMC from spent regenerant, with only N, O and S elementsdetected and in proportion close to ideal products27. Studies alsosuggested superior purity of the recovered hydroxyapatitecompared with alternative sources or other recovered phosphorusproducts28.To make the recovered nutrient a marketable product,consistent quality of the recovered nutrients must be reached,such as solid content >95%, dust <1% by weight, 2–3mm of sizefor agricultural products, 1–1.25mm of granular size for golfcourse turf11. Specifications for product to enter a specific marketmust be met. As fertiliser, the products should have no pathogenor heavy metals, and nutrient content and release rate must reachrequired level. It is to note that recovered nutrient products fromwastewater as fertiliser will not likely be able to be marketed with“certified organic”. There are potentially four entry points forrecovered nutrients products as fertiliser11. The recoveredproducts can be sold directly to end-user, wholesaler, brokerand dealer or through wholesaler, broker and dealer network toend-user.The fertiliser market is the focus for the recovered ammoniasulphate and hydroxyapatite. However, there are also alternativeuses in other industries. The prices of commercial ammoniasulphate, calcium phosphate and hydroxyapatite products on themarkets as fertiliser and chemical were shown in Table 3.The prices vary widely because of different quality and purity indifferent grade, such as fertiliser grade, food grade, or pharma-ceutical grade. Unless the recovered products resale price is at thesame level with these comparable existing products, it is hard togain the markets. If all the recovered products are sold as fertiliser,the revenue is only £12,834/year, representing 13.2% of annual IEXOPEX, i.e., after drying the HAP or further concentrate the N-liquid.But if all the recovered products, particularly hydroxyapatite, aresold as chemical used for health care, the annual revenue can be£450,285/year, representing fourfold annual IEX OPEX, becausethe unit price of hydroxyapatite as agent is ~400 times of calciumphosphate used as fertiliser (Table 4). However, consideringpotential risk and social acceptance, it is still currently impractic-able to enter into food and pharmaceutical markets for therecovered products from wastewater.In conclusion, the ion-exchange processes using mesolite andHAIX present high adsorption capacity for ammonia andphosphorus removal as secondary and tertiary stage of municipalwastewater treatment. Furthermore, nutrients can be recoveredfrom the regenerants and these can be re-used multiple times.Compared with BNR, the benefits of ion-exchange processesinclude technical reliability, low costs, low GHG emission.Furthermore, nutrient recovery illustrated that IEX is an attractivealternative for nutrient removal and recovery from municipalwastewater, when compared with BNR. Especially, the coupling ofAnMBR and ion-exchange processes allows for both energy andnutrient recovery, which is aligned with the circular economyvision.The ion-exchange processes can be applied to small size ormiddle scale municipal wastewater plants when very qualityeffluent is required. For application in large WWTPs, the ionexchange columns can be divided into small units, allowing forsimple operation. Overall, IEX processes are attractive for nutrientremoval and recovery from municipal wastewater.Table 2.

The flow assumed was three dry weather flow(DWF, i.e., the wastewater flow in a sewer system during periods of dryweather with minimum infiltration) at 540 L/(PE.day) corresponding to5400m3/d.Anaerobic-Anoxic-Oxic (A2O) process was selected as typical BNR owingto its simplicity and widespread application, and it was designed based onthe “sludge retention time (SRT)” method14. The influent was assessed tobe suitable for using A2O process and the design was based on thecomputation approach described in the Supplemental information S1. Theprocess was assumed under typical UK conditions with an averagewastewater temperature of 14 °C. The key parameter designs aresummarised Supplemental information S1.The combined ASP+ IEX flowsheet considered a conventional ASPtargeted at BOD removal and it was designed based on the “SRT”method14. The key parameter designs are summarised in Supplementalinformation S1. To further remove suspended solids from the ASP effluent,and avoid frequent clogging of IEX bed, high head losses, and inefficientoperation owing to resin binding caused by residual organics associatedwith suspended solids, a drum filter was designed with loading capacity of4500 L/m2 h (key parameters designs were summarised in Supplementalinformation S1).The IEX processes design consisted of two columns, regeneration units,clean-up and nutrient recovery systems for ammonia and phosphorus,respectively9,29. The design was based on the computation approachdescribed in Table 6 and design parameters are summarised in Tables 7and 8.In the AnMBR process, biogas sparging is crucial to control membranefouling. However, this consumes significant amounts of the energy, whichnormally accounts for two-third of the total energy demands of AnMBRprocess. The design was optimised by utilising intermittent regime andinnovative gas sparging devices, so that energy demand of dead-end gassparging could reach as low as 0.13 kWh per m3 permeate, whereasspecific gas demand can be reached as low as 0.5 m3/m2 h with sustainedmembrane permeability17.This significantly reduced capital costs because of obviation of blowerpurchase and less membrane area invested, as well as operational costsowing to less energy consumed17. Data from a 3-year’s run AnMBR processfor treatment of municipal wastewater at an average temperature of 14 °Csupported the feasibility of the designed AnMBR. To recover dissolvedmethane in AnMBR effluent, a degassing membrane contactor wasdesigned. A study showed that it was effective by a highest recordedrecovery of dissolved methane from AnMBR effluent was up to 95%30. Thismakes possible to turn nearly all the methane produced into energy/electricity. The case illustrated that COD removal rate could maintain at87 ± 1% and methane yield between 0.18 and 0.23 Nm3 CH4/kg CODremovedand membrane flux at 10–13 L/m2 31.

Each major equipment component of the process was listedand calculated individually based on the designed specifications, andwhole CAPEX was subsequently obtained by multiplying a Lang factor of4.74 to the sum of the major purchased equipment items (Eq. 5).C ¼ FXCe (5)Where, C is total plant ISBL (inside battery limits) capital cost, ∑Ce is thetotal delivered cost of all the major equipment items and F is 4.74, an Langfactor for fluids processing plant32.OPEXBased on unit price and quantities of the items in the process, OPEX wascalculated as the sum of: i) energy costs; ii); chemical costs; iii) sludgetreatment or disposal costs; iv) maintenance costs (assumed as 2.5% ofCAPEX)32; and v) labour costs.WLC calculationThe WLC consists of the initial CAPEX and sum of the OPEX for the life spanof the process. The life span was assumed as 40 years, and the presentvalue conversion of the OPEX in the future years were performed at thediscount rate of 7%, which could be estimated by Eq. 66.WLC whole life costð Þ ¼ Initial CAPEX þ Annual OPEX ´ 14ð Þ (6)DATA AVAILABILITYData can be made available upon request.Received: 6 May 2019; Accepted: 12 February 2020;REFERENCES1.
