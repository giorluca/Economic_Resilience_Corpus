Bank XYZ’s net profit in 2020 decreased by 45.75 percent compared to the previous year. The decline in Bank XYZ’s performance during the covid-19 pandemic forced the company to continue to review the right strategy to improve the company’s performance from various aspects, one of which was human resources. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the government issued a regulation for the implementation of a work from home system, but this did not apply to employees working in the banking sector. Banking employees have to work every day, haunted by fear of contracting the Covid-19 virus, fear of family health conditions at home, threats of layoffs, and others. In addition, every company must immediately accelerate the implementation of digital transformation, evaluate employee work systems, and provide trainings that can support work. Employees like it or not, must quickly adapt to the conditions of the work environment, upgrade their skills in order to continue to maintain employee performance. The ability of resilience as an employee strategy to survive in working conditions during a covid-19 need to be improved.One of the strategies implemented by Bank XYZ is to experiment with the implementation of Universal Banker on frontliner employees in several Work Units in Jakarta. The next target is the implementation at the Makassar Regional Office. However, in terms of service, the results of a third-party survey appointed by the head office, the Makassar Regional Office’s service excellence value is still ranked 14th out of 18 Regional Offices, with a percentage of 76.31 percent. Complaint data in 2020, it was recorded that the Makassar Regional Office received the highest number of complaints than other regional offices. Most of the complaints came from the service process, employee attitudes, and loan administration (Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office 2021).According to Katadata (2021), the performances of major national banks have been affected by Covid-19. The profits of several banks such as BCA, BRI, Bank Mandiri, and BNI recorded a decline during 2019-2020. Bank BCA, Bank Mandiri, and BNI experienced a decline of 5.2 percent, 37.8 percent, and 78.6 percent, respectively. Nadeem et al. (2019) stated that globalization and intense competition require organizations to adopt new strategies to improve organizational performance internally. As stated by Hu et al. (2021), in responding to the pandemic, banking institutions must transform to develop and implement their plans to reform the operational structure and practices of the company, to be specific through banking workforce adaptation, focus on customers as the core of the business, employee performance optimization beyond ordinary tasks, and employee capability enhancement.The COVID-19 pandemic has not only affected business turnover and decreased company performance, but also affected employees. Employees are required to be able to go along with business developments and work even harder. Due to the pandemic, employees need resilience to deal with these issues. Ojo et al. (2021) stated the COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainties and a significant burden on employees. Amid a crisis like this, the corporate is crucial for business continuity and recovery. Resilience is a concept from the positive psychology literature which highlights the ability of organizations and individuals to cope with unexpected situations. Resilience enables people to navigate stressful workplaces and unforeseen circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic.According to Jiang et al. (2012), the implementation of HPWS is believed to help companies improve organizational performance through employee performance. Employees must be resilient in the event of a pandemic. Employee resilience has positively and significantly affected the performance of banking employees in Surabaya (Paramananda and Kistyanto, 2021). The literature study findings show that the performance of frontline employees is influenced by the implementation of the high-performance work system (HPWS). The studies on the influence of HPWS on employee performance have been carried out in several countries including Malaysia (Husin and Gugkang, 2017), Pakistan (Nadeem et al. 2019), China (Cooper et al. 2019), and Bangladesh (Wahid and Hyams-Ssekasi, 2018). The results of these studies show that HPWS has a positive impact on employee performance in the service industry.Bardoel et al. (2014) stated that there is a positive relation between HR management practices and employee resilience. A range of HR management practices can increase resilience. Kerdpitak and Jermsittiparsert (2020) argued that the practice of Human Resources (HR) management is an important aspect of an Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 201738P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023to motivate employees to work optimally and become a competitive advantage for the company. Based on the description of the problem statement above, the purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of high-performance work system (HPWS) on employee resilience and service performance. In addition, to determine the best strategy for improving resilience and service performance of banking employees.METHODSThe data were collected at Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office, Indonesia. Makassar Regional Office consists of 35 branch offices of Bank XYZ. A total of 336 respondents in the survey were employees who worked in the service sector. This study applied a quantitative approach. The data used in this study consisted of primary data and secondary data. The results of an online survey of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office frontline personnel utilizing an e-questionnaire via online media provided primary data. The sample was obtained from employment data of the frontline service unit in Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office, which consisted of Customer Service, Teller, and Security. The sampling method in this study is purposive sampling. There are both open-ended and closed-ended questions in the questionnaire. Closed-ended questions include those about the High-Performance Work System (HPWS), Employee Resilience (ER), and Employee Service Performance (ESP). The determination of strategies to improve employee resilience and service performance in a company during a pandemic and post-pandemic, particularly for intermediary institutions, will be updated from prior studies. The study used an analytical method of SEM-PLS to determine the effect between variables. The study results will be supported by descriptive data in order to identify any gaps that occurred at Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office. The following hypotheses will be tested in this study based on the findings of prior studies:H1:  High-performance Work System (HPWS) has a positive and significant influence on employee resilienceH2:    Employee resilience has a positive and significant influence on employee service performanceH3:   High-performance Work System (HPWS) has a positive and significant influence on employee service performanceorganization. HR assists companies in performing their functions efficiently and these practices are extensively focused on employees, who are the most important and significant determinant of organizational performance (Jermsittiparsert et al. 2019). HPWS can be defined as a system that creates an environment within the business that enables greater employee participation and responsibility. Employees are viewed as valuable business partners that assist the company to achieve and maintain a competitive edge through their dedication to the company’s success. Dorta-Afonso et al. (2021) tested HPWS on employee welfare and job performance in the hospitality sector. The effect of relationships between variables was determined using the SEM-PLS method. HPWS directly affects employee motivation, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and quality of life.The study results of Cooke et al. (2016) show that the high-performance work system (HPWS) has a positive impact on employee resilience. Nadeem et al. (2019) designed a study to see how high-performance work system (HPWS) affects employee resilience, which is a variable that connects employee service performance and corporate citizenship behavior (OCB). According to the results, HPWS increases employee service performance. Employee resilience as a mediator variable demonstrates HPWS direct and indirect influence on employee service performance. Hanafi and Ibrahim (2018) conducted a study on the impact of employee skills on service performance. The three dimensions of employee service performance are perceived comfort, complaint resolution, and customer service.Bustinza et al. (2019) stated that HR practices develop employee resilience, which is beneficial to businesses in terms of adapting to change and eventually enhancing organizational effectiveness. Khan et al. (2017) through a study on HR practices in telecommunication companies in Pakistan found that employee resilience can be enhanced through HR practices such as information exchange, job design, employee development opportunities, and employee benefits. Al-Omar et al. (2019) studied the impact of perceived organizational support and resilience on the involvement of pharmacists in the stressful and competitive workplace in Saudi Arabia.High-performance Work System (HPWS) is used by companies as an approach to HR management practices Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 2017 39P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023Referring to Block (1993), there are 7 (seven) indicators used to describe the HPWS variable. The employee resilience variable in the questionnaire was using BRS-6, according to Smith et al. (2008). The employee service performance variable consists of 3 (three) indicators, referring to Hanafi and Ibrahim (2018). Furthermore, all indicators will be used as a reference for questionnaire questions. Open-ended questions do not have any choice of answers and are instead based on the conditions experienced by the respondent. Open-ended questions are required to deepen the discussion of findings. The e-questionnaire applied a Likert scale.  Based on the background, research problem formulation, and the results of previous research literature studies, there are several strategies to improve the resilience and service performance of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office employees. This study will examine the effect of the High-performance Work System (HPWS) variable on employee resilience and employee service performance. The framework of thought as an overview of the conceptual framework of this research can be seen in Figure 1.Figure 1. Research framework Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 201740P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023were permanent employees. A total of 46.13 percent of respondents have worked for less than three years, while others have worked for 3-6 years (16.67 percent), 6-9 years (15.18 percent), and more than nine years (22.02 percent). The survey results on the distribution of respondents to work obstacles are summarized in Table 2.The results of the open-ended questions are mapped in Table 2. Grouping is based on the answers of the respondents. Even though the survey results indicate that 52.38 percent of respondents did not have difficulties in work, 47.62 percent of other respondents admitted to having obstacles in their work. Therefore, all aspects must be considered in the strategy to improve employee service performance. About 12.20 percent of respondents had problems with customer complaints. The frontline employees have experienced difficulties in understanding customer complaints and the local languages spoken by customers. Customers of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office generally live in rural areas and speak different native languages. Customers oftentimes did not want to use Indonesian when making complaints to the Bank. Frontline employees of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office are not only locals but those from various regions in Indonesia. In addition, several respondents stated that they still need training on product knowledge (3,870 percent) and how to handle customer complaints so that the service can be quicker and more satisfying. In terms of working hours, 14.29 respondents found it difficult to divide their working hours with the workload assigned by the office, as indicated in Table 2. To boost the speed and accuracy of service, respondents needed a team or additional frontline employees. Several respondents said they had to travel a significant distance to get to the branch office. The work environment and limited facilities were the most significant obstacles (17.26 percent). Sujiati et al. (2017) stated, motivation and competence affect employee performance. An alternative strategy for improving employee performance at the Satellite Technology Center - LAPAN is to increase employee training and development as a top priority. Yuen et al. (2018) argued employees will be more satisfied and motivated if they are given better working conditions and it will increase their performance.This study applied the simple random sampling method. The sample size was determined using the Slovin formula with a 95% confidence level (significance level) and a 5% margin of error. Based on the calculation results of sample size with the Slovin formula, it required 336 samples from a total population of 2,110 frontline employees. Descriptive analysis was executed by calculating the percentage of the data obtained from each variable. Descriptive analysis in this study covers the characteristics of respondents such as age, gender, employment status, the most recent education, and length of employment. The interconnection between variables was tested using Structural Equation Modeling Analysis Partial Least Square (SEM PLS). The definition of operational variables in this study is presented in Table 1.RESULTSThe study included 336 respondents, consisting of frontline employees of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office i.e. Customer Service, Teller, and Security. Men dominate the gender distribution of responders or 56.25 percent. Beresford Research (2022) classified generations based on their birth year and age. Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, ranges in age from 10 to 25 years. Millennials were born between 1981 and 1996 and range in age from 26 to 41 years, while Boomers are those over 42 years old. According to the classification by Beresford Research (2022), most respondents are Millennials, which is 57.45 percent. Gen Z has the second-highest percentage or 33.63 percent. Meanwhile, the Boomers are only 8.92 percent of the total respondents.The number of respondents who were not married and those who were married was not dramatically different, according to the survey data. Most respondents (32.04 percent) had at least a high school diploma and the majority had a bachelor’s degree (62.87 percent). The respondent’s most recent educational profile corresponds to his or her present employment status.Respondents with FL Internship employment status (38.10 percent) must have had a minimum diploma equivalent to high school as their most recent education. FL Apprentice, Outsourcing, and Contract personnel were the most common employment statuses in the frontline division of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office. Only 3.27 percent of respondents Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 2017 41P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023Table 1.

Respondents in several branch offices felt that their colleagues within the same division could not be cooperative and supportive. The limited facilities include network constraints and less supportive office facilities in several branch offices such as old computers, and out-of-date windows systems, the respondents oftentimes found network errors when they were providing services to customers. Table 3 describes the distribution of respondents according to their responses on training suitability. Table 3 shows the results of answers to open-ended questions on the suitability of the training which are not mandatory to answer. Therefore, some respondents did not answer the question. The results are depicted to help the author in strengthening the discussion.The mapping results indicate that 56.85 percent of respondents stated that the pieces of training provided by the office were suitable. In contrast, 22.62 percent of respondents admitted that the training provided were not suitable. Some answers stated that this unsuitability was caused by some reasons: the training was conducted during service hours, and the respondents who worked in several branch offices but did not receive training were directly assigned to the field. It is because branch offices needed the new employees to assist with work in the field. The training on product knowledge was required, especially in XYZ Bank digital services, public speaking training, and how to handle customer complaints.Data processing results of the respondent distribution convey that the training provided by Bank XYZ and its Makassar Regional Office has been tailored to the needs of the respondents. The company has designed the best possible in providing training for frontline employees. The unsuitable training hours became an obstacle for several respondents. About 46 percent of frontline employees were new employees. Respondents in this category were recruited to suit the needs of Human Resources (HR) in the field, where most frontline employees who passed the test as mantri or marketers will be hired immediately. Due to the strong demand for employees at the branch offices because of the vacant positions, the new employees have not always had the opportunity to get training. Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office needs to pay attention to and redesign HR planning (manpower planning) and Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 201742P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023constructs and other latent constructs is explained in the inner model through the bootstrapping process and T-statistical test parameters. Figure 2 describes the results of the SEM PLS model. Outer Model EvaluationContribution of IndicatorsAccording to Cheah et al. (2018), the assessment of the outer model can be conducted through three criteria, i.e. the values  of convergent validity, discriminant validity, and composite reliability. A correlation meets convergent validity if its loading value is > 0.5. Hair et al. (2017) set 0.5 as the limit of the validity test in SEM. The indicator validity test on the latent variable was conducted three times. It is to ensure that all indicators in all latent variables in the study match the validity requirements, as evidenced by a loading factor value greater than 0.05. The results of the indicator validity test on the latent variable of HPWS (X) demonstrate that three indicators had to be excluded in the first experiment because their loading factor value is less than 0.05: X1b (0.329), X2b (0.379), and X2d (0.224). In addition to these three indicators, other indicators were able to represent the HPWS variable well until the second experiment because it has a loading factor value of > 0.05. Therefore, the SEM analysis process for the HPWS latent variable is represented by other indicators after the three indicators above were removed from the analysis. The results of the indicator validity test on Employee Resilience (Y1) and the Employee Service Performance (Y2) after two experiments show that all indicators can explain the latent variables of Employee Resilience and Employee Service Performance because they have a loading factor value of > 0.50. Thus, all these indicators represent the two variables in the SEM analysis process.Figure 2 shows that the indicators of sharing knowledge, training by commitment, and reduced status barriers have an impact on more than 80% of the HPWS variable. This demonstrates that the organization may concentrate its evaluation on these three indicators to improve HPWS. Respondents who are dominated by Gen Z and Millennials demanded that job-related information be disclosed and that work results be appreciated. Respondents also wanted training to take place outside of operational hours so that the advantages of the training are absorbed and beneficial for employees. Furthermore, HPWS can improve if employees work in an environment that fosters mutual frontline employee workflow because if this continues, the company will face a boomerang effect. As Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2019) stated, managers should try to find a balanced workload for their employees to maximize employee performance. Both too high and too low workloads lead to a decrease in quantitative performance. An established HR control system can help in balancing the workload. Workload management necessitates meticulous workflow planning as well as technological innovations that allow employees to handle enormous volumes of time-sensitive tasks. According to Inegbedion et al. (2020), when employees are uncomfortable at work, their resilience weakens, and instead of delivering results, they devote more of their efforts to dealing with stress caused by discomfort. The results of a study by Hidayat and Situmorang (2019) showed that the external workload affects employee performance. The external workloads are burdens that come from outside the worker’s body, such as working space layout and conditions, work complexity, responsibilities, division of labor, and working environment conditions. Meanwhile, internal factors do not directly affect employee performance. Employee performance is influenced by both external and internal workloads at the same time. According to Kelly (2016), there is a significant effect on differences in gender and age of employees on attitudes and High-Performance Work Systems (HPWS) implemented by the company. The findings of the study demonstrate that the variations in age groups can be explained by the millennial generation’s entry into the workforce and how the company must consider their attitude and requirements. The age diversification of employees in the organization will improve the performance of the employee’s organization. Model of HPWS Influence on Employee Resilience and Service PerformanceHypothesis testing in this study used the Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS) method. Hypothesis analysis was conducted to determine the influence of HPWS on employee resilience and service performance. The SEM testing process was conducted with two (2) sets of equations, i.e. the outer model and the inner model. The outer model displays the relationship between the latent construct and the indicators by assessing validity and reliability. The relationship between latent Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 2017 43P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023leadership. At the same time, managers’ behavior should be supportive and give employees the impression that indeed they are valuable members of the organizationThe indicators of customer service and complaint resolution indications > 90% explain the variable of Employee Service Performance, as shown in Figure 2. This shows that by evaluating and improving these two indicators, Employee Service Performance may be improved. The competence of employees in understanding and resolving customer complaints must be improved through related training. In addition, product knowledge training or refreshment time must be held frequently so that employees can present and offer Bank XYZ products competently. According to Cesário and Chambel (2017), there is a positive relationship between competence and individual performance. Companies must periodically adjust employee competencies, which are closely related to important resources for change. The results of a study conducted by Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2019) indicated that employee performance is included in the high category. Employee performance improves in direct proportion to their level of training. Coaching employees will improve their performance. Athar and Shah (2015) argued that banks that provide proper training to their employees can see significant increases in performance and production, as well as higher customer satisfaction. Average Variance Extracted (AVE)The second test for convergent validity was conducted by analyzing the Average Variance Extracted (AVE) value on the reflective indicator model. The model has good validity if each latent variable with reflective indicators has an AVE above 0.5. The results of the analysis presented in Table 4 below show that the AVE value of each latent variable has a value > 0.5 and the PLS model can be stated to meet the criteria for good convergent validity.Composite ReliabilityThe reliability testing of the model was used to prove the accuracy, consistency, and precision of the instrument in measuring the construct. Hair et al. (2017) explained that composite reliability output can be used to assess reliability, with the requirement that the value is greater than 0.7. The reliability test that measures composite reliability and Cronbach’s Alpha on latent variables respect, a supportive team, and employee participation in problem-solving. The loading factor value on the resilience variable (Figure 2) shows that indicators can explain the resilience variable of > 70 percent and the remainder is explained by other indicators not included in the study, such as organizational resilience. Respondents’ overall resilience was between medium and high. As stated by Luthan et al. (2006), there is a substantial clinical study that has determined that both external (contextual) and internal (psychological) characteristics affect a person’s capacity to have resilience. Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office must evaluate work programs and give attention to specific needs of employees, such as enhancing employee competency and creating a supportive work environment, as a strategy to maintain employee resilience. Although this study does not address organizational resilience, it is crucial to discuss it since organizational resilience has a positive impact on individual resilience. Resilience, according to Cooke et al. (2016), is created from daily habits through normative control rather than rare and special individual qualities.Weibel et al. (2016) defined normative control as the existence of formal and informal consequences for violations of organizational norms, ethics, and values. Companies with Asian cultures have varying normative controls. Sharing common values helps in building trust among organizational members, facilitates social bonding, and clarifies “how employees do work,” while sanctions that follow deviations from these norms increase trust in the organization as a whole and further contribute to organizational performance. According to Andersson et al. (2019), decentralized decision making, usage of information systems, comprehension of organizational philosophy, and explanation of HR management processes in the company are examples of what companies may do with a decentralized structure. Jauhari et al. (2017) stated that companies that distribute decision-making throughout the organization and empower employees to provide excellent customer service achieve optimal organizational results. According to Diamantidis and Chatzoglou (2019), leadership is a key factor in developing a great organization. The practice of encouraging individual and collective efforts to achieve common goals is the essence of organizational Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 201744P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023(Y2) of 0.570. This value indicates that 65.9 percent of the variability of the Employee Resilience variable can be explained by variables in the model and the remaining 34.1 percent of the variance is explained by variables outside the model. About 57 percent of the variability of the Employee Service Performance variable can be explained by the variables in the model and the remaining 43 percent of the variance is explained by the variables outside the model.According to Chin (1998), the value of R square is divided into 3 (three) groups, very weak (<0.19), weak (0.19-0.33), moderate (0.33-0.67), and high (>0.67). Based on this grouping, it can be stated that the R-square value of all endogenous variables in this model is in the moderate group. The next inner model evaluation was carried out by bootstrapping the outer model and using the p-value and the original value as a reference for testing the hypothesis on each path from exogenous variables to endogenous variables. Hair et al. (2019) stated that the original value explains the impact or direction of the relationship between variables. The original value can be defined as the correlation value between variables. The T-statistical value represented by the p-value is a value that describes the strong (significant) or weak (insignificant) relationship between variables. Bootstrapping results in Table 6 indicate that all the relationships formed are significant since they have a p-value <0.05. In addition, the original value of this model shows that all relationships formed have a positive influence (directly related). The Influence of HPWS (X) on Employee Resilience (Y1)Hypothesis 1 (H1) examines the effect of the HPWS variable (X) on Employee Resilience (Y1). The test results show that the p-value is 0.00 and the original value (estimated coefficient) is positive at 0.812. It can be stated that HPWS has a significant influence on Employee Resilience with an inline relationship. In general, it can be described that the increase of HPWS by 1 percent will boost Resilience by 81.2 percent.HPWS has a positive and significant influence on employee resilience (Table 6). This indicates that HPWS practices contribute to the development of individual resilience which can further improve employee and organizational service performance. In that have reflective indicators is stated to be reliable if it has a value of more than 0.6. The findings of the study, as shown in Table 4, reveal that all latent variables have good, accurate, and consistent reliability since they meet the requirements, with composite reliability results of more than 0.7 and indicate that the model is reliable.Discriminant Validity (Cross Loading Factor)Discriminant validity, according to Cheah et al. (2018), is an additional validity test that demonstrates how well an indicator differentiates between variables. If the correlation of the latent variable with the indicator is bigger than the other latent variables, discriminant validity is good. The test is carried out on the principle that the different constructs (manifest variables) should not be highly correlated. The results show that the cross-loading value of all indicators has a greater value in the original construct compared to the other constructs. For example, the X1a indicator has a cross-loading value of its latent variable X of 0.353, while the X1a indicator on Y1 is 0.286 and Y2 is 0.290. The value of cross-loading X1a2 on its latent variable, X, has the highest value compared to the value of cross loading X1a, there are latent variables Y1 and Y2. Thus, it can be stated that the indicator X1a is valid. All remaining indicators are valid and feasible to proceed in the next analysis.The whole process of evaluating the outer model in this study has indicated that all the criteria must be fulfilled so that a model can be stated to be valid and reliable. These criteria include Loading Factor, Average Variance Extracted (AVE), Composite Reliability, and Cross Loading (Hamid et al. 2017). Based on the evaluation results of the outer model, it can be stated that the measurement model in this study has fulfilled the four criteria. It means that the model is valid and reliable, and the test can proceed to the inner model evaluation stage.Inner Model EvaluationThe inner model evaluation began with an analysis of the R-square value. R-square is a coefficient that shows the strength of a latent variable in influencing other latent variables that become endogenous variables. Table 5 describes that Employee Resilience (Y1) has an R-square of 0.659 and Employee Service Performance Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 2017 45P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023work stress because of the increased workload, which may lower the employee service performance in the long run. The Makassar Regional Office management must ensure that all employees receive the same information, have clear targets, perform in a healthy and mutually supportive environment, and understand the impact of their job on the company and communities. Liu et al. (2021) argued that companies must establish organizational resilience. Corporate resilience does not develop instantly, it takes time and long-term strategic design, detailed plans, and effective measures. Resilience can help organizations respond to and adapt to crises, thereby influencing their response time. Building interpersonal communication amongst employees within a division is critical in HR management practice so that employees can complement each other’s strengths. In the event of a crisis, good communication among members allows them to shift strategies and handle problems in real-time. Good communication helps to create an atmosphere of information sharing in the workplace, and to allow for reciprocal improvement through mutual learning and therefore building resilience. Training and education should be provided to members of the organization. Effective training and education will help members to take the initiative to learn and translate learned knowledge into abilities. At the same time, the development of resilience at the individual, team, and organizational levels should be strengthened.The Influence of HPWS (X) on Employee Service Performance (Y2)Hypothesis 3 (H3) examines the influence of the HPWS (X) on Employee Service Performance (Y2). The results show that the p-value is 0.00 and the original value (estimated coefficient) is positive at 0.409. It means the HPWS has a significant influence on the Employee Service Performance with an inline relationship. In general, it can be stated that the increase of HPWS by 1 percent will boost Employee Service Performance by 40.9 percent.HPWS has a positive and significant influence on Employee Service Performance. Table 7 shows how HPWS influences Employee Service Performance both directly and indirectly, with the Resilience variable serving as a moderator variable in this study. These findings suggest that if the company wants to increase line with the study results by Cooper et al. (2019), there is a positive and significant effect between the HPWS variables on Employee Resilience. Social climate indirectly affects the relationship between HPWS and Employee Resilience. Training, development, learning, supportive leadership, and information sharing, contribute to individual and social capital development in the workplace. According to Cooke et al. (2016), employee resilience can be developed through a variety of strategies, including training, knowledge sharing, teamwork, and supportive leadership. Even though employee resilience is at medium to high levels, the company must nonetheless pay attention to the challenges experienced by employees at the workplace. Employees need a psychologically safe and mutually supportive work environment to cope with work pressures and work more productively. According to Kaski et al. (2020), when employees are faced with job demands that drain their energy, the environment, and other resources are needed to motivate and re-energize them to keep them engaged in their work. The Influence of Employee Resilience (Y1) on Employee Service Performance (Y2)Hypothesis 2 (H2) examines the influence of Employee Resilience (Y1) on Employee Service Performance (Y2). The test results show that the p-value is 0.00 and the original value (estimated coefficient) is positive at 0.384. It means that Employee Resilience has a significant influence on Employee Service Performance with an inline relationship. In general, it can be explained that the increase in Employee Resilience by 1 percent will boost Employee Service Performance by 38.4 percent.Employee resilience has a positive and significant influence on employee service performance (Table 6). Great employee performance is very helpful to institutions in achieving their strategic goals, but it might have an impact on employees’ ability to complete duties when they lose their resilience (Zaman et al. 2020). The results of the study show that during the pandemic, as a state-owned bank, Bank XYZ is responsible for disseminating government initiatives throughout Indonesia. Frontline employees of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office are unquestionably an essential point of distribution for programs in the Makassar Region. Employees may experience increased Indonesian Journal of Business and Entrepreneurship, Vol. 3 No. 2, May 201746P-ISSN: 2407-5434  E-ISSN: 2407-7321Accredited by Ministry of RTHE Number 32a/E/KPT/2017Jurnal Aplikasi Bisnis dan Manajemen (JABM), Vol. 9 No. 1, Januari 2023HPWS in HR practice, especially on indicators of sharing information, training by commitment, and reduced status barriers. The company has successfully implemented 5 (five) aspects of HPWS, nevertheless, if HPWS is improved, employee resilience and employee service performance will improve. The following are some of the managerial implications that can be implemented:1. Information on employee responsibilities, product knowledge, targets, and conditions of the company should be disseminated fairly to all frontline employees at each branch office. Managers must ensure that new employees have the same information and understanding as existing employees, making it easier for them to fulfill their tasks. Every employee must know and comprehend KPIs, as well as design and implement plans to achieve them.2. Holding regular employee sharing sessions about product knowledge as well as how frontline employees may solve customer problems. This can improve communication among employees and knowledge of how to handle consumer complaints. Sharing sessions can be an excellent method for improving employee knowledge and easier to schedule for each branch.3. Organizing training outside of business hours. This is difficult to achieve in a pandemic due to the enormous demand for human resources in the field. However, the dissemination of information and the advantages of training must be felt by every employee to improve employee competency and service performance in the short and long term.4. Managing the entering and leaving of frontline employees. HR planning (manpower planning) and frontline employee workflow must be redesigned by the leaders of Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office and branch offices. The supervisors of each branch office must develop a mutually supportive, open, and courteous work environment. The supervisors must be able to excite the employees, instill enthusiasm in them, maintain professionalism, and foster a culture of supporting one another.5. The supervisors of each branch office must develop a mutually supportive, open, and courteous work environment. The supervisors must be able to excite the employees, instill enthusiasm in them, maintain professionalism, and foster a culture of supporting one another. Leaders must begin to offer an understanding of the company’s targets to the frontline employees as part of the strategy to employee service performance, it should focus on aspects related to HPWS and employee resilience. A study by Gurlek and Uygur (2021) showed that HR attribution, trust in the organization, and commitment sequentially mediate the relationship between service-oriented HPWS and the service performance of hotel employees and line managers.Based on the answers to open-ended questions, about 17 percent of respondents stated that they needed a supportive work environment and facilities. Employees must have access to facilities that make it easier for them to perform their jobs, as this impacts how quickly they can deliver excellent service to customers. Employees and superiors must cooperate to establish a positive working environment. Ojo et al. (2021) stated that a mutually supportive organizational culture, especially in work practices, strengthens employee resilience and results in work engagement. Nam (2014) and Ter Hoeven et al. (2016) stated that employees are provided with work facilities to ensure that they do their responsibilities, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of technology in the workplace reduces work stress, resulting in increased resilience. To deal with occupational pressures like stress, individual uses both personal and professional resources.HPWS implementation is extremely beneficial to companies in terms of enhancing employee service performance. HPWS is an effective tool for improving employee service performance (Wang and Xu, 2017). High-performing HR practices in the organization improve employees’ knowledge, skills, and talents, as well as their motivation and performance in the service delivery process (Karatepe and Vatankhah, 2014). Wang and Xu (2017) argued that fair rewards, adequate training, and active and participatory involvement are the major aspects of HPWS that help increase employee competence, motivation, and performance. In this study, the company must examine HPWS practices since it particularly handles cash, credit, and other financial transactions.Managerial ImplicationsThe results showed that the HPWS variable had a positive and significant effect on the variables of Employee Resilience and Employee Service Performance.

The Partial Least Squares Approach to improve the performance of the Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office. Leaders must also recognize and reward outstanding employees. Positive feedback, incentives, or merely praise will boost employee morale. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSConclusionsThe results of the hypothesis test show that the high-performance work system (HPWS) has a positive and significant effect on Employee Resilience. Employee Resilience positively and significantly affects Employee Service Performance. HPWS directly or indirectly has a positive and significant effect on the variable of Employee Resilience and Employee Service Performance at Bank XYZ Makassar Regional Office. These results indicate, to improve the service performance of employees, the company must improve the employee work system and pay attention to employee resilience.
