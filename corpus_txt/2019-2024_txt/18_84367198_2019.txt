Abstract
The study of resilience of the industrial sector to shock influences is especially urgent taking into account the constant 
instability of the economic and political environment in Ukraine and in the world. The aim of the paper is to determine the 
resilience level of Ukrainian industry to shock influences for improving state support programs for industrial production and 
decreasing negative results of shock influences on economy of the country. Thus, the object of the study is Ukrainian industry. 
Methods of comparative analysis have been used in the paper. Based on parameters of economic safety, there have been deter-
mined main indicators that allow to estimate the resilience level of industry to external and internal shocks. These indicators 
include estimation of the condition of industry of the country, namely: its ability to keep balance and to renew itself after 
shocks, general parameters of economic effectiveness such as labor productivity, labor intensity, profitability of operational 
activity, indices of the level of technological support of industry. Resilience to shocks of the external sector is presented by the 
analysis of indicators of export-import operations. For objectivity of the conducted analysis, indicators of Ukrainian industry 
have been compared with European countries. According to the results of the conducted analysis, the conclusion has been made 
about the unstable condition of Ukrainian industry, because eleven of thirteen analyzed indicators are beyond threshold values, 
and only two ones: labor intensity of industrial production and a share of manufacturing industry in GDP are lower or within a 
threshold value. For providing the growth of industrial production in separate regions of Ukraine, there it has been offered to 
create a base productions in industry. The following base productions have been determined in Ukrainian industry: production 
of engines of different types, semiconductors and microelectronics, constructor materials, diverse products of inter-branch 
destination.
Keywords: resilience, industry, shock influences, profitability, innovations, employment, Ukraine.

1. Introduction 
The direction of this study is especially urgent after the second economic crisis of 2008–
2009 years, when added value in industry, including building sector reduced by 4.62 % in the world 
and by 19.47 % in Ukraine. Socio-economic results of this crisis that coincided with socio-political 
processes in Ukraine in 2013–2014 years threaten the competitiveness of national economy and 
its long-term growth. Especially, Ukraine lowered by 11 positions to 84 place in the rating of the 
World economic forum about competitiveness of world economies in 2013–2014. The reduction on 
Ukrainian GDP by 6.55 % took place in the same period.

We think that the scientifically grounded determination of the resilience degree of Ukrainian 
industry to negative external influences will favor the improvement of state support programs for 
industrial production and decrease of negative results of shock influences on economy of the coun-
try, and also will help to understand, which shocks need a correspondent reaction of the state and 
will have more influence of introducing regulating arrangements of the state for renewal and in-
crease of the resilience level of economy in whole. 
Let’s consider three widespread scientific approaches to studying the resilience of national 
economy. The first one is through the standard analysis of business cycles, dividing economic data 
in general-trend and cyclic components, and associating cyclic components with temporary devia-
tions from a trend because of macroeconomic shocks. The second one – the adjustment of economy 
to shocks is studied through the variation methodology, analyzing the reaction of macroeconomic 
variables to unpredictable shock influences. And the last, the dynamic stochastic general modeling 
of balance, where the structural economic model, which parameters are verified or calculated, is 
used for determining the influence of shocks on economy [1, 2].
According to the first method, fluctuations of a business cycle are divided in general com-
ponents (that fix the synchronized part of a reaction to shocks by countries) and idiosyncratic 
components (that fix the non-synchronized part of a reaction). Idiosyncratic reactions may exist by 
two causes: because of shocks, typical for a country or market, or because different countries or 
markets have different resilience to general disturbances. In whole, observations of idiosyncratic 
fluctuations of business-cycle motivated scientists to try to estimate a reaction of macroeconomic 
parameters as a response to economic shocks in the aspect of resilience that economy “opposes” to 
the influence of general disturbances with. But for estimating economic parameters in such a way, 
a distinct definition of “resilience” and shocks that must be studied, is necessary. 
Foreign scientists [3, 4] define resilience as an ability of countries to support an output, close 
to the potential, after shocks. It is measured by two ways: by analyzing, how strong the influence 
of global shocks on the decline of national production is (amplification effect) and how fast it is 
eliminated after shocks (persistence effect). Changes of parameters, connected with the production 
decrease, measure the persistence effect, and ones, connected with shocks, - amplification effect. 
A difference between the amplification effect and resilience to negative external effects is 
essential, because institutes that help to weaken the shock influence can do them more resilient. For 
example, the strict regulation of employment can prevent firms from dismissing workers, favoring 
stabilization and consumption level in the shot-term prospect. But the same state intervention can 
result in increasing costs of enterprises and longer renewal in final, delaying its production renewal 
in a potential value. 
Then scientists [5] have analyzed how institutes influence an amplification effect and per-
sistence effect of shock results, measuring these parameters through institutional changes of the 
commodity market and labor one. The set of institutional variables included: (I) change of re-
dundancy award; (ІІ) rigid legislation about employment protection; (III) rigid regulation of the 
commodity market in seven non-production branches; (IV) payments at dismissal; and (V) degree 
of centralization of fixing a salary. Variables (II), (III) and (V) turned to be the most important in 
explaining differences in amplification and persistence effects of shocks. For having a possibility to 
take into account other factors that can influence resilience, a share of mortgage debt of households 
to GDP, share of bank credits to the market value of safety stocks (differences in monetary and 
credit policy) and share of the total volume of tax incomes to GDP (differences in the volume of 
automatic stabilizers) have been included as regressors. In whole the research results indicate that 
rigid rules of state regulation of the labor market soften a short-term shock effect, but make shock 
results stronger. 
Native scientists [6] note that industry and agriculture in Ukraine are determining sources 
of the economic development that directly influence its resilience. Resilience of the bank economic 
sector is rather important and studied in literature; scientists [7] note that it directly influences the 
general resilience of economy to shock influences. Other scientists [8] define enterprising sector 
resilience to shock influences as a possibility of renewal after a crime, unwell competition or xeno-
phobia. Scientific literature also underlines the importance of formation and development of infor-

mational economy, modern high-technological economic branches for accelerating the economic 
development of the country and its resilience support [9]. 
Reforms that liberalize commodity markets, raise resilience of economy at least by two ways 
[10, 11]: by the effective distribution and by the effective production. Liberalization of commodity 
markets may increase the effectiveness of resource distribution, simplifying entering at the market, 
and also at the expanse of increasing its competitiveness that provides the faster redistribution of 
resources both within a branch and between them. 
Microeconomic theory connects changes in demand with changes of incomes through elas-
ticity of demand (costs) for different goods. At economic declines, when people see that their per-
sonal incomes fall, the relative demand for goods and services changes according to elasticity of 
demand for products. The research results testify that the sector of consumption goods is more 
resilient than one of investments or intermediate goods [12]. 
So, a lot of works in economic literature are devoted to the problem of resilience of economy 
and its sectors, but not enough attention is paid to the analysis of its separate branches, especially 
industry. From our point of view, industry plays a central role in the development of Ukrainian 
economy that is why it is urgent today under conditions of essential economic instability to study 
the support of its ability to resist shocks. 
2. Aim of research
The main aim of the study is to determine the level of resilience of Ukrainian industry to 
shock influences and to compare resilience indicators with European countries. 
3. Materials and Methods
Based on economic safety parameters, let’s determine main indicators that allow to estimate 
the resilience level of industry to external and internal shocks qualitatively [made by the author 
by 13] (Table 1).

Using this system of indicators, it is possible to estimate how resilient industry of a coun-
try is to both internal and external shocks. Indicators include the estimation of the condition of 
industry of a country, namely: its ability to keep balance and to renew itself after shocks, general 
parameters of economic effectiveness such as labor productivity, labor intensity, profitability of op-
erational activity. There included also the level of technical support of industry that is important for 
resilience of economy in whole. Resilience of industry to shocks of the external sector is presented 
by indices of export-import operations. 
4. Results
Let’s use parameters, presented in Table 1.
The share of manufacturing industry in GDP, percent. Manufacturing industry supports 
resilience of economy by providing own production with products with a high added value. Due 
to the essential share of manufacturing industry in GDP, economy of a country is able to form the 
stable potential for the economic growth. 
The share of manufacturing industry in Ukrainian GDP decreases in advanced rates com-
paring with extracting industry (Table 2).

If in 2001 the ratio between manufacturing and extracting industry by the products output 
was 7.4; by intermediate consumption 9.2, by gross added value 4.2, in 2015 these indices were 6.5; 
10.7; 2.5 respectively. The share of manufacturing industry decreased most essentially from 17.4 to 
14.0 %. The analogous index in extracting industry on the contrary increased from 4.2 to 5.6 %. So, 
the share of manufacturing industry in GDP of Ukraine in 2001–2015 had a tendency to decrease 
and was 28.7 %, but within threshold values 20–30 % of GDP.
The shares of extracting and manufacturing industry in GDP of EU-28 have also a tendency 
to decrease (Table 3). In Germany – leading EU country by the economic development – the share 
of extracting industry is less – 0.42 %, but the one of manufacturing industry is higher than the 
average index – 67.47 %, that proves the industrial development of this country. 
In Poland that is closer to Ukraine by the economic development, the share of extracting 
industry in GDP is 2.79 %, manufacturing – 67.20 %. In Ukraine these indices were 4.4 %, and 
28.7 % respectively in 2015 (Table 2). From this comparison we can see the lag of the Ukrainian 
industrial development, namely manufacturing industry from the developed world countries in the 
share of producing and maintaining the national economy growth, namely at the expanse of prod-
ucts with a high added value.

The population employment level in industry, percent. The employment of population sup-
ports resilience of the economic industrial sector at the expanse of the rational use of existent pro-
duction resources. The number of employed in industry has a stable tendency to decrease, which 
rates are higher than the average ones in economy of Ukraine (Fig. 1). 
Fig. 1. Population employment level in Ukrainian industry, percent of whole employed population 
[14, p. 51]
If in 2000 it reached 22.8 % of whole employed population, in 2016 – 12.9 %. By the index 
of population employment in industry Ukraine is lower than the threshold value 20 % that nega-
tively influences resilience of the economic industrial center. The number of employed in machine 
engineering decreased by the highest rates. If in whole industry the number of workers decreased 
from 2000 to 2015 almost twice, in machine engineering – in 3 times. 
The analysis of the dynamics of the number of workers by types of industrial activity in EU 
countries allows to determine the following tendencies. The extracting industry in EU countries 
occupies almost 1 % of employed, manufacturing one varies from 20 to 25 % of the whole working 
force, whereas in Ukraine these indices are 12 % and 65.6 % respectively. High-technological sec-
tors of machine engineering became in a difficult situation. Thus, the electric industry in Ukraine 
is near destruction: the number of employed decreased from 280 thousand persons (in 1990) to 
4 thousand persons (in 2015). 
In the European Union the percent of employed in industry has a tendency to decrease 
(Table 4), that completely correlates with processes of decreasing the number of employed in in-
dustry in Ukraine. But in industrially developed Germany such tendency is kept as opposite to 
Poland, where the number of employed in industry remains stable for the last decade.

In general Poland is closer to Ukraine by the level of economic development. Twice more 
working population than in Ukraine is engaged in the industrial complex in this country. Such 
discordance testifies to the insufficiently high level of industrial production in Ukraine. On the 
contrary in EU there is observed the stable tendency to increasing a share of working population 
in the service sphere [4]. In EU in whole 73.1 %, in Germany and Poland – 73.9 % and 58.3 % 
respectively.

The wear and tear degree of main industrial means, percent (Fig. 2). Wear and of main 
means demonstrate a degree of their correspondence to the modern STP. The high wear and tear 
degree of main means testifies to the low adjustability of industry to modern challenges, so the low 
level of its resilience to negative internal and external influences. 
The condition of main means in industry decreases the resilience level of the industrial 
economic sector of Ukraine. The wear and tear degree of main means in economy of the country 
is 58.1 %, and in industry – 69.4 %, that indicates the critical wear and tear level of main means in 
Ukraine, because the threshold value of this index is 35 %.
Fig. 2. Wear and tear degree of main means in industry in Ukraine, percent [16]
The share of high-technological products in the total volume of realized industrial products 
(percent) positively influences resilience formation of the industrial economic sector (Table 5).

The more value of this indicator, the more resilient industry to shock influences is. As we 
can see from Table 5, the indicator of the share of high-technological products in the total volume 
of realized industrial products in Ukraine for 2016 was 0.57 %. This indicator has a stable tendency 
to decrease since 2001, when it was 2.94 %. So, resilience of the industrial sector is threatened, 
because the threshold index value is 3–5 %.
The labor intensity of industrial production (percent) which content in the context of our 
study is considered as an indicator, reversed to resilience of the industrial production sector, be-
cause the more employed are needed for one unit of a product, the less effective (that is less resilient 
to shocks) such production is (Table 6).
The labor intensity of industrial production is Ukraine has a tendency to decrease that pos-
itively influences the resilience level of the economic industrial sector, reached 8.4 % in 2016 and 
remained at the level, lower than threshold values (10–15 %).
The profitability of operational activity of industrial enterprises (percent) supports resil-
ience of the industrial sector, because more profit allows enterprises to have more “reserves” for 
reactions to possible shocks.

The profitability of operational activity in industry for the studied period was at level 2–5 % 
that made impossible full-value crediting, when a price for credit use exceeded 20 percents. At that 
the profitability level of industrial enterprises remains low and is 4.2 % (Fig. 3), at threshold values 
5–10 % that indicates the low resilience level of industrial enterprises, because they are not able to 
provide a “financial pillow” for themselves in a case of shock fluctuations in economy.

The volume of industrial products with the high manufacturing degree, realized abroad 
(percent) (Table 7), that determines resilience of economy through its competitiveness at the world 
market. The higher indicator, the more developed the industrial sector of a country is. The param-
eter is important for providing resilience of the industrial sector, because it shows, what share of 
products with a high manufacturing degree is supplied abroad by economy of a country. That is 
what place such economy occupies in the international labor distribution: is it a supplier of raw 
materials to the world market or one of products with a high added value. The resilience level is 
directly proportional to the level of “raw material orientation” of economy, because at fluctuations 
of world prices for raw materials, under conditions of a low share of added value in them, suppliers 
of raw material products find themselves in a difficult situation for providing their further opera-
tional activity. 
As it can be seen on Table 7, export of groups of industrial commodities, related to the cat-
egory of the high manufacturing degree, namely capital equipment (except transport), components, 
parts and devices for it, transport equipment, components, parts and devices for it in the total ex-
port of Ukraine fell from 7.2 % in 2013 to 3.1 % in 2016, at threshold value 10–15 % that indicates 
that Ukraine belongs to the group of countries that export raw materials and, correspondingly, has 
the low resilience level to shock influences. 
The share of industrial goods in export to GDP, percent. Positively influences resilience of 
the economic industrial sector, because the more share of export of industrial goods in GDP, the 
more important place is occupied by economy of a country in the world labor distribution, so, the 
better it can adjust to shock influences (Table 8).

The share of industrial goods in import to GDP. The indicator is reversed to resilience 
(Table 8). It demonstrates the dependence of economy on import of goods, which output is not 
enough in a country, such as machines, equipment, that investment processes and structural 
shifts in economy are impossible without. For 2010–2016 the share of industrial goods in export 
to GDP of Ukraine had a tendency to decrease from 21.8 % to 16.6 % that negatively influ-
enced resilience of the industrial sector to shock influences, but this index is within threshold 
values –15–40 %. 
The share of industrial goods in import of Ukraine had a tendency to increase – from 
17.8 % in 2010 to 20.3 % in 2016. The value of this indicator is beyond threshold values 15–20 % 
that testifies to the threat to resilience in industrial import.
Alongside with it, for determining resilience of the economic production sector to shock 
influences, namely the level of its dependence on import products that is dependence on changes 
in economic activity abroad, the share of import in internal consumption (percent) must be ana-
lyzed (Table 9). This indicator shows the dependence of national production, including industry, 
on import of products. The more indicator, the less resilient industrial production of a country is. 
Table 9 indicates that the share of import in internal consumption since 2010 grew from 
22.2 % to 25.5 % in 2016. It testifies to the increase of dependence of national economy and indus-
trial production on import of products that negatively influences resilience of the industrial sector. 
But the value of indicator is within threshold limits – 30 %.

So, the results of the analysis of resilience of the industrial sector to external economic ac-
tivity may be summarized: the Ukrainian industrial sector is within resilience parameters by the 
indicator of share of industrial goods in export, and not essentially higher threshold values – by the 
indicator of share of industrial goods in import. It testifies to the stable condition of the industrial 
sector in the aspect of export activity and not high dependence of resilience of the industrial sector 
on import. A dependence on import in internal consumption in industry is moderate. A negative 
factor that influences resilience of industry to shock influences is the low share of products with 
a high added value, that are high-technological ones, so their export abroad. Export of industrial 
goods, belonging to the category of high manufacturing degree was 3.1 % in the total export of 
Ukraine in 2016, at threshold value 10–15 %. It testifies to the fact that Ukraine belongs to the group 
of countries that export raw material. Countries that export mainly raw materials, which share of 
added price in a final price of a good is low, are dependent from fluctuations of world prices for such 
products, so have the low resilience level to shock influences. 
The share of products, realized at competitive markets to the total volume of products (for 
the beginning of the year) (Fig. 4). Supports resilience of economy by forming the competitive en-
vironment of a country, because the more competitive market is, the faster it can be renewed after 
shock influences and vice versa. 
Fig.4. Share of products, realized at competitive markets of Ukraine  
(for the beginning of the year) [19]
The competitiveness level at Ukrainian markets is low. From 2010 to 2014 the share of 
products, realized at competitive markets, according to the data of the Antimonopoly committee 
of Ukraine, was 48.3 % and 42.7 %. This index is far beyond the threshold value that is 70 %, that 
testifies to the negative influence on resilience of the economic industrial center. 
The important value for resilience of economy in whole and especially industry is inherent 
to the level of innovative activity of enterprises. This parameter allows to determine long-term 
prospects of national enterprises and the level of their activity orientation on current factors of 
competitiveness, which term is rather limited.

The specific weight of enterprises that introduced innovations in the total number of in-
dustrial enterprises (percent). Provides resilience of economy by forming the own environment 
of production and realization of innovations in industry. It reflects the ability of economy to the 
intensive growth. 
The specific weight of realized innovative products in the volume of industry, percent. Sup-
ports resilience of economy by the ability to provide its innovative growth by own forces (national 
producer). 
The low level of innovative activity in whole in industry attracts attention – because the spe-
cific weight of enterprises that introduced innovations is 16,6 % of the total number of enterprises 
[14, p. 504] (Table 10) at threshold indicator value – 30 %. If to compare with EU countries, where 
the level of innovatively oriented enterprises is 50 % and more, the situation in Ukraine looks even 
more critical.

Among leaders by percent of innovatively active enterprises is production of main phar-
maceutical products (47.5 %), computers, electric and optic products (37.5 %), motor transport 
vehicles, trailers and semitrailers and other transport (37.0 %), production of coke and oil man-
ufacturing products (28.6 %), electric equipment (28.2 %), chemical substances and products 
(27.0 %), machines and equipment (26.2 %) [14, p. 504]. Just these branches belong to high-tech-
nological ones, which share, except pharmaceutics, has a tendency to decrease in the total struc-
ture of industry. 
The specific weight of realized innovative products in the total volume of industrial ones 
is 1.4 %, at threshold value 10–15 %. The indicator value shows that Ukraine don’t supply own 
industrial production of innovative products, so depends on external markets that makes economy 
of the country and correspondingly industry highly dependent on fluctuations of economic activity 
and external negative influences. 
4. Discussion 
There are many researches, devoted to separating factors that influence resilience of 
economy in whole and its separate branches. Let’s separate factors that favor resilience of 
the industrial sector to shocks. Foreign scientists [5] determine what sectors of economy are 
least resilient to shocks, so need more structural reforms. Scientists used for the analysis both 
general and branch indices of inflation and total output after shock effects in countries. As 
a result of their study, it was found out that «agriculture and extracting industry” are most 
resilient sectors, whereas “trade” and “business-services” are least resilient, although there 
are differences in ranging sectors depending on what shocks are taken into account, ones of 
demand or supply. 
According to the results of the conducted analysis of the indicators of industry resil-
ience to negative external influences (Table 11), we can talk about the non-resilient condition 
of Ukrainian industry, because eleven of thirteen analyzed indicators are beyond threshold 
values, and only two indicators: labor intensity of industrial production and share of manufac-
turing industry in GDP are lower or within the threshold value that is positive for resilience of 
the industrial sector.

The aforesaid allows to make a conclusion that in the first 25 years of independence the 
pseudo-resilient socio-economic system formed in Ukraine. The role of industry in it decreases 
more and more. On the background of the general decrease of the role of industry in Ukrainian 
economy, regress is observed in technological orders – from high to low ones: the share of manu-
facturing industry decreases, especially one of such high-technological part as machine engineer-
ing, and the share of raw material branches increases synchronously. 
6. Conclusions 
The results of the conducted analysis of resilience of Ukrainian industry to shock influences 
allow to state: 
1. Resilience of economy to shocks is the ability of the economic industrial sector to react 
and adjust to both internal and external irritants, keeping stable rates of the economic growth. This 
is just the “protective barrier” in the industrial sector that allows it to function stably, timely adjust-
ing to changes in the external environment. 
2. The share of manufacturing industry in GDP of Ukraine for 2001–2015 had a tendency to 
decrease and was 28.7 %, but within the threshold values as 20–30 % of GDP. There is traced the 
structural unevenness of industrial production with predominance of extracting industry over man-
ufacturing one. It testifies to the resource directionality of Ukrainian economy and products with a 
low share of added value. Industrial production in Ukraine transforms in one of the low-technologi-
cal order, the raw material specialization gains momentum at the synchronous reduction and almost 
complete liquidation of high-technological production branches that is reflected on the condition of 
internal market, low share of own production goods. 
The number of employed in industry has a stable tendency to decrease, which rates are 
higher than average in economy of Ukraine. If in 2000 it reached 22.8 % of the whole employed 
population, in 2016 – 12.9 %. The index of employment level of the population in industry of 
the country is beyond the threshold value as 20 % that negatively influences resilience of the 
economic industrial center.

The condition of main means in industry prevents resilience of the Ukrainian economic 
industrial center. The wear and tear degree of main means for 2016 in economy of the country was 
58.1 %, in industry – 69.4 % that testifies to the critical level of wear and tear of main means of 
Ukraine, because the threshold value of this parameter is 35 %
The indicator of the share of high-technological products in the total volume of realized 
industrial products in Ukraine for 2017 was only 0.5 %. This indicator has a stable tendency to 
decline since 2001, when it was 2.94 %. So, resilience of the industrial sector is threatened, because 
the threshold value of the parameters is 3–5 %.
The labor intensity of industrial production in Ukraine has a tendency to decline that pos-
itively influences the resilience level of the economic industrial sector, being 8.4 % in 2016 and 
remaining lower the threshold values that are 10–15 %.
At that the profitability level of industrial enterprises remains low and is 4.2 %, at thresh-
old values 5–10 %. It testifies to the low resilience of industrial enterprises, because they are not 
able to guarantee a “financial pillow” of resilience for themselves in a case of shock fluctuations 
in economy. 
In 2010–2016 the share of industrial goods in export to GDP of Ukraine had a tendency 
to decrease from 21.8 % to 16.6 % that negatively influenced resilience of the industrial sector to 
shock influences, but the value of this parameters is within threshold values – 15–40 %. 
The share of industrial goods in import of Ukraine had a tendency to increase – from 
17.8 % in 2010 to 20.3 % in 2016. The value of this indicator is beyond the threshold values as 
15–20 % that indicates the threat to resilience in industrial import. 
A negative factor that influences resilience of Ukrainian industry is the low share of prod-
ucts with a high added value, that are high-technological ones, so their export abroad. Export of 
industrial goods, belonging to the category of high manufacturing degree was 3.1 % in the total 
export of Ukraine in 2016, at threshold value 10–15 %. So, Ukraine belongs to the group countries 
that export mainly raw materials, which share of added price in a final price of a good is low, are 
dependent from fluctuations of world prices for such products, so have the low resilience level to 
shock influences. 
The competition level at Ukrainian markets is low. From 2010 to 2014 the share of products, 
realized at competitive markets, according to the data of the Antimonopoly committee of Ukraine, 
was 48.3 % and 42.7 %. This index is far beyond the threshold value that is 70 %, that testifies to 
the negative influence on resilience of the economic industrial center. 
The low level of innovative activity in whole in industry attracts attention – 16.6 % of the 
total number of enterprises (the threshold indicator value is 30 %). If to compare with EU countries, 
where the level of innovatively oriented enterprises is 50 % and more, the situation in Ukraine 
looks even more critical. 
The specific weight of realized innovative products in the total volume of industrial ones is 
1.4 %, at threshold value 10–15 %. The indicator value shows that Ukraine doesn’t supply own 
industrial production of innovative products, so depends on external markets. It forms the high 
dependence of economy of the country and especially industrial sector on fluctuations of eco-
nomic activity.
So, according to the results of the conducted analysis of the indicators of industry resilience 
to negative external influences, we can talk about the non-resilient condition of Ukrainian industry, 
because eleven of thirteen analyzed indicators are beyond threshold values, and only two indica-
tors: labor intensity of industrial production and share of manufacturing industry in GDP are lower 
or within the threshold value that is positive for resilience of the industrial sector. 
3. The results of the statistical analysis of reactions of Ukrainian industry to shock influ-
ences, namely world crisis of 2008–2009 and national crisis of 2013–2014 indicate the coincidence 
between economic braches of Ukraine and EU by the resilience level. The least resilient economic 
industrial branches of Ukraine are: machine engineering, including motor transport vehicles and 
other transport; metallurgical production, metal processing; chemical substances and products. 
The most resilient branches of Ukrainian industry are: food industry, production of pharmaceutical 
products and preparations.

4. Guaranteeing of resilience of the economic industrial sector to negative external influenc-
es needs changing a paradigm of the economic policy of the state: refusal of liberal conceptions, 
where the state had a role of a side observer of economic processes and transfer to active forms of 
the state influence of economy. 
For providing the growth of industrial production in separate regions of Ukraine, it is nec-
essary to create base productions that are the ground of one or another product and determine its 
technical and consumption parameters. In industry there are: production of engines of different 
types and destinations, semiconductors and microelectronics, constructor materials, diverse prod-
ucts of inter-branch destination. 
Limitations
The data of different periods of 2015–2016 by several indicators and parameters are 
used in the paper, because at the moment of writing it, official sources didn’t contain more 
urgent information.
