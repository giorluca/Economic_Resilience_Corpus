Notethat these charts are qualitatively similar to those for the GDP results. These twoendogenous variables have a broadly symmetric time path and both the employment andhousehold income figures are above their initial values in period 6; that is, immediatelyafter the temporary negative export shock is removed. For these variables, the myopicsimulations again show reductions whose absolute size increases for the whole period overwhich the shock operates. The subsequent recovery is much slower and is not completeuntil period 22. The imperfect foresight case has the most pronounced fall in employmentand household income over periods 1 to 5. Subsequently the recovery is faster than forthe myopic simulations and there is subsequent overshooting and damped oscillations asthe variables return to their original values. The perfect foresight simulations exhibit thesmallest variation.The short-run, period-1, proportionate reduction in employment is always greaterthan the corresponding change in GDP. This is because in this period capital stock isfixed so that changes in employment are the only source of changes in GDP. However, byperiod 3 the fall in GDP is proportionately larger, as against the base year value, thanemployment as the capital stock downwardly adjusts following significant reductions ininvestment. In period 6 there is a large percentage increase in employment, as againstthe period-5 value, in the imperfect foresight, but particularly the myopic cases.2Figure A.1.1: Period-by-period adjustment in employment: percentage deviation fromthe initial value0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.40.5Periods/Years%changefrombaselinePerfect foresightMyopicImperfect foresightFigure A.1.2: Period-by-period adjustment in household income: percentage deviationfrom the initial value0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.8−1.7−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.3Periods/Years%changefrombaselinePerfect foresightMyopicImperfect foresight3A.2 Sensitivity AnalysisFigures A.2.1 to A.2.6 show the sensitivity of the path of the changes in GDP to varia-tions in the nature of the exogenous demand shock. Figures A.2.7 to A.2.9 indicate thesensitivity of the GDP results to variations in the nature of the labour market. In allthese cases the sensitivity is shown for each of the three investment functions.Figures A.2.1 to A.2.3 concern the size of the reduction in export demand aroundthe value of 5% used in the main body of the text. In each Figure results are shownfor reductions of 4% and 6% as well as the default reduction of 5%. Figures A.2.1,A.2.2 and A.2.3 are for the perfect foresight, myopic expectations and imperfect foresightinvestment functions respectively. As can be seen, these variations have only quantitative,not qualitative, impacts on the GDP changes.Figure A.2.1: Perfect foresight: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (size sensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.40.5Periods/Years%changefrombaseline4%5%6%4Figure A.2.2: Myopic: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (size sensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.40.5Periods/Years%changefrombaseline4%5%6%Figure A.2.3: Imperfect foresight: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (size sensitiv-ity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.4Periods/Years%changefrombaseline4%5%6%5Following an identical pattern, Figures A.2.4 to A.2.6 give the impact of varyingthe length of the time period over which the negative export demand shock applies.The figures show the results for time periods of lengths 4 and 6 years, together withthe default value of 5 years used in the main body of the text. Varying the time periodimplies simultaneously increasing the maximum negative impact of the demand reductionand also changing the period over which the GDP adjustments occur. For the myopicand imperfect foresight investment cases, shown in Figures A.2.5 and A.2.6, there areno significant qualitative differences in the time path of adjustment as the length of theshock is increased. However, with the perfect foresight case reported in Figure A.2.4,for the 4 year shock the initial overshooting once the shock is withdrawn is much morepronounced than with the default case and, with the 6 year shock, the overshooting iscompletely eliminated.Figure A.2.4: Perfect foresight: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (duration sensi-tivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.4Periods/Years%changefrombaseline4 years5 years6 years6Figure A.2.5: Myopic: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (duration sensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.4Periods/Years%changefrombaseline4 years5 years6 yearsFigure A.2.6: Imperfect foresight: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (durationsensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.4Periods/Years%changefrombaseline4 years5 years6 years7Finally, the results reported in Figures A.2.7 to A.2.9 follow a similar pattern, but inthis case for variations in the nature of the labour market, with the wage curve (WC) asthe default used in the main body of the text. The alternatives are the fixed employment(FE) and the fixed nominal wage (FNW) labour market closures. The FE labour marketis characterised by a fixed labour supply, no unemployment and a flexible wage thatadjusts to equate demand and supply of labour. In the FNW the nominal wage is fixedand the unemployment rate adjusts to equate labour demand and supply. In each figurethe broad qualitative characteristics of the GDP time path are retained through all thelabour market options shown, but there are big differences in the scale of impacts. Alsoboth the FE and FNW labour markets generate time paths for the myopic and imperfectforesight investment functions that are closer than with the wage curve labour marketclosure.Figure A.2.7: Perfect foresight: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (labour marketsensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.4Periods/Years%changefrombaselineFEFNWWC8Figure A.2.8: Myopic: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (labour market sensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−1.8−1.7−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.4Periods/Years%changefrombaselineFEFNWWCFigure A.2.9: Imperfect foresight: Period-by-period adjustment in GDP (labour marketsensitivity)0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50−2.1−2−1.9−1.8−1.7−1.6−1.5−1.4−1.3−1.2−1.1−1−0.9−0.8−0.7−0.6−0.5−0.4−0.3−0.2−0.100.10.20.30.40.5Periods/Years%changefrombaselineFEFNWWC9
