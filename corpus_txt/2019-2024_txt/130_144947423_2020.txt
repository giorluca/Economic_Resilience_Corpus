Chapter 1: Judicial Co-Operation and Economic Recovery in Europe (JCOERE) Report 2: Introduction  Introduction The JCOERE Project is focussed on the concept of co-operation1 between courts and between courts and practitioners across Member States of the European Union. The specific subject matter of the JCOERE Project concerns the obligations imposed by the European Insolvency Regulation2 on courts in European Member States to co-operate in cross-border insolvency matters. Additional obligations are placed on insolvency practitioners to co-operate. Furthermore, in light of new initiatives in the area of corporate restructuring3 the JCOERE Project focussed on this important policy initiative and hypothesised that the nature of the rules typically involved in preventive restructuring frameworks might present further obstacles to co-operation between courts. These rules were both substantive and procedural in nature. Because the JCOERE Project focussed on co-operation and communication obligations contained in the European Insolvency Regulation (Recast) it was appropriate to choose a type of insolvency process covered by this Regulation.4 However, many of the issues raised in this part of the Project and described in this second Report are equally applicable to a broader range of initiatives concerning judicial and court co-operation in the European Union. This broader issue is fundamental to continued European integration. Where an  1 Throughout this report, it should be noted that the spelling of co-operate (cooperate) and co-operation (cooperation) will alternate. This is because they are used interchangeably within the documentation and literature that we have used and referred to throughout the Report. For example, Chapter 2 utilises ‘cooperate’, as that is the spelling found in the EIR Recast. The JCOERE Project itself, by contrast and as articulated above, has ‘co-operation’ in its title.  This is also true for words such as co-ordinate (coordinate) and co-ordination (coordination). 2 Council Regulation (EU) 848/2015 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings (Recast) [2015] OJ L 141/19. [Hereinafter EIR Recast]. See a full discussion of the EIR Recast in Chapter 2. 3 European Commission, ‘Recommendation of 12 March 2014 on a new approach to business failure and insolvency’ [2014] OJ L 74/65, COM (2014) 1500 final. 4 As we examined how Member States approached preventive restructuring in their domestic frameworks both prior to and in anticipation of implementation of the Preventive Restructuring Directive 1023/2019 it became apparent that some domestic legislative processes aimed at corporate rescue were already covered by the European Insolvency Regulation (Annex A) whilst others were not. This in effect means that some preventive restructuring frameworks in Member States will benefit from co-operation obligations in the Regulation, others will not. It is also important to note that the Preventive Restructuring Directive itself allows Member States the choice of whether or not to include the implementing process in Annex A of the Regulation. See Recital 13 and 14 of the PRD. See further Lorenzo Stanghellini and Andrea Zorzi, ‘Coordinating the Prevent Restructuring Directive and the Recast European Insolvency Regulation’ Eurofenix (Autumn 2019) 22.   15  obligation is imposed on courts to co-operate the obvious question is whether there is a specific obligation imposed on members of the judiciary specifically to co-operate. This question is answered affirmatively by some commentators but this report takes the view that this issue is open-ended. (Chapters 3 and 5).  The European Project and Judicial Co-operation At the time of writing the issue of corporate and business insolvency and rescue has unfortunately become acute due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The broader public health and economic threats have yet again raised high level issues concerning the nature of the European project. As President Emmanuelle Macron has observed, the debate focusses on whether the European Union is simply a market project or a political project5 and has stated inter alia that: ‘If the European Union is to succeed as a political project sustained and continued attention must be paid to issues of co-operation and co-ordination in legal spheres.’   A European Judiciary While Chapter 4 of this Report considers matters relating to legal and judicial culture in detail, this section will briefly consider the question of whether there is a distinctive European legal tradition or culture or alternatively if this is not the case there is a real aspiration to create such a culture. This is the context in which co-operation obligations will operate.  As is commonly known, the European Union sets out membership criteria for each accession state which are set out in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht (Article 49).6 A subsequent declaration was made in June 1993 by the European Council in Copenhagen7 which led to the denomination of these more detailed criteria as the ‘Copenhagen criteria.’ The criteria address three areas that form the basis of negotiations with a particular candidate state, namely the political, economic and legislative areas. These areas are used to guide accession states towards EU membership. The legislative criteria focus on what are called ‘rule of law’ issues that are in turn governed by the Rule of Law Framework.8 The Framework was introduced by the European Commission in March 2014 and has three stages, namely a Commission Rule of Law Assessment, a Commission Rule of Law Opinion and a Commission Rule of Law Amendment.9 The official view is that the entire process is based on a continuous  5 Roula Khalaf, ‘Transcript, Emmanuel Macron: ‘We are at a moment of truth’ (English)’, Financial Times (Paris, April 14th, 2020) <https://www.ft.com/content/317b4f61-672e-4c4b-b816-71e0ff63cab2> [Last accessed April 30th, 2020]. 6 Council Treaty of Maastricht on European Union [1992] OJ C 191/1, Article 49.

However, arrangements have now been put in place to police compliance with these criteria, following the  ‘sanctions’ imposed against the Austrian government of Wolfgang Schüssel in early 2000 by the other 14 Member States' governments.10 This process can end with the invocation of Article 7(1) of the TFEU which was threatened in relation to Poland some years later.11 More recently the Commission took action in 2016 and 2017 against Poland in relation to the treatment of members of the judiciary. In its statement on the 26th July 201712  it stated that the reform of the judiciary in Poland ‘amplifies the systemic threat to the rule of law in Poland already identified in the rule of law procedure started by the Commission in January 2016.’ The Commission went on to request that the Polish authorities address the identified problems within a month of this decision and particularly requested the Polish authorities ‘not to take any measure to dismiss or force the retirement of Supreme Court judges.’ The Commission stated that it was ready to implement ‘the Article 7(1) procedure’13 – a formal warning by the EU that can be issued by four fifths of the Member States in the Council of Ministers. At the time a specific connection was made between this issue, the rule of law generally, and the importance of an independent judiciary as an essential precondition for EU membership. The statement of the Commission President Jean Claude Juncker at the time emphasised that a system which included the ability of a state to dismiss judges at will could not operate in the EU, noting that: ‘Independent courts are the basis of mutual trust between our Member States and our judicial systems.’ In other words, a commonly created judiciary is essential to mutual trust between Member States and obviously to detailed co-operation. Vice President Franz Timmermans set out the issue even more explicitly, describing that the courts of each Member State, in this case the courts of Poland, are expected to provide an effective remedy in case of violations of EU law, in which case they act as the ‘judges of the Union.’ This statement sets up an interesting situation whereby Member States have their own  10 See further, Schüssel v Austria, Ap no. 42409/98 (ECHR 21 February 2002).

[Last Accessed 27 April 2020]. 13 Consolidated Version of the Treaty on European Union [2012] OJ C326/13, Article 7(1). [Hereinafter TEU]. Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union provides for the Council, acting by a majority of four fifths of its members, to determine that there is a clear risk of a serious breach by a Member State of the common values referred to in Article 2 of the Treaty (see Annex II). The Commission can trigger this process by a reasoned proposal.  17  independent system for appointing judges, but once appointed judges and courts become in some way judges of the European Union.  1.3.2 The Tampere Council The vision for further integration of the European Union was underpinned by the holding of the Special Council meeting in Tampere Finland in 1999 addressing the need to create a ‘European Area of Justice’. Amongst the milestones articulated by the Council the following statement is made regarding the mutual recognition of judicial decisions at Article 33: Enhanced mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgements and the necessary approximation of legislation would facilitate co-operation between authorities and the judicial protection of individual rights. The European Council therefore endorses the principle of mutual recognition which, in its view, should become the cornerstone of judicial co-operation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union. The principle should apply both to judgements and to other decisions of judicial authorities.14 The Tampere Council provided a platform for the development of mutual recognition of judgements and consequent co-operation between judicial and administrative authorities in Europe. Many areas of law ranging from criminal law, to family law, to commercial law are now subject to specific rules regarding co-operation as between Member State courts in different areas of law.15  Co-operation, Trust, Recognition, and Harmonisation The idea of co-operation is recognised as being underpinned by concepts such as trust in and recognition of member state legal systems in addition to the pursuit of a harmonisation agenda.16 The levels of harmonisation may vary as we have seen in relation to the doctrinal part of the JCOERE project. Combining all four elements will lead to integration of the European Union, but no assumptions are made in this project as to the optimal levels of integration. When the JCOERE Project focussed on preventive restructuring frameworks in Report 1 it became apparent that there were strong underlying differences regarding policy and implementation of rescue processes for corporations and businesses in Europe. Report 1 of the JCOERE Project demonstrated that there were significant differences between policy makers and thought influencers (academics) across the European Union on the theory of preventive restructuring. In surveying 11 jurisdictions within the EU, benchmarked against the newly passed preventive restructuring directive,17 it was clear that there was also significant  14 European Council, ‘Conclusions of the Presidency, European Council in Tampere, 15 and 16 October 1999,’ (1999) <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/summits/tam_en.htm#c?textMode=on> [Last Accessed 27th April, 2020]. 15 See for example European Commission, ‘Compendium of European Union legislation on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters (2018 Edition)’, (European Commission, 19 July 2019). 16 This is also addressed in the context of the text of the European Insolvency Regulation in Chapter 2. 17 Council Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency   18  variation in existing processes. Furthermore the PRD itself allows for continued variation within Member States ranging from what this Project has termed robust restructuring processes, exemplified by the use in practise of the English Scheme of Arrangement processes and the Irish Examinership process (based on the US Chapter 11 process), to much less aggressive restructuring.18 The EIR Recast recognises the reality of ‘widely differing substantive laws’ in the insolvency laws of Member States.19 At the same time however, the EIR Recast also expresses the aspiration that harmonisation projects will successively bring domestic frameworks together, thereby underpinning the elements necessary for further co-operation. Nevertheless, as we have seen in Report 1, the PRD expressly supports widely differing variations in Member State legislative frameworks with the provision of a range of choices allowing for significant variations in types of restructuring processes. 1.4.1 Co-operation and the EIR Recast 2015 Whilst Chapter 2 of this Report will outline the terms of the EIR-Recast in relation to co-operation obligations, Chapter 5 will explore some case law on how this may operate. However, in the context of this Chapter it is worth emphasising how the obligations imposed in the specific insolvency regulation are based on Article 81 TFEU regarding judicial co-operation in civil matters with cross-border implications.20 Furthermore this specific obligation is based on the even broader principle of sincere co-operation outlined in Article 4(3) TFEU.21  Despite these observations and indeed European aspirations, our empirical observation is that court-to-court co-operation is a matter with which members of the European judiciary are not familiar. Even though we certainly found that there was a general understanding of recognition provisions incorporated in the Regulation and in the EIR- Recast, there was much less experience, if any of co-operation during the hearing of a case, or indeed expectation that such an issue would arise.22 However, the specific co-operation obligations are relatively new, having been introduced in the EIR Recast which although passed in 2015 only began to apply on 26 June 2017 (in accordance with art 92) and so it is possible that discussion and consideration of these issues will become more common over time.23  and discharge of debt, and the amending of Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) [2019] OJ L 172/18.

See also the cases that are discussed in Chapter 5 of this report.   19   JCOERE Project Summary to Date Before considering the nature and development of judicial and court co-operation in the European Union, this section will summarise the research of the JCOERE Project to date. As noted above this concerns the development of the theory and law regarding preventive restructuring and rescue within the European Union. In our first Report we described the debate within the Member States regarding the concepts which are fundamental to restructuring. These concepts were explained in an academic context in Chapter 4 of our first Report, relying heavily on commentary from US academics familiar with Chapter 1124 type restructuring processes. Our first Report demonstrated the heated nature of the debate which is taking place in European academic circles triggered by the passing of the PRD.  Second, we concluded that the academic debate has clearly influenced the development of the PRD itself (given that the Commission-DG Justice established and consulted with a range of academic commentators- Commission Group of Experts on restructuring and insolvency law (E03362), in addition to reflecting pre-existing preventive restructuring frameworks in various Member States including for example Ireland’s examinership, the Italian processes and the French sauvegarde. The various iterations of the PRD as described in Chapter 5 of the first JCOERE Report underline this. The contribution of various academic projects including the CODIRE25 project to the development of the PRD is also important. Third, in picking some controversial provisions in preventive restructuring we pursued the hypothesis that court-to-court co-operation would be challenged by the very nature of restructuring. We saw that the intellectual liveliness of the academic debate was both an influence in terms of continued divergence but also reflective of quite divergent approaches to restructuring leading up to, and following, the passing of the PRD. Some of this divergence also arises from the challenge of matching quite diverse legal systems with a harmonising piece of legislation. It was clear that even in terms of terminology there are misunderstandings which we highlighted in Chapter 2 of the first Report.  In addition, as we surveyed different state responses to restructuring it became clear that disagreement and lack of clarity was not only limited to terminology but also existed in relation to key concepts.26 Key concepts included what is termed ‘the threshold question’, namely the question of which companies (those which were tending towards insolvency and / or  those which were insolvent but not formally declared to be) could avail of a restructuring process; the application of a stay or moratorium to other creditors; the treatment of creditors  24 Title 11 of the US Federal Code concerns Bankruptcy Law. Chapter 11 of Title 11 concerns the restructuring process known by the same name. For detail on Chapter 11 of the US Federal Bankruptcy Code see: US Courts, ‘Chapter 11 – Bankruptcy Basics’ (United States Courts) <https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics> [Accessed April 1st, 2020]. 25 Lorenzo Stanghellini, Riz Mokal, Christoph G.

We concluded that even following implementation of the PRD divergence would persist even in relation to these most basic concepts, aggravated in this context by extensive scope within the PRD for differential implementation of its provisions. Fourth, the peculiar interplay between the EIR Recast and the PRD and other restructuring processes raises a range of questions for the potential for mutual recognition under the EIR Recast, let alone co-operation. We will expand on this in this Report.   Framework of the Second Report The following Chapter 2 considers the evolution of the EIR Recast with particular emphasis on co-operation and co-ordination obligations imposed on courts and on insolvency practitioners.28 Our focus is on corporate rescue. The Regulation addresses obligations to co-operate in relation to insolvency processes affecting a single debtor, in our case a single corporate entity, but goes on to describe similar obligations in relation to corporate groups.29 In Chapter 3 the Report will return to our survey of the Member States to firstly place substantive differences in the broader context of judicial and court co-operation and secondly to describe what we broadly define as procedural rules that present obstacles to court-to-court co-operation. This Chapter will be supported by information gathered in the second half of Part III of the JCOERE Questionnaire distributed during the first phase of our research. Accordingly, in Chapter 3 of this Report, we will combine our assessment of the level of disagreement regarding key concepts and substantive rules with our discussion of procedural rules to indicate the potential challenges to co-operation.  1.6.1 Engaging with the European Judiciary During the JCOERE Project we have been fortunate enough to have access to the Judicial Wing of INSOL Europe. We first met the Judicial Wing at the INSOL Europe Annual Conference in Athens in 2018 where an initial presentation of the Project was made and greeted with considerable interest from members of the judiciary present. The presentation covered both the expected enactment of the PRD (which was passed the following June in 2019) and the idea of court-to-court cooperation and the consequent obligations imposed to co-operate which is found in the EIR Recast 848/2015. At that time the members of the judicial wing were extremely interested in engaging with the Project. In fact, the concept of judicial co-operation in insolvency processes was also the subject of a presentation by members of the judiciary at  27 For a discussion on APR V RPR, see Irene Lynch Fannon, ‘‘An Irish Perspective on the Cram-down provisions in the Preventive Restructuring Directive 1023/2019 EU, Guest Editorial’ (2019) 27(3) International Insolvency Review 1; Stephen Lubben, “The Overstated Absolute Priority Rule” (20 March 2015), available at < https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2581639>; Riz Mokal, “The New Relative Priority Rule” (paper presented at the International Insolvency Institute, 17 June 2019, slide 4). This point was repeated by Mokal at the INSOL Europe Academic Forum, Copenhagen 25th and 26th September, 2019). See further Chapter 4 of this Report. 28 EIR Recast, Recital 20 and Articles 41-44. 29 idem, Recitals 53, 54 and 61 and Articles 56-61.    21  the main INSOL Europe Congress held in the following days in Athens. At that point, the judicial members on the panel expressed some reservations about the burden of being obliged to co-operate in cross-border insolvency cases.30 Practical difficulties were also discussed including language barriers and knowledge of Member State processes. In addition, in terms of protocols facilitating co-operation, a matter which is the subject of Chapter 6 of this Report, the participating members of the judiciary expressed a preference for developing protocols in which such co-operation could take place on a case by case basis,31 views which are also reflected in the Responses to the Judicial Survey discussed in Chapter 8. At the second meeting in which JCOERE presented its findings to the INSOL Judicial Wing, this time at the INSOL Europe Annual Congress in Copenhagen, the JCOERE Project was well advanced. At a special meeting the JCOERE Project presented a case study based on an Irish examinership case.32 At this meeting the views of the members present were that once the process was covered in Annex A of the Regulation there would indeed be co-operation. However, practical barriers to co-operation were raised, in particular, the difficulty of accessing information on other member state’s domestic processes. In some jurisdictions for example, judges were directed to specific, approved sources of information, whereas in other jurisdictions this process was considerably more open-ended.  As it happens, one of the final tasks of this Project is to create a database of cases for members of the judiciary to access. In addition, language and equivalence of legal terms and concepts was also considered an issue. In the latter part of the Project a judicial survey has been distributed regarding knowledge of processes and responses to obligations to co-operate and calls for co-operation. In particular, the survey required information on awareness of existing protocols on co-operation. All of this is discussed in both Chapters 6 and 8 of this Report. The JCOERE project has been invited to present its findings at a virtual meeting of the INSOL Judicial Wing in September and has been accepted to present an open panel to the Society of Legal Scholars (again to be held virtually this year) on differences in judicial reasoning in European courts. Finally, all going well the JCOERE project will conduct its final event live in Dublin in November 2020. 1.6.2 Common and Civil Law cultures  During the Project we also became aware of continuing differences between jurisdictions regarding judicial function broadly described. Lawyers from a common law tradition place great emphasis on the role of the judicial branch in interpreting legislation. It has always been part of the accepted tension within the European Union that there was some difference  30 See proceedings of the INSOL Europe Annual Congress, Athens, 2019. INSOL Europe, ‘Past Events: INSOL Europe Annual Congress 2018: Athens, Greece’ (INSOL Europe 2018) < https://www.insol-europe.org/events/past_events/0/start_date/asc/2018> [Last Accessed April 27th 2020]. 31 This seems to reflect experience of actual cases as described in Chapters 3, 5 and 7 of this Report. 32 These documents are available on the JCOERE website. <www.ucc.ie/en/jcoere>, and in Annex I of this Report.    22  between common law countries within the EU33 and civil law countries (which represent the majority of Member States) on the scope of judicial discretion, although this difference was not considered to be generally significant. To our surprise, however, this difference emerged in discussions surrounding the PRD, pre-existing domestic restructuring processes and the role of the courts. Civil lawyers expressed distrust of the role of courts as described by their common law colleagues as arbiters of technical evidence regarding the viability of an enterprise,34 described the development of tests of fairness in domestic restructuring frameworks as being ’random’ 35 where common lawyers described a case by case development of these tests. In one conference a commentator described the role of the US courts as ’capricious’ in interpreting the terms of Chapter 11.36 We consider these ongoing differences arising from legal culture in Chapter 4. 1.6.3 Differences in qualification and training In addition, the creation of a European judiciary- a phrase which has emerged in European policy documents- is quite a challenging project given differences in training, practical backgrounds and cultures. We return to these ideas in Chapter 4. In the meantime, it is worth noting that the EU continues to monitor judicial functions generally within the EU as a whole, issuing documents such as the EU Justice Scoreboard for public consideration. In preliminary remarks in the 2019 edition of this document Věra Jourová, European Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality states that:  We all should share the same objective of improving our European judiciary, as without independent and efficient justice systems, there can be no rule of law, no trust from citizens, and no business and investment-friendly environment.37 1.6.4 Independence The independence of the judiciary is one of the key concepts addressed in the Justice Scoreboard. Interestingly, scores in relation to the perceived independence of the judiciary amongst companies illustrate that Ireland and the Netherlands (both with proactive rescue  33 England and Wales, Northern Ireland within the UK (excluding Scotland) are traditionally described as common law countries. England and Wales being a particularly dominant jurisdiction insofar as corporate rescue was concerned during the recession from 2007-2012/13. Similarly, the Republic of Ireland is a common law jurisdiction with a written Constitution. Cyprus is a third common law jurisdiction within the EU and Malta a final jurisdiction whose laws have roots in common law and civil law combined. 34 Tomáš Richter, ‘Negotiating a restructuring plan: confirmation, cross-class cram-down and valuation’ (Paper presented at ERA Conference, Trier, 7 November 2019). 35 Discussions at YANIL arising from the delivery by Aoife Finnerty (JCOERE) of a paper on the Irish Examinership Process entitled ‘Preventive Restructuring – Is Ireland a leader in the EU?’ (YANIL Conference, Copenhagen, 24 September 2019). 36 Observations by Nicolaes Tollenaar at the ERA Conference in Trier, November 2019.

This is the 7th edition of this document.   23  processes) score highly,38 the UK a little less so. Cyprus as a common law country scored well below these figures.39  The Judiciary and Cross-border Insolvency Co-operation However, as the Project continued, and our engagement with members of the judiciary and the practising communities increased, more interesting questions arose. For the main part these focussed on the presence of any formal types of co-operation, the frequency of these issues arising in reality, and how the issue of co-operation or otherwise was pre-empted in a number of different ways. These developments will lead to a consideration of the obligations themselves in the body of this Report and whether there is actually any need for the imposition of formal obligations, such as those present in the EIR Recast. Chapter 5 of this Report highlights some of these issues through a discussion of case law which, in turn describes real commercial situations where these issues have arisen. As we progressed in our research, we realised the nature of co-operation in EU insolvency matters remains unclear. It seems that a lot of assumptions have been made regarding this matter which will be explored further as case law develops into the future. That said we are conscious of the fact that the EIR Recast (with its enhanced co-operation obligations) is a relatively new piece of legislation, dating back only 3 years from the time of the beginning of the project in 2018 and so perhaps it is too early to say what its real effects are, or indeed how these enhanced obligations to co-operate will be interpreted over time, particularly in the even newer context of a pan European preventive restructuring framework.   Co-Operation Guidelines, Examples, and Experience In keeping with our original research agenda (as indicated to the EU Commission DG Justice) we will also consider awareness of, and the application of, existing best practice guidelines for cooperation in cross-border insolvency cases. Chapter 6 will provide an account of these current existing guidelines on co-operation in cross-border insolvency cases, particularly those applicable in the European sphere. Chapter 6 will also explore how co-operation is envisaged under the UNCITRAL Model Law which includes provisions on co-operation that are similar to the EIR Recast. Chapters 5 and 8 of this Report will include information on judicial awareness and use of these guidelines gleaned from our engagement with members of the European judiciary through the Judicial Wing of INSOL Europe.40  38 Ibid at p. 45. In Ireland 30% rated judicial independence as very good with 70% as fairly good. In the UK these figures were 20% and 60% approximately. The Netherlands the figures were 25% and 73% approximately. Other common law countries such as Cyprus scored lower with 12% and just over 50% scoring very good and fairly good perception of judicial independence.  39 This is also interesting as Cyprus introduced a rescue procedure which is similar to Ireland’s examinership process which has been judged a failure.

The latter of these two aspects will mainly explore how coordination occurs often through bespoke protocols created on a case-by-case basis.  The final substantive Chapter 8 of this Report will present our findings of a survey distributed among three judicial focus groups in English, Italian, and Romanian. The purpose of this survey was to determine the experience of members of the European judiciary with both court-to-court cooperation in cross-border cases and their awareness and utilisation of the guidelines discussed in Chapter 6.41   The final Chapter will then offer our conclusions and reflections on the content of this Report.  Chapter 2: Transition The next Chapter will give an exposition of the European Insolvency Regulation- Recast 848/2015 applicable from 26 June 201742 developing from the original Regulation 1346/200043  It provides an explanation of the policy and regulatory framework within which the obligation placed on courts to co-operate arises.  It will focus in particular on the evolution of the co-operation obligations under both versions of the EIR, including how the EU views the meaning of judicial co-operation and what kinds of actions are expected or recommended in this area. These obligations will be examined in terms of both the recitals and the articles within which they are seated and how they developed between the two Regulations, along with a close analysis of the same provisions for corporate groups.       41 A copy of this survey distributed through domestic networks of our partner researchers UNIFI, who accessed an Italian network of insolvency judges, UTM who accessed those in the Romanian Magistracy having experience in hearing insolvency cases, and Ireland and through the Judicial Wing of INSOL Europe is attached in an Annex II to this Report.  42EIR Recast, art 92. 43 Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings [2000] OJ L 160/1.

Chapter 2: Court-to-court and Judicial Co-Operation in the European Union  2.1 Introduction to Chapter 2 In Chapter 3 of Report 1 we considered the evolution of the European Insolvency Regulation1 and the subsequent European Insolvency Regulation Recast (848/2015)2 from various conventions and discussions which had taken place since the 1960s in the context of further integrating the European Union. During those early decades, but particularly during the period immediately pre-ceding the adoption of the EIR Recast, the discussion between universalism and territorialism which had taken place in the United States academy sparked the interests of some academics on this side of the Atlantic.3 However, no EU policy documents proactively engage with this theoretical debate4 and it is clear that the incrementalist approach5 was adopted in the European Union, thereby avoiding a binary classification of approaches to issues of recognition and cooperation.  This Chapter will trace the evolution of the EIR Recast and, in particular, the evolution of the cooperation obligations. In doing so it will consider how the EU addresses what is meant by judicial cooperation and what kinds of action are envisaged. Section 2.2 is broken into three parts; first, the Chapter begins with a discussion of the EIR and considers its historical background and some of the factors that prompted its introduction. Th
