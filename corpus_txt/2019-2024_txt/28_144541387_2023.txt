However, the impact of the crisis on entrepreneurship and business dynamics differed amongst countries, depending on their businesses resilience, the policies implemented, but also their predominant productive structure. The magnitude and length of the Greek depression have no precedent among modern middle and high-income economies. Still, to date, there is no systematic analysis of the impact of the crisis on entrepreneurship and business dynamism. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining individual firm, sectoral and regional level characteristics that might affect existing firm resilience and new firm survival rate. We use two sources of data with the most extensive coverage of small (sole proprietorship) and large (other legal status firms) firms containing information on entry and exit in Greece. Matching data from patents and trademarks allow us to examine the interplay between entrepreneurship and innovation. Our analysis focuses on the factors that help or hinder firm survival and growth. We find that the crisis increased the exit likelihood for a firm by 5% to 16%. Larger firms, with significant fixed assets, lower financial leverage, operating in concentrated industries, but also those that are innovation and export oriented tend to have better chances of survival compared to their counterparts. These results are important for designing business policies not only in Greece but also other countries facing similar crises.    1 University of Cambridge, Cambridge Judge Business School, CEP & CEPR, E: c.genakos@jbs.cam.ac.uk  2 Athens University of Economics and Business, E: ikaplanis@aueb.gr 3 Athens University of Economics and Business & IOBE/FEIR 4 Laboratory of Industrial and Energy Economics, at the National Technical University of Athens & IOBE/FEIR 4  Keywords Entrepreneurship; business dynamism; innovation; crisis; policy; resilience.

Introduction Firm entry and exit are typically understood as part of what Schumpeter (1934) described as the "creative destruction" process through which older and less efficient firms exit the market and new and more efficient firms enter the market introducing new products and processes. This Darwinian process of dynamic competition is considered an important mechanism that makes markets more efficient and results in better consumer products and services. However, in times of severe economic distress, with collapsed demand and substantial economic uncertainty, this process may push out of the market even healthy or efficient firms leading to a weaker, not stronger, economy overall. The end result might be massive layoffs, rising levels of unemployment and poverty, as well as political turbulence. Which factors make firms resilient to a deep and sustained depression? Is there a role for public policy? In this paper, we study firm survival and growth by analysing one of the most acute downturn economic crises a country has suffered since the great depression. Greece experienced a significant boom between 1998 and 2007, with real GDP per capita growing by more than 30%, followed by a sustained depression, with real GDP per capita contracting by roughly 20% between 2007 and 2017 (Chodorow-Reich et al., 2021). The magnitude and length of the Greek depression have no precedent among modern middle and high-income economies. The severity is atypical even among economies experiencing sudden stops, sovereign defaults, or leverage cycles (Gourinchas et al., 2016). According to administrative data from the Ministry of Economy in Greece (GEMI), there were 106,000 firm closures and 38,000 openings at the crisis peak in 2011, resulting in an overall reduction of 6% of the total number of businesses in the economy. However, to date, there is no systematic analysis of the impact of the crisis on entrepreneurship and business dynamism, that has investigated the characteristics of these firms to identify patterns and possible causal links. This study attempts to fill this gap by examining individual firm, sectoral and regional level characteristics that might affect existing firm resilience and new firm survival rate. A significant contribution of the project is that the analysis is conducted at the firm level and utilises two valuable sources of data with the most extensive coverage of small (sole 6  proprietorship) and large (other legal status firms) firms containing information on entry and exit in Greece. We gathered microdata from the business registry of GEMI (“Greek General Commercial Registry”) for the period 2011-2019, a newly available source of information on the universe of businesses in Greece. To our knowledge, this is the first time the GEMI microdata have been processed and analysed to study individual firm resilience. Furthermore, we utilised microdata from the ICAP database, which contains financial and commercial information for all firms legally obliged to publish their economic accounts for the period 2004-2020, i.e. both before and after the crisis. We matched this microdata with information on industrial property rights, combining information on patents, industrial designs, and trademarks. The descriptive analysis offers valuable insights on the evolution of the Greek businesses performance before, during and after the crisis, investigating firm entry and exit by size, legal type, sector and region. Furthermore, applying suitable econometric techniques, we examine which firm characteristics – based on the available data - might be crucial to firm’s resilience and growth.  Our analysis focuses on the factors that help or hinder firm survival and growth. We find that the crisis increased the exit likelihood for a firm by 5% to 16%. Larger firms, with significant fixed assets, lower financial leverage, operating in concentrated industries, but also those that are innovation and export oriented tend to have better chances of survival compared to their counterparts. This is an important conclusion empirically supported by business demographics in Greece. Evidence on the role of such characteristics is important for policy makers not only for the Greek case and possible future policies per se but also for policymakers of other countries facing similar crises. Furthermore, it offers important business implications as it provides evidence for firms on how to strengthen their resilience and follow a strategy that can increase their chance of survival. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Data are presented in section 3, and the empirical framework in section 4. Section 5 presents first a descriptive analysis of the data and then the main results, alongside several robustness checks. Section 6 concludes. 7  2. Literature review The ability of firms to adopt to turbulent economic conditions and survive is a key factor for the economies to maintain jobs and households to maintain their incomes. Nevertheless, it is unavoidable that a portion of the firms will not succeed in surviving, and the firm entry and exit that takes place in a period of economic turbulence might serve to restructure the economy and its industries. According to estimates from a range of industries in several countries, approximately 5-10% of the firms exit the market over a single year (Agarwal and Gort, 2002). This paper follows and contributes to the extensive literature on business dynamics, firm entry and exit and their determinants (Geroski, 1995; Caves, 1998; Cefis and Marsili, 2006; Manjon-Antolin and Arauzo-Carod, 2008). Geroski (1995) offers an early survey of the empirical literature on firm entry and suggests that firm entry might be easier than its survival. Productivity and efficiency seem to affect the probability of survival to a great extent (Cefis and Marsili, 2006). The empirical literature on firm survival has focused on firm characteristics and industry characteristics as possible determinants for a firm's survival. The broad conclusion is that large and older firms perform better (Cressy, 2006; Dunne et al., 1989; Mata and Portugal, 1994). The better chances of larger and older firms for survival can be explained by learning models for industries such as the one developed by Jovanovic (1982), where efficient firms grow and survive. Their experience enables them to attract funding and adapt to new technologies and market needs.  Regarding size, numerous empirical studies find a positive relationship between size and the survival rate of firms (Mata and Portugal, 1994; Audretsch and Mahmood, 1995; Geroski, 1995; Sutton, 1997; Strotmann, 2007). Amongst other explanations, it has been proposed that sizeable firms have lower hazard rates as they tend to operate beyond their minimum efficient scale (Audretsch and Mahmood, 1995). Furthermore, they are also more likely to have more than one plant and thus reduce the risk of full exit in case some plants face difficulties and need restructuring (Esteve and Manez, 2008). On the other hand, there is an earlier proposition (Porter, 1979) that firms that occupy strategic niches in the market can still be successful in surviving, even if they are small. Agarwal and Audretsch (2001) reconcile this proposition with empirical evidence from the U.S. that shows that the relationship 8  between size and survival rates does not hold for mature or technologically intensive industries. Similarly, a number of authors find that the relationship is non-linear and either becomes insignificant beyond some level (Buehler et al., 2005) or weakens (Cefis and Marsili, 2005; Strotmann, 2007). Although, in general, firm age is positively related to firm survival, what is called the "liability of the newness" (Stinchcombe, 1965), there have been more nuanced approaches in the literature that, amongst others, suggest a non-linear relationship (Arauzo-Carod, 2008; Rossi, 2016). According to the proposition of the adolescence liability, the firm's hazard for exit increases and reaches its peak a few years after entry and then declines afterwards. Such a hazard increases once the firm has surpassed an initial “honeymoon period” that is fairly protected due to its initial funding and performance monitoring (Bruderl and Schussler, 1990; Fichman and Levinthal, 1991; Esteve and Manez, 2008; Rossi, 2016). But it has also been suggested that firms, as they become older, lose their ability to adapt to the changing environment and thus face increased risks for their survival, the so called “liability of senescence” (Baum, 1989; Hannah, 1998; Barron et al. 1996; Esteve and Manez, 2008). Other firm characteristics, such as the legal structure and ownership, have also been investigated for their relationship with firm survival (Harhoff et al., 1998; Mata and Portugal, 2002; Disney et al., 2003; Helmers and Rogers, 2010). Buehler et al. 2005 find that S.A. companies have greater chances to survive due to better funding access than limited liability companies. While Harhoff et al. (1998) find that limited liability corporations tend to have higher insolvency rates than full liability ones. Foreign ownership has also been examined, and the results are mixed. Some studies find a negative effect of foreign ownership on the survival rate (e.g. Gorg and Strobl, 2003; Esteve and Manez, 2007), while others do not estimate significant results (e.g. Mata and Portugal, 2002). Furthermore, empirical research has documented the lower hazard for exit for firms with high profitability (Audretsch and Mahmood, 1995; Esteve and Manez, 2008), high productivity (Ericson and Pakes, 1995; Melitz, 2003) and low debts (Fotopoulos and Louri, 2000a). Exporting activity has also been linked with firm survival as firms that compete in international 9  markets tend to be more resilient (Kimura and Fujii, 2003; Esteve et al., 2004; Buehler et al., 2005; Esteve and Manez, 2008). There is also a growing literature on the relationship between firm survival with innovation and technology advancement (Cefis and Marsili, 2005; see literature review by Ugur and Vivarelli, 2021), as well as firm’s human capital (Coleman et al., 2013; Saridakis et al. 2008; Rauch and Rijsdijk, 2013). The positive impact of innovation on firm survival has been empirically validated (Fontana and Nesta 2009; Cefis and Marsili 2005), but other studies find mixed results and recommend further research on the subject (Buddelmeyer et al., 2010; Børing 2015). Cefis and Marsili (2005) find an innovation premium for firms' chances of survival that arises mostly from process innovation rather than product innovation. Buddelmeyer et al. (2008) use patents and trademarks as proxies for innovation and find strong results for trademarks, while for patents, the positive relationship with survival rate applies only to incumbent firms. Firms that invest in R&D engage actively in articulating knowledge and thus face lower hazards for exit (Hall, 1987; Kimura and Fujii, 2003; Esteve and Manez, 2008). Another interesting research stream investigates the drivers of high-quality entrepreneurship since it appears to be more resilient to economic downturns and a crucial driver for economic development (Henrekson and Johansson 2010). Giotopoulos et al. (2017) conclude that the perception of business opportunities significantly affects high-quality entrepreneurship in adverse economic conditions, and the beneficial effects of educational attainment on growth intentions strengthen in times of crisis.  There is also important literature on how institutions might affect entrepreneurship (Acs, Desai and Hessels, 2008; Acs et al., 2018). The systematic literature analysis by Urbano et al. (2018) suggests that institutions could be related to economic growth through entrepreneurship. According to Williams and Vorley (2015), that conducted a series of interviews with entrepreneurs in Greece, institutional change during the crisis has deteriorated entrepreneurial activity. Furthermore, many researchers have investigated industry characteristics as firm survival determinants. Such elements are the technology intensity (Agarwal and Audretsch, 2001; Audretsch, 1995), the entry rate of new firms (Geroski, 1995; Segarra and Callejon, 2002) and 10  the life cycle of industries and businesses (Geroski, 1995; Mata et al., 1995). Some researchers have found that the level of industry concentration is related to a higher risk for firm survival due to the increased competition (Görg and Strobl, 2003; Audretsch, 1991), while others find industry concentration to be related positively to firm survival (Strotmann, 2007). Similarly, research on the innovation intensity of an industry and how it might affect firm survival, the results are mixed (Audretsch et al., 2000; Ugur and Vivarelli, 2020). For example, Audretsch and Mahmood (1995) research shows that firms entering highly innovative industries face a greater risk of exit. Still, this hazard decreases when the firm innovates as well (Audretsch, 1995). The importance of location factors and spatial proximity for firm performance has been proposed since the seminal work of Marshall (1920) on agglomeration economies and the recent boom of research on the subject (Jacobs, 1996; Fujita, Krugman and Venables, 1999). The work of Romer (1990) and Porter (1990) suggests that the contribution of industrial geographical concentration is key for knowledge spillovers and firm growth (Glaeser et al., 1992).  How knowledge spillovers influence regional new firm formation has been widely investigated (Lee et al., 2004; Acs and Armington, 2004), as well as the importance of innovation systems (Rodríguez-Pose and Crescenzi, 2008). Scholars have found that firms in urban centres have higher chances of survival (Stearns et al. 1995; Fotopoulos and Louri, 2000b;). However, other researchers have found a negative relationship for firm survival for urban areas (Keeble and Walker, 1994; Strotmann, 2007) or non-significant results (Audretsch and Vivarelli, 1995; Tsekouras et al., 2007).  Focusing on Greece, Kanellopoulos and Fotopoulos (2018) examine the effect of knowledge spillovers on new firm formation in manufacturing across Greek regions over the 2000s, finding a positive impact. Similarly, Vogiatzoglou and Tsekeris (2013) investigate the impact of knowledge spillovers on the spatial agglomeration of manufacturing. What is more, Daskalopoulou and Liargovas (2010) suggest that human capital and skilled labour are significant determinants of regional new firm establishment and stress the importance of specialisation in the manufacturing sector.  Earlier research includes Fotopoulos and Louri (2000a,b) studies on the importance of location for firm survival, examining the manufacturing sector in the 1980s and shedding light on the determinants of hazard confronting new entry. Besides the increased hazard for firms 11  established close to recession periods (Fotopoulos and Louri, 2000b), the role of foreign firms presence in increasing exit hazard and firm’s technical efficiency in mitigating it has also been documented (Louri et al., 2006). Finally, Dimara et al. (2008) study focuses on firms in the Greek food sector finding that high technical efficiency lowers the risk of exit. 3. Data  One of the main contributions of this paper is the combination of various interrelated datasets that are used for our analysis. First, we obtained data from the business registry of GEMI, the General Electronic Commercial Registry of Greece, which consists of the universe of Greek firms from 2011 until the first half of 2019. This dataset allows us to identify the establishment and exit year of every firm in Greece, as well as the main industry that the firm operates and its geographic location. Most importantly, this dataset allows for the observation and analysis of the behaviour of sole proprietorship firms, which are not available in any other data source. The main weakness of this administrative registry is that it does not contain any additional information or characteristics for these firms. Second, we obtain financial information for all the firms that are obliged by law to publish their yearly economic accounts in Greece from the ICAP Data Prisma firm database for 2004-2020. This is the most well-established source of firm level financial and commercial data information in Greece. It covers approximately 32,000 Greek companies5.  Third, we processed information on industrial property rights by combining data for patents, industrial designs (from the Hellenic Industrial Property Organization, which is the name for the Greek patent office) and trademark data (from the Secretariat for Trade and Consumer Protection). This exercise allowed us to measure the intangible capital of Greek firms for the first time and examine which of these categories of intellectual property rights contribute the most to firms' resilience.  Matching these three datasets was a challenging task, as there was no common firm identifier or unique identification code. The first step was the harmonisation and standardisation of key variables, such as the firm name, legal form and location variables, to overcome the inherent difficulties resulting from inconsistencies in spelling and  5 Access to the data was provided by IOBE, which is a licensed user of ICAP databases.  12  abbreviations, between the different datasets. The second step was based on  matching these key variables by using scoring functions and setting several criteria to ensure effectiveness. After the first matching attempt, several checks were applied to control for any matching variations. Therefore, there are two datasets that are mainly used in this paper. The first one contains basic information on all the sole proprietorship firms (2011-2019). We will refer to this as the SOLE dataset. The second and main dataset is a unique firm-level dataset for Greece that contains firm characteristics, financial information and industrial property rights (patents, trademarks and industrial designs) on all the firms that are obliged by law to publish economic information in Greece and spans the period 2004-2020, i.e. both before and after the crisis. We will refer to this as the ICAP dataset. 4. Empirical framework Our first part of the empirical analysis includes some descriptives to understand the main trends that emerge from the datasets. In this vein, we present various illustrative graphs to show the evolution of entry and exit across sectors and geography, and complement the evaluation by utilising the Kaplan–Meier (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) non-parametric estimator of survival analysis that is defined as follows: Ŝ(t) = ∏ni − d𝑖n𝑖i:t𝑖<𝑡 where 𝑖 = 1,2,… , 𝑘 indicates the different years of the examined period and 𝑛𝑖 is the number of businesses that are in operation for at t𝑖 years and are at risk at the time t𝑖, whereas d𝑖 indicates the number of firm exits that occur at t𝑖 starting from the first examined year.   The second part of the analysis consists of two econometric specifications related to modelling the survival of firms and firm growth. We first elaborate on how we model survival using a variety of econometric specifications. We then explore the firm growth determinants, including the crisis' impact. 13  4.1 Modelling survival To analyse firms' survival probability and its determinants, we estimate the following econometric framework: 𝑝𝑟(𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡)𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡 +𝛺𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡 + 𝛾𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 + 𝐹𝐸 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡    (1) where, 𝑒𝑥𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑡 is a binary indicator that takes the value of one the year 𝑡 that firm 𝑖 exits the market, 𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡 is a vector of firm characteristics (size, leverage, fixed assets, industrial property rights, age, exports, industry concentration), 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡  is a linear yearly trend, and 𝐹𝐸 are various fixed effects controlling for sectoral, regional or legal status firm characteristics. 𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡 is a binary indicator that, in its most general form, takes the value of one for the years 2009-2018, i.e. for the whole duration of the crisis in Greece. In addition, we also break up this variable into two periods, the first (2009-2014) and the second (2015-2018) period of the crisis, but also into three subperiods 2009-2011, 2012-2014 and 2015-2018 to test the severity of the crisis impact. Finally, 𝜀𝑖𝑡  is the error term that captures all unobserved determinants of the firm's exit decision. We estimate (1) using mainly a linear probability specification and calculate the standard errors based on a generalised White-like formula, allowing for firm-level clustered heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation (Bertrand et al., 2004). We also estimate a simple and a conditional fixed effects (FE) logit model. Although such a model is better suited to the binary dependent variable, it is not ideal for our purposes because the more appropriate firm FE logit model can be estimated only on the subsample of firms with variation in the exit variable, that is, those who exit from the market during the period in which we observe them. This sample is non-representative and would overestimate the actual marginal effect of the independent variables. We provide these results to show the qualitative robustness of our results. Finally, we also use a proportional hazard model (PHM) for the duration between the time a firm enters and exits the market. We estimate (1) utilising a semiparametric estimation procedure that allows for time-varying independent variables (Cox, 1972). According to the Cox PHM, the hazard function is decomposed into two multiplicative components: ℎ𝑖(𝑡, 𝑋𝑖) =ℎ0(𝑡) × 𝜆𝑖, where 𝜆𝑖 ≡ exp⁡(𝛽′𝑋𝑖). The ℎ0(𝑡) is the baseline hazard function that models the dynamics of the probability of switching (hazard rate) over time; 𝑋𝑖 is a vector of individual 14  characteristics, and β is a vector of regression coefficients that includes the intercept; 𝜆𝑖 scales the baseline hazard proportionally to reflect the effect of the covariates based on the underlying firm heterogeneity. The main advantage of the PHM is that it accounts for censoring and is flexible enough to allow for both time-invariant (e.g., indicator variables for industrial property rights or exporting) and time-varying control variables (e.g., leverage or firm age). 4.2 Modelling firm growth  To analyse firms' growth and its determinants, we estimate the following econometric specification: ∆𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑡 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐶𝑟𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑠𝑡 + 𝛾𝛺𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡−1 + 𝛾𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑑𝑡 + 𝐹𝐸 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡            (2) where now the left-hand side is the growth in sales, ∆𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑡 ,⁡of firm 𝑖 in year 𝑡, and the only difference with specification (1) is that 𝑋𝑖𝑠𝑡−1  contains a number of firm characteristics in lagged form. We estimate (2) using OLS and cluster the standard errors again at the firm level, allowing for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation.  5. Results 5.1 Descriptive analysis ICAP dataset We first look at some descriptive statistics from the ICAP dataset. Following the literature, we assume that entry takes place in the first year that a firm publishes financial statements, and the entry rate compares new firms to the population of active firms in the examined year. Similarly, we assume that exit takes place the last year that the firm publishes financial statements and appears as "inactive" in the dataset.6 The exit rate is estimated as the ratio of the firms that exited over the total active firms in the examined year. Although the entry and exit rates tend to be correlated over periods of boom and bust, this has not been the case during the period of the peak of the crisis (2010-2013). In 2011, the  6 ICAP characterizes firms as active or not on the date of the data extraction. When the firm’s status is “active”, we do not consider it an exit even if there are missing values from the sample for consecutive years.   15  entry rate reached its lowest level at 5.6%, halved compared to 2007, while the exit rate reached 4.8%, a rise of 23% compared to 2006. As we can see in Figure 1, exit and entry rates are correlated at a rate of 46.2%, and the exit rate responsiveness is relatively flatter compared to the firm entry’s one. The entry rate in 2004 is equal to 8.3%, while the exit is below 4.0% (3.7%). The entry peak took place in 2007 at a rate of 11.3%, reaching its lowest value in 2011 (5.6%). Afterwards, gradual recovery began reaching its highest point in 2017 (9.1%), though it was below the percentage of 2007. On the other hand, exit rate variations were smoother than the entry ratio. In 2004 we started with a 3.7% exit ratio extending to 4.8% in 2011, while a slow decrease followed (in 2017, the exit level was 4.1%). Dropping and rising of entrepreneurial entry acts as a signal of economic downturn and growth correspondingly.  FIGURE 1 - ENTRY AND EXIT RATES, ICAP (2004-2020)  Notes: Entry (exit) rate is defined as the ratio of the number of new (closed) firms over the total number of firms in the ICAP database each respective year.  At the regional level (Figure 2), full recovery within the region is evident in only a handful of regions (Thessaly, South Aegean, Ionian Islands, Crete, Central Greece), that their post-crisis (2017-2019) entry rates exceeded their pre-crisis (2004-2008) entry rates.  Furthermore, it was only the regions of Western Greece, Thessaly, Epirus, Central Macedonia and Attica that achieved more than an 8% entry rate in the 2017-2019 period. As expected in most regions during the economic depression, the entry rate reached its lowest point.

In Epirus, the entry ratio was 11.3% on average similar to Western Greece (11.0%). Peloponnese's entry percentage was equal to 10.4%, higher to the following years (6.9% and 7.2% for 2009-2016 and 2017-2019, respectively). During the crisis, from 2009 to 2016, Attica (4.6%), Central Macedonia (3.9%), Central Greece (3.6), Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (3.5%) and Western Greece (3.9%) were hit greater concerning business exit from the market. However, the highest exit rates were observed in Attica (4.8%) and in Central Macedonia (5.0%) in the period of Greek economic bloom (2004-2008).  Surprisingly, in many regions, the exit rate in the 2004-2008 period was significantly higher than in the recession years (2009-2016), such as Western Macedonia, Thessaly, Peloponnese and Eastern Macedonia and Thrace.

The region categories refer to the NUTS2 classification regarding the location of firms.  Next, we examine the entry and exit rates concerning the firm's financial size (Figure 3). The size is defined according to sales amount in each examined year, and it is divided into four categories a) less than € 2 million, b) € 2-10 million, c) € 10-50 million, and d) more than € 50 million of sales. Both entry and exit rates are with respect to the total active firms of each year.  The smaller firms group dominates entry rates. The entry rate has recovered fully on average, comparing the periods of 2017-2019 and 2004-2008 (8.3% on average for both periods).  Still, medium and larger firms' performance is significantly lower compared to the boom of the Greek economy. The economy of Greece consists mostly of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) since their share is 99.9% (OECD, 2020). Especially, the presence of companies with turnover greater than € 50 million is almost negligible compared to the total of firms. Their entry rate during the 2017-2019 period was 0.01%, while in 2004-2008, it was 0.11%. Smaller firms exited the market at a greater rate than the rest of the categories. The exit rate of medium and larger firms is significantly inferior compared to the first sample years. 0.0% 1.0% 2.0% 3.0% 4.0% 5.0% 6.0%AtticaCentral GreeceCentral MacedoniaCreteEastern Macedonia, ThraceEpirusIonian IslandsNorth AegeanPeloponneseSouth AegeanThessalyWestern GreeceWestern MacedoniaExit rate per region for 2004-2008, 2009-2016, 2017-2019, comparison within the region 2017-2019 2009-2016 2004 -200818  The exit rate of smaller firms, having turnover of less than € 2 million, was higher in 2004-2008 on average (3.4%) but close to the crisis period (3.3%). Their exit rate dropped in 2017-2019, which was 2.8%. The results are quite similar for the medium-sized companies in 2004-2008 and 2009-2016 period (0.6%, 0.5% and 0.1%, 0.1% for firms with € 2-10 and € 10 – 50 million of sales correspondingly). In the 2017-2019 period, the exit ratio was even lower.  Looking at the within variation in each size category, the smallest firms exhibit the higher entry rates; while the size increases, the entry rate decreases. Their performance before the economic recession was 11.4% when during the crisis, it dropped to 8.3%, and it increased again to 10.2% during 2017-2019. For medium firms (2-10 million euros turnover), the entry rate never returned to its post-crisis performance since it dropped from 4.0% to 0.8% for the last two years examined. The behaviour of larger firms follows a similar pattern. Regarding exit rates, each size category follows a different path. For small firms with a turnover of less than two million, the exit rate is greater during the booming economic period of 2004-2008 (4.6%). During the crisis, it dropped to 4.2%, and it decreased further for the 2017-2019 period to 3.4%. Next, firms with sales of 2-10 million euros exited the market with a rate equal to 2.9%, 3.2%, and 1.7% for the three periods examined, respectively. As far as businesses with 10-50 million euros are concerned, the post and during crisis exit ratio was equal to 2.7%, and after the end of the recession, it declined to 1.5%. Lastly, 2.3% of large firms with more than 50 million euros turnover ceased operation before 2009-2016 and 2.6% of them during the aforementioned period. After the crisis, this ratio dropped to 0.9%.  19  FIGURE 3 – ENTRY AND EXIT RATES BY FIRM SIZE   Notes: Entry (exit) rate is defined as the ratio of the number of new (closed) firms over the total number of firms in the ICAP database each respective year. Firms are divided into four categories with respect to their turnover a) “More than € 50 million” represents firms with turnover over 50 million euros, “€ 10-50 million” represents firms with turnover between the 10-50 million euros, “€ 2-10 million” represents firms with turnover between the 2-10 million euros, and “Less than € 2 million” represents firms with turnover less than two million euros. The presented rates are the averages of the entry (exit) rates for the periods 2004-2008, 2009-2016, and 2017-2019.    0.0% 1.0% 2.0% 3.0% 4.0%Less than € 2 million€ 2-10 million€ 10-50 millionMore than € 50 millionExit rate by financial size with respect to the total economic activity2017-2019 2009-2016 2004 -20080.0% 2.0% 4.0% 6.0% 8.0%10.0%Less than € 2 million€ 2-10 million€ 10-50 millionMore than € 50 millionEntry rate by financial size with respect to the total economic activity2017-2019 2009-2016 2004 -20080.0% 2.0% 4.0% 6.0%Less than € 2 million€ 2-10 million€ 10-50 millionMore than € 50 millionExit rate by financial sizecomparison within each category2017-2019 2009-2016 2004 -20080.0% 5.0% 10.0% 15.0%Less than € 2 million€ 2-10 million€ 10-50 millionMore than € 50 millionEntry rate by financial sizecomparison within each category2017-2019 2009-2016 2004 -200820  The entry rates in the tertiary sector during 2017-2019 (7.1%) exceeded the 2004-2008 period (6.2%) on average, and they occupy the largest share compared to the other sectors. Although the secondary sector has recovered slightly compared to 2009-2016, the entry rate is still inferior to the first four examined years. After the crisis period, the primary sector increased its share in entries (from 0.1% to 0.2%) but still is a small part of the total economy. The primary economy’s within sector variation demonstrates a remarkable performance in the post-crisis period, almost doubling its entry rate, from 5.0% during 2004-2008 to 9.7% during 2017-2019. On the contrary, the secondary sector's within variation indicates an inferior entry share for the last two examined years (6.5%) compared to the initial period (9.2%).  The highest exit rate is evident in the tertiary sector during the crisis years (2009-2016) (3.2%), while for the same period, the secondary and the primary sector exited the market with a lower rate (1.1% and 0.1%, respectively). Before the crisis, the exit rate for the tertiary was lower, while for the secondary and the primary sector, it was at similar levels. Regarding the exit rate variation within the sector, the picture is quite similar to the entry rates' description with the opposite sign. The primary sector's exit rate, measured in comparison with its own shares, decreased among the examined periods on average. For the secondary sector, the rate before and during the crisis was at similar levels, and for the tertiary sector, the exit rate was higher during the crisis.  21   Notes: Entry (exit) rate is defined as the ratio of the number of new (closed) firms over the total number of active firms in the ICAP database each respective year. We adopt the NACE (Nomenclature of Economic Activities) standard classification. The analysis refers to the first digit NACE classification, which includes 21 sectors identified by alphabetical letters A to U. The Primary sector is defined as the A and B sections, the Secondary Sector ranges from C to F, and the Tertiary Sector is G to Q, and the rest of them belong to the category of Other Services.

Private company status dominated the entry rates in the last two examined years with a rate of 6.8%, followed by Public Limited Companies with a significantly smaller ratio equal to 1.2%. The great entry share of Private companies could be attributed to the introduction of the law 4072/20127. During the economic recession, again, Private Companies entered the market in a higher proportion (2.7%), with the second most popular legal type being Limited Liability Companies (2.0%). In the booming period, Public Limited Companies were the most popular ones, with a share reaching 4.8%, and Limited Liability Company status ranked again second in preference (3.0%). The majority of the exit share, on average, belonged to the Public Limited Company legal status for all the examined years. For Limited Liability Companies, the exit percentages for the examined periods were, on average, 1.1% and 1.4%, dropping after the crisis to 0.7%. In 2017-2019 Private Companies exiting reached 1.1%. Examining the variation inside the legal categories, 8.6% of active Limited Liability Companies closed on average in 2004-2008, while the ratios for Public Limited Companies, General Partnership Companies, and Limited Partnerships Companies were inferior (3.5%, 3.1% and 1.7%). Only for Limited Partnership and Private Companies, the exit rate in 2009-2016 was greater than the booming period (3.1% and 1.6%). Whereas the exit rate for the Private Companies after the crisis was 4.4% larger than any other category.   7 According to the explanatory statement of law 4072/2012 and given that the majority of Greek businesses are small and medium; it was necessary to introduce a new corporate form which would disconnect the firm’s capital from the entrepreneur’s wealth, facilitate quick start-up and be as flexible as possible. In this context, the form of “private company”.   23  FIGURE 4  - ENTRY AND EXIT RATES BY LEGAL STATUS   Notes: Entry (exit) rates are defined as the rate of new (closed) firms of each category towards the total of the firms in ICAP in its respective year and each respective category. The Public Limited stands for the Greek company type “Ανώνυμη Εταιρεία – ΑΕ”, Limited Partnership stands for “Ετερόρρυθμη Εταιρεία - ΕΕ”, Limited Liability is the “Εταιρεία Περιορισμένης Ευθύνης – ΕΠΕ”, Private is the “Ιδιωτική Κεφαλαιουχική Εταιρεία – ΙΚΕ”, and General Partnership is the “Ομόρρυθμη Εταιρεία - ΟΕ”.

From the sample's new firms, the interval with the highest share of failed firms was 1-2 years of operation, equalling 17.9%, while 53.8% of the failed new firms of the sample ended their operation in their first three years. After ten years of operation, the failed ratio decreases significantly to 2.8% and drops even further in the following year intervals, demonstrating the effect of age on survival rate.  First, we assess the survival rates of firms depending on the period of their market entry. We divide the examined periods in 2004-2008, the booming period before the deep recession, and the crisis into two periods 2009-2012 and 2013-2016. The last period is the three-years 2017-2019, after the crisis. The difference in survival between the different categories was statistically significant using the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 63722, Pr>χ2=.000). The period that new firms were less resilient was the first four years of the crisis. In contrast, the most resilient cohort for the first three years was those established in 2017-2019.   Notes: The graphs present the Kaplan – Meier survival estimates for new firms that entered the market after 2004. The “New 2004-2008” represents the new firms established between 2004-2008, “New 2009-2012” represents the new firms established between 2009-2012, “New 2013-2016” represents the new firms established between 2013-2016, and “New 2017-2019” represents the new firms established between 2017-2019. 0.600.801.000 5 10 15analysis timeKaplan-Meier survival estimateFIGURE 5 - KAPLAN-MEIER SURVIVAL RATE FOR FIRMS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN 2004-2020 IN TOTAL AND BY ECONOMIC PERIOD 0.600.801.000 5 10 15analysis timeNew 2004-2008 New 2009-2012New 2013-2016 New 2017-2019Kaplan-Meier survival estimates25  Next, we examine the survival rates by looking at the NUTS1 regional categorisation. The difference in survival between the different regions was statistically significant using the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 62221, Pr>χ2=0.000). The region with the highest survival rate of firms established after 2004 was the Aegean Islands and Crete, whereas the Attica region, the region with the highest share of firms, was the less resilient at the NUTS1 level.                Notes: The graphs present the Kaplan – Meier survival estimates for new firms that entered the market after 2004 with respect to their location. Regions are represented at the NUTS1 level.  In the sectorial level survival rates, the difference in survival between the different sectors was statistically significant using the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 61225.47, Pr>χ2=0,0000). The primary sector was the most resilient during the examined period, whereas the tertiary sector demonstrated an inferior rate. The primary sector includes NACE A and B sectors, the secondary sector is the C to F NACE categories, and the tertiary is the G to Q. Other services include the R and S categories representing the arts, entertainment, and other services sectors.

We adopt the NACE (Nomenclature of Economic Activities) standard classification. The analysis refers to the first digit NACE classification, which includes 21 sectors identified by alphabetical letters A to U. The Primary sector is defined as the A and B sections, the Secondary Sector ranges from C to F, and the Tertiary Sector is G to Q, and the rest of them belong to the category of other services. The right graph presents the most and the less resilient sector during the examined period.   From the legal status perspective, rates of the variation in endurance between the different legal statuses were statistically significant by applying the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1)=57427, Pr>χ2=0.000). The type of General Partnership Company was the top one in the Kaplan-Meier estimations, followed closely by the Limited Partnership category. On the contrary, Limited Liability Companies demonstrated the smallest-scale rate with a significant difference from the rest types. Private companies were in the middle of estimations, and Public Limited Companies ranked second last. The difference in financial size is statistically significant according to the the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 66335, Pr>χ2=0.000).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           0.600.801.000 5 10 15analysis timeOther Sectors Public Admin.Real EstateKaplan-Meier survival estimates0.600.801.000 5 10 15analysis timeOther services Primary SectorSecondary Sector Tertiary SectorKaplan-Meier survival estimates27          Notes: The graphs present the Kaplan – Meier survival estimates for new firms that entered the market after 2004 with respect to their legal status. The Public Limited stands for the Greek company type “Ανώνυμη Εταιρεία – ΑΕ”, Limited Partnership stands for “Ετερόρρυθμη Εταιρεία - ΕΕ”, Limited Liability is the “Εταιρεία Περιορισμένης Ευθύνης – ΕΠΕ”, Private is the “Ιδιωτική Κεφαλαιουχική Εταιρεία – ΙΚΕ”, and General Partnership is the “Ομόρρυθμη Εταιρεία - ΟΕ”.   Companies with greater financial size (more than € 50 million) in the first nine years seem to have a significant advantage relating to survivability, while medium firms (2-10 million) after a decade appear more resilient according to the Kaplan-Meier estimates. Through the period examined, firms with the lowest survival rates belonged to the €10-50 million category, while small firms were in the middle of the ranking approximately. The size in this category is the first year’s turnover as the firm entered the market.  0.600.801.000 5 10 15analysis timeGeneral Partnership Limited LiabilityLimited Partnership PrivatePublic LimitedKaplan-Meier survival estimatesFIGURE 8 - KAPLAN-MEIER SURVIVAL RATE FOR FIRMS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN 2004-2020 BY LEGAL STATUS 28     Notes: The graphs present the Kaplan – Meier survival estimates for new firms that entered the market after 2004 with respect to their financial size. Firms are divided into four categories with respect to their turnover “More than € 50 million” represents firms with turnover over 50 million euros, “€ 10-50 million” represents firms with turnover between the 10-50 million euros, “€ 2-10 million” represents firms with turnover between the 2-10 million euros, and “Less than € 2 million” represents firms with turnover less than two million euros.   The industrial property also enhances the survival probability. To examine whether having any of the examined Intellectual Property Rights (Patents, Trademarks, and Industrial Designs - IPRs) increases the resilience of firms, we estimate the survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier estimator process. Having any kind of IPRs increases the survival rate significantly, as the estimators demonstrate and by applying the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 66334, Pr>χ2=0.000). Patents and Trademarks enhance the survival rate clearly, though the results for industrial designs are ambiguous.     0.600.801.000 5 10 15analysis timeLess than €2 Mill.

The only available data source for this type of ownership is the SOLE which covers their universe. The entry and exit years in this data are defined directly from the registry’s data. The rate compares new/closed firms to active Sole-Proprietorship firms in the examined year. When compared, exit and entry rates are correlated during the periods of boom and bust at a rate equal to 92.9%. The entry rate in 2012 equals 5.3% though the exit rate is at 6.6%. The year with the highest entry rate is 2013 (5.4%), while the exit percentage starts from its maximum value in 2012. From 2013 to 2015, the entry rate was greater than the exit rate, but the opposite took place from 2016-2017. In 2018 the exit rate is at its lowest value (2.2%), similarly to the entry share (2.9%).   FIGURE 11 - SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP: ENTRY AND EXIT RATES IN GREECE FOR 2012-2018  Notes: Entry (exit) rates are defined as the ratio of new (closed) firms over the total of the active firms in the SOLE database each respective year.   0.0%1.0%2.0%3.0%4.0%5.0%6.0%7.0%2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018entry rate exit rate31  Attica and Central Macedonia were the leading regions regarding both entry and exit rates, and the differences to the rest of the regions were quite considerable. Entry rates decreased through 2012-2018 for all regions in Greece. In 2015 an extra shock for Greece's economy took place due to the imposition of capital controls. Therefore, we use this cut off point to analyse the regional dimension by splitting the annual rates before and after the shock using a three-year average. The highest entry rate was observed in Attica during the 2012-2014 period (1.8%), while Central Macedonia firms entered the market at a rate of 0.9% during the same period.  For the rest of the regions, increased rates were observed in Thessaly, Crete and Western Greece. Before the imposition of Capital Controls, Thessaly was leading the rest of the regions with an entry rate equal to 0.3%, while in 2015, Cretan businesses entered the market with the highest share of 0.2%. The lower entry percentages for every examined period were in North Aegean, Western Macedonia and Epirus, but the largest ratio among them was the Epirus entry rate in 2012-2014, equal to 0.1%.  Regarding the market exits, the results are somehow different. Contrary to the decreasing entry rates in many regions, the exit rates increased for some regions after the 2015 shock. Attica's shares for the three examined periods were 1.6%, 0.9%, and 1.1%, correspondingly. In Central Macedonia, the exit rate before 2015 was 1.1% and remained at 0.6% for 2015 and 2016-2018. Concerning the rest of the regions, Thessaly, Crete, Western Greece, and South Aegean were the only regions after 2012-2014 that demonstrated an exit rate higher than 0.2%. At the same time, entries with the lowest values were again observed in North Aegean, Western Macedonia and Epirus, where exiting after 2012-2014 was less than 0.1%.    32    Notes: Entry (exit) rate is defined as the ratio of the number of new (closed) firms over the total number of active firms in the SOLE database each year in the respective category. The presented rates are the averages of the entry (exit) rates for the periods 2004-2008, 2009-2016, and 2017-2019.

The higher entry rate for the tertiary sector is demonstrated in 2012-2014 (1.3%), while in 2015, it was equal to 0.9%, and in 2016-2018 it dropped further at a rate of 0.6%. The primary sector entry ratio was 0.5% in 2012-2014, while for the rest of examined periods remained constant at 0.4%. The entry of the secondary sector for the sole traders was negligible. Examining the within sector variation, the primary sector ranged from 44.4% to 34.0% for 2012-2014 and 2016-2018, correspondingly. For the tertiary sector, the entry rate before the capital controls was 2.7% for the sector's firms, which decreased further in the following years.  The average exit rate for the tertiary sector in 2012-2014 was 2.2%. During the capital controls, it fell to 1.1% and remained similar on average for the following years. For the primary sector, the exiting was 0.5%, and in 2012-2014, it declined further in the following years. Similarly, in entry years, the secondary sector's presence was negligible. Large within sector variation was evident in the primary sector, where the exit rate in 2012-2014 reached 45.4%, which dropped in 2015 to 23.8% and increased slightly in 2016-2018 to 24.9%.   34    Notes: Entry (exit) rate is defined as the ratio of the number of new (closed) firms over the total number of active firms in the SOLE database each year in the respective category. We adopt the NACE (Nomenclature of Economic Activities) standard classification. The statistics here are presented in the first level, which includes 21 sections identified by alphabetical letters A to U. The Primary sector is defined as the A and B sections, the Secondary Sector ranges from C to F, and the Tertiary Sector is G to Q, and the rest of them belong to the category of other services.

Approximately 23.0% of Sole-Proprietorship firms introduced in the market between 2011 to half of 2019 closed until the first half of 2019 (Table A8). From the new firms of the SOLE, the interval with the highest share of failed firms was the 1-2 years of operation, equalling 27.5%, while 64.9% of the failed new firms of the sample ended their operation in the first two years of their operation. After seven years of operation, the failed ratio decreases significantly to 1.7%, indicating the impact of age on the survival rate.  The survival rates of firms depend on the period of their market entry based on the year intervals, similar to the previous section. The survival rates of new firms established in 2012-2014 and 2015 are quite similar. The most resilient period was 2016-2018. The difference in survival between the different categories was statistically significant using the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 210592, Pr>χ2=0.000).   Notes: The graphs present the Kaplan – Meier survival estimates for new firms that entered the market after 2011. The “New 2012-2014” represents the new firms established between 2012-2014, “New 2015” represents the new firms established in 2005, and “New 2016-2018” represents the new firms established between 2016-2018.  At the NUTS1 regional level, the difference in survival between the different regions was statistically significant using the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 257375, Pr>χ2=0.000). The region with the highest survival rate of firms established after 2011 was the Aegean Islands and Crete.

The results are comparable to the other legal forms examined in the ICAP dataset.   Notes: The graphs present the Kaplan – Meier survival estimates for new firms that entered the market after 2011 with respect to their location. Regions are represented at the NUTS1 level.   In the sectorial level survival rates, the difference in survival between the different sectors was statistically significant using the Log-Rank Test (χ2(1) = 235390, Pr>χ2=0.000). The primary sector was the most resilient during the examined period, whereas the tertiary sector demonstrated a poorer rate. From the first level of NACE categories, the most resilient through the eight years examined was the sector of Agriculture. The sector with the lesser survivability was the domain of Public Administration, similarly to the ICAP dataset.   0.600.801.000 2 4 6 8analysis timeAegean islands-Crete AtticaCentral Greece Northern GreeceKaplan-Meier survival estimatesFIGURE 15
