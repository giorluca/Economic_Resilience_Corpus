Box 10, KualaLumpur, 50728, MalaysiaAbstractIn the past, there has been a preponderance of studies on entrepreneurs or small and medium enterprises (SMEs) inMalaysia; however, very few studies concentrated on women entrepreneurs. Women entrepreneurs are known to bepersistent and resilient in running their business. However, it may be interesting to focus on factors or componentsthat contribute towards their resiliency. Hence, this study explores the critical components of entrepreneurialresiliency which play a significant role in the business survival of women entrepreneurs during and after undergoingeconomic crises. The term resilience comprises three components, namely hardiness, resourcefulness, and optimism.Hardiness refers to adaptive capacity, and not easily discouraged by failures. Resourcefulness, on the other hand,relates to cash flow, investment, relational networks, material assets, and the ability to adapt to changes, whileoptimism means the preparedness to make decisions, take action, and the ability to see the humorous side of things.The sample of the study consisted of 100 women entrepreneurs, mainly food operators in Klang Valley who wereselected randomly. Most of the women entrepreneurs were aged above 30 years, and more than half have more than10 years’ experience in running their business. A set of questionnaire with items on entrepreneurial resilience and itscomponents-hardiness, resourcefulness, and optimism-was used to gain information among women entrepreneurs.The findings show that the most critical components for resilience during crises was resourcefulness, while optimismemerged as the most important component after undergoing crises. © Asian Academy of Management and PenerbitUniversiti Sains Malaysia, 2019.SciVal Topic Prominence Topic: Prominence percentile: 98.613Author keywordsHardiness Optimism Resilience Resourcefulness Women entrepreneurs◅ Back to results Export  Download  Print  E-mail  Save to PDF ⋆ Add to List  ▻More...View at PublisherOpen AccessAsian Academy of Management JournalVolume 24, 2019, Pages 111-126Abdul Rani, N.S.a  Krishnan, K.S.a Suradi, Z.b Juhdi, N.c abc View references (27)Internationalization | SMEs | Born globalsISSN: 13942603Source Type: JournalOriginal language: EnglishDOI: 10.21315/aamj2019.24.s2.8Document Type: ArticlePublisher: Penerbit Universiti Sains MalaysiaPlumX MetricsUsage, Captures, Mentions,Social Media and Citationsbeyond Scopus.Metrics Cited by 0 documentsInform me when this documentis cited in Scopus: Related documents(2016) Asian Journal of Women'sStudies, (2018) IOP Conference Series:Materials Science andEngineering, (2017) Southeast Asia and China:A contest in mutual socialization Find more related documents inScopus based on:❓  ▻View all metricsSet citation alert ▻ ▻Set citation feedPersonal journey of developmentthrough the Gender Responsiveand Participatory Budgeting(GRPB) project, PenangHusin, N.H.Evaluation of the wind pumpedhydropower storage integratedflood mitigation system Safi, A.
