Introduction  The Covid-19 Pandemic is still overshadowing the Indonesian economy. The increasing number of Covid-19 new variant infection cases in July 2022 (Wamad, 2022) indicated that the transformation of the pandemic to endemic has not been achieved yet (Aditama, 2022; Putra & Wayoi, 2022). Travel restriction policy, especially for passengers of long-distance transportation modes like airplanes and trains, is predicted to retard the economy again as it was in 2020 (Al Faqir, 2020).  Moreover, the global economic recession due to war, and rising commodity prices, especially food and energy prices, also affected the Indonesian national and regional economy (Agustin & Edhie, 2022). This condition requires crisis-sensitive public policies and regional development planning focused on strategic sectors.  (Anbumozhi et al., 2022) emphasized the importance of enhancing the link between global dynamics and the multifaceted local reality, improving policy coherence, and providing a strategic option to strengthen regional’s bargaining power internationally.  The regional development planning in the (post) pandemic stage consequently adjusts the new normal consumer behavior in fulfilling their daily needs. In the West Java context, (Laksana, 2021) has claimed that electricity infrastructure and telecommunications network development are strategic in regional development during and after the pandemic. The availability of energy (especially electricity) and telecommunication facilities are two of the main pillars of the economy in the new-normal era (less contact economy) onward the development of a virtual (Internet of Things/ IoT) lifestyle. (Mulyaman & Rahmani, 2021) concluded that internet access is becoming a new trait of citizens’ welfare.  However, researchers found that the electricity and telecommunication infrastructure development in West Java is inequitable, especially between the Northern and the Southern areas and between rural and urban areas. Local policymakers' awareness of opportunities and challenges for infrastructure investment in the energy and telecommunication sector is urgently needed (Maqin, 2014). In the post-pandemic era, Infrastructure constraints in remote areas in Indonesia encourage more people to migrate to urban areas (Nurwaesari et al., 2022). On the other hand, research examining investor interest in developing the West Java energy and telecommunication infrastructure has been rare. In addition, the regional investment policy and the electricity and telecommunication development plan still need to be Figured out to complete the puzzle pieces of the big picture question: How to Cope with Strategic Infrastructure Disparities in West Java? Based on the background, this paper aims to: 1) identify the electrical energy access of households and the existing condition of telecommunication infrastructure; 2) conFigure the investment data in the last five years, and 3) analyze the opportunities and challenges of investment, development of electricity, and development of telecommunication network in the future. It formulates policy recommendations to the West Java Provincial Government and Regencies / Municipalities in West Java on the orientation of electric power and telecommunications network development to face economic challenges in the (post) pandemic era as well as to cope with interregional development disparities.  2. Methodology This paper is qualitative research that uses the Desk Study method. It analyzes primary data collected from competent bureaucrats and secondary as open datasets, laws, and regulations downloaded from Governments’ official websites, as well as papers downloaded from scientific journal publications and news from the mass media. Primary data collection was carried out at the end of July 2022 by semi-structured interviews with twelve competent bureaucrats in the Regional Offices: the Energy and Mineral Resources Office (Dinas ESDM), the Investment and One-Stop Integrated Service Office (Dinas PMPTSP), the Community Empowerment Service, and Villages Office (Dinas PemDes), as well as the Communication and Information Office (Dinas KomInfo). It was followed by a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) online through the Zoom meeting media at the end of August 2022 involving twenty participants.  Secondary data collection was conducted from July to August 2022 by downloading datasets and references from: https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/ https://bps.go.id  and https://jdih.jabarprov.go.id/.   The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022   224                                                                               Laksana et al  In addition, this research also collected papers downloaded from scientific journal publisher websites and news from online mass media.  Furthermore, primary data from interviews and FGD were processed descriptively to produce policy recommendations. Meanwhile, the secondary data from official websites were processed using descriptive statistics to provide informative Tables and graphs. The results were presented in a deductive narrative to answer the research questions.  3. Results and Discussions  Energy is an essential factor in daily life. One of which is electricity as a primary type of energy that supports human activities, including activities on the internet and telecommunications networks. A total blackout that occurred on August 4, 2019, then almost repeated at the end of October 2020 (Akhir, 2020), gave a lesson about how highly dependent human life is on electrical energy. The first total blackout, on August 4, 2019, was due to the disruption of the 500kV transmission in Ungaran. The State Electricity Company (PLN) cut off the electricity for several hours in the DKI Jakarta, West Java, and Banten areas affecting 21 million customers. It caused the paralysis of public transportation, telecommunications, water supply, and traffic. Hence, the sustainability of the electric power supply is vital for life today and in the future. The indicator of electrical energy access of households in an area is the Electrification Ratio. The Indonesian Electrification Ratio in the third quarter of 2021 was 99.4%. The percentage spatially varies across regions, where only nine provinces have a ratio above 99.7%, one of which was West Java. The Electrification Ratio of West Java was 99.72 percent in 2021 (Dinas ESDM, 2022). It means that there were still 28 of ten thousand households in remote areas (approximately 260,000 Households) who could not access the electrical power supply, either from PLN or others. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the electrification ratio of Regencies/Municipalities in West Java. The darker-colored indicates a lower Electrification Ratio than the lighter-colored region.   Figure 1. The West Java Electrification Ratio, 2021 (Dinas ESDM, 2022)   The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022                                                                                                                                     Laksana et al 225                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Electrification Ratio in an area is closely related to the development of electricity infrastructure in that area. (Maqin, 2014) concluded that electricity infrastructure is a significant factor in economic development in the sub-Provincial administration of West Java. His study concluded that although the condition of West Java's electricity infrastructure looks better than in previous years, the available electricity supply has not been able to keep up with the electricity demand, especially for productive electricity consumption and electricity needs in remote areas. The electric power supply is a substantial production factor for the industry which is the prominent contributors to the West Java Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, it tends to be scattered in the Northern region, indicating the economic disparity between North and South of the West Java economy. Apart from the electricity infrastructure, factors influencing the inequality of the Electrification Ratio in Indonesia are income and geographic location of residence (spatial) (Dwi Cahyani et al., 2020). Differences between rural and urban areas and the differences between areas close to the center of economic growth and conservation areas also determine the electrification ratio.  3.1 Household Electricity Access The official data from the West Java Provincial Government in 2020 confirmed the spatial inequality of access to electrical energy. Figure 2 depicts the number of households in rural areas that have not yet enjoyed electricity covering 19 administrative authorities.  Figure 2. The number of Households without electrical power access in West Java, 2020  Source: https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/  Figure 2 indicates that the Southern region was the worst in terms of households’ electricity access compared to the Central region as the buffer zone of the Provincial capital and the North as the buffer zone of the national capital. Generally, houses in forest outskirts and plantation areas are without an electric power supply. In contrast to the other eight municipalities having a one hundred percent Electrification Ratio, Banjar does not have it, as it is located in the South and has Batulawang Plantation Area administered by the PTPN VIII.     The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022   226                                                                               Laksana et al  The electricity supply in Indonesia mainly provides by PLN. In 2017, 93% of household electricity was from PLN (on-grid), and only 2.3% was off-grid. For housing costumer, electricity supply from PLN is classified into several power groups, ranging from 450VA to above 6600VA. Low-income customers enjoy Government subsidies by consuming 450VA or 900VA power (Dwi Cahyani et al., 2020). However, the National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction (TNP2K) reported that 40% of low-income households receive only 26% of the electricity subsidies. At the same time, 30% of high-income enjoy 40% of that (TNP2K, 2016). Following up on the report, in 2017, the Government revoked subsidies from non-poor households and determined 23.2 million households with 450 VA and 4.1 million households with 900VA as subsidy recipients. In 2020, 1.4 percent of households in rural areas of West Java (approximately 152,437 Households) utilized electricity power from non-PLN suppliers. Assuming that in West Java 100 percent of municipal electricity is from PLN, Figure 3 shows the proportion of rural households using PLN and Non-PLN electricity sources in 19 administrative areas.      Figure 3. The number of Households based on the electricity suppliers in West Java, 2020 Source: https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/   Another subject of energy consumption patterns is alternative energy use. Official data shows that apart from conventional energy commonly used, households in rural areas also utilize alternative energy sources. Table 1 details the number of families in 19 administrations in West Java that utilize various alternative energies, namely liquid biofuels, wind power, biomass energy, and solar energy.

The session on the condition of the existing telecommunications infrastructure in West Java is in the following subsection.  3.2  The Existing Condition of Telecommunication Infrastructure Telecommunications infrastructure development in West Java indicates positive trends in recent years. Figure 4 shows that in one year (2020-2021), the number of villages with strong cellular signal conditions increased by 80, while those with weak cellular signals decreased by 75. However, in 2021 there were still 23 villages without cellular phone signals, which were distributed larger in the South: Garut (7 villages), Cianjur, and Sukabumi (3 villages each).   Figure 4.

The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022                                                                                                                                     Laksana et al 229                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Figure 5. The Number of Villages with and without a BTS Tower in West Java, 2021 Source: https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/  Nevertheless, a BTS operates without recognizing the administrative area of the village. A BTS services depend on its spatial position on the earth's surface. (Virgana, 2016) conducted a spatial analysis using triangulation techniques to map telecommunication services from BTS towers in West Java in  Figure 6.   Figure 6. The Triangulation Analysis of BTS Towers Services in West Java, 2018  Source: Virgana, 2018   The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022   230                                                                               Laksana et al  The triangulation analysis in Figure 6 illustrates that if the nets on the map are sparse or not as dense, the signal coverage transmitted by BTS tends to be weak. Such areas are the potential to be blank spots. The map shows the tendency that the cities and the Northern areas to have better signal coverage than the Southern. BTS towers also transmit internet signals. Figure 7 illustrates the quality of internet services that reach villages in West Java. In 2018, half of the villagers enjoyed 4G networks, and the others accessed 3G and 2G networks. There was still one percent (66 villages) without internet signals or blank spots distributed in 18 Regencies majority in Tasikmalaya District (14 Villages).   Figure 7.

Figure 8 describes the proportion of the availability of internet facilities in village offices in 19 administrations.  Figure 8.

The Index consists of three sub-indices: 1) Access and Infrastructure, 2) the Use of ICT, and 3) Expertise.  Based on Indonesian Central Statistics Bureau (BPS) data, the West Java ICT Development Index increased from 5.38 in 2017 to 6.00 in 2020, indicating a moderate grade stagnantly (Figure 8). Relating to this research, Figure 8 also depicts the sub Index of ICT Access and Infrastructure of West Java still in the moderate index, despite its progress from 6.02 to 6.65 in the period.    Figure 9. The West Java ICT Development Index, 2017-2020 Source: https://bps.go.id/   In 2020, there were only two provinces with high indexes In terms of Sub-index Access and Infrastructure of ICT, namely DKI Jakarta and DI Yogyakarta. While others, still had a moderate and low index, one of which was West Java. The Top Ten Access and Infrastructure of the ICT Development sub-index are: 1) DKI Jakarta, 2) DI Yogyakarta, 3) Bali, 4) Riau Islands, 5) East Kalimantan, 6) West Java, 7) Banten, 8) Central Java, 9) East Java, 10) North Kalimantan.     To improve ICT Development Index and electrical facilities in West Java, the Government needs to seek adequate investment. The next session discusses the investment profile in West Java, starting with foreign and ending with domestic investment.   3.3  Foreign Investment Profile The foreign investment data in 2016-2021 based on administrative area is in Table 3, with highlights in the highest investment location and the Provincial capital as a comparison.  The Table also reveals that in those years, more than half of foreign investment was in Bekasi and Karawang.  Meanwhile, other Regencies and Municipalities in the South, like Banjar, Tasikmalaya, and Ciamis, had almost zero foreign investment. The aggregate data in Table 3, represented by Figure 10, shows the foreign Investment info-graphic in West Java. The Graphic reveals that from 2016 to 2020, Bekasi was the foreign investors' favorite, followed by Karawang as the second. Meanwhile, in other regions, even in Bandung as the Provincial capital, the proportion of foreign investment is below ten percent. Figure 10 illustrates that the total foreign investment fluctuated from IDR 74.99 trillion in 2016 to IDR 88.22 trillion in 2019. In 2020 it decreased to IDR 69.03 trillion, supposedly due to the pandemic, although higher than those in 2017, signaling that the pandemic has an insignificant effect on foreign investment in West Java.

Next, in 2017, they shifted to housing, industrial estates, and offices. Furthermore, in 2019-2020, when the covid-19 pandemic hit the world economy, they invested in transportation, warehouse, and communication.  Figure 11 reveals the most attractive business sector for foreign investors showing their trend in 2016-2020. The Electricity, Gas, and Water sector was also included in the graph to support the research topic discussion. The next session discusses the Domestic Investment Profile.  3.4 Domestic Investment Profile Table 5 details domestic investment in West Java based on spatial distribution during 2016-2020. From a spatial point of view, the domestic investment profile in West Java indicates a similar trend to foreign investment where it were majority in Bekasi and Karawang. However, from a total investment-trend point of view, domestic and foreign investments were different. As illustrated in Figure 12 comparing Figure 10, the trend of total foreign investment fluctuated while the domestic dramatically increased even during the pandemic period.

The Info-graphic of Domestic Direct Investment in West Java  Based on Business-Sector Distribution, 2016―2020  Source: https://opendata.jabarprov.go.id/  Based on the Figure 13 configuration, the highest proportion of domestic investment in 2016 was for the Construction sector or 20.57%. Even though it turned to the Food Industry sector (17,60%) in 2017, It return to construction sector in the following years with a significant increase in the proportion from 24,10% to 33.79 % in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2020 almost half of domestic investment was in the Construction sector, indicating the domestic investment climate in West Java insensitive to the pandemic situation.   The elaboration of electricity, telecommunication infrastructure, and regional investment in the previous section, then the subjects for confirmation to interviewees privately. The results of the interviews were a resume of points, and the long list of opportunities and challenges of each sector development. The all together, then discussed on the FGD to formulate policy recommendations which analyzed in the following section. The analysis is started with the issues on investment, followed by issues on electricity, and ends with issues on telecommunication.  3.5 The Opportunities and Challenges Analyses of the Regional Investment The interviews discussed the function of the West Java Provincial Government in the investment sector on conceptual and managerial aspects. The local Government policies in the investment sector conceptually are contained in the General Investment Plan (RUPM) document. The RUPM of West Java Province ratified in Governor Regulation 13 of 2013 concerning the General Plan of Investment of West Java Province (Peraturan Gubernur Jawa Barat Nomor 13, 2013). Managerially, the local executive institution (OPD) of RUPM is the Regional Investment Coordinating Board (BKPMD). In addition, following the development of laws and regulations regarding Regional Government, in 2016, a restructuring took place. The OPD handling investment is the One Stop Integrated Licensing and Investment Office (DPMPTSP). Based on the Governor’s Regulation (Pergub) Number 26 of 2016 concerning Main Duties, Functions, Details of Unit Tasks, and Work Procedures of the DPMPTSP, the OPD function is more likely to be an investor service executive than a coordinating function (Peraturan Gubernur Jawa Barat Nomor 26, 2016). Thus, the Local Governments focus on providing excellent service to investors, especially in terms of ease of investment, business licensing services, and other permits.  In 2021, the investment coordination function is then carried out by the BUMD, Investment, and Development Administration Bureau under the Provincial Secretariat based on Governor Regulation  The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022                                                                                                                                     Laksana et al 237                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Number 4 of 2021 concerning Main Duties, Functions, Details of Duties, and Work Procedures for the Regional Secretariat of West Java Province (Peraturan Gubernur Jawa Barat Nomor 4, 2021). Interviews and FGDs reveal that the vision of West Java Development, namely “Jabar Juara Lahir Batin dengan Sinergi dan Kolaborasi,” is very relevant to developing investment in West Java. With such development vision, West Java Province enjoys synergy with central Government programs (through Ministry/Agency programs), with neighboring Provincial Governments, and with local Governments in foreign countries through Sister Province programs. In addition, the development of West Java does not only rely on the Government budget, but also collaborates with investment from the private sector. Among the forms of development synergy (between Government agencies) is the issuance of Presidential Regulation 87 of 2021 concerning the Acceleration of Development of the Rebana and Southern of West Java Regions (Peraturan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 87, 2021). With the priority program activities of Ministries/Institutions (K/L) and optimization of the Specific Purpose Allocation Fund (DAK), both physical and non-physical, Regional Incentive Funds (DID) and Co-administration Tasks (TP) from Ministries/Agencies can be a solution to budget constraints of local Governments in developing. In addition, development synergies are also through cooperation between local Governments. Not only with bordering provinces, such as DKI Jakarta, Banten, and Central Java, but also with provinces that are geographically far apart, such as the Province of West Sumatra for the 50-hectare corn planting program. Furthermore, in the West Java Tourism, Trade and Investment Partnership (WJ-TRIP), the Governor of West Java, M. Ridwan Kamil, opened up opportunities for cooperation with 33 provinces in Indonesia. He said: "The economy does not need to be limited to political areas. There is supply and demand, there is prosperity. So the important thing is optimizing interregional trade and cooperation” (Nugraha, 2021). The development of West Java is not only in synergy with local governments in Indonesia, but also with several local Governments in foreign countries. Among them are 1) South Australia; 2) South Chungcheong Province, South Korea; 3) prefecture Shizuoka, Japan; and 4) four provinces in the People's Republic of China (PRC), namely Guangxi Zhuang, Chongqing, Sichuan, and Heilongjiang. Furthermore, the West Java Provincial Government conducted development Collaboration with the private sector through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) mechanism. The public can monitor the progress by accessing the website http://kpbu.jabarprov.go.id/ page containing comprehensive information about PPPs in West Java, including eight forthcoming strategic projects.  One of the eight strategic projects relevant to this research is the construction of a Solar Power Plant (PLTS) to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. By installing solar panels in Regional Government buildings, schools, sports buildings, and health facilities, the Provincial Government will cooperate with private companies which resell the power to PLN. When this paper written, the project was still in the preliminary study stage. Based on interviews and FGD, the summary of investment development opportunities in West Java are: 1. The West Java Development Vision, which relies on synergy and Collaboration, can be a solution to limited local budgets in development investment. 2. The existence of the Presidential Regulation 87/2021 on the Acceleration of Development of the Rebana and Southern West Java Areas can trigger the emergence of a new center of economic growth in West Java Province. 3. Foreign investors are interested in the telecommunication sector, especially during the pandemic. In addition, to identifying opportunities, the interviews and FGDs also identified challenges faced by the West Java Provincial Government in investment. Summary the challenges facing the investment sector in West Java include: 1. The interregional investment inequality may increase the economic and development gap across regions in West Java. 2. Sectorial Investment Gap: Foreign Investors were interested in Transportation Sector, while Domestic Investors were interested in Construction Sector.

The analysis of opportunities and challenges for developing the electrical energy sub-sector reviewed in the next sub-section.  3.6 The Opportunities and Challenges Analyses of Electricity Development Based on the explanation of the interviewees, the national electricity policy is juridical based on Law Number 30 of 2009 concerning Electricity (Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 30, 2009). In West Java, the implementation of the regulations translated into Regional Regulation Number 4 of 2019 concerning Amendments to Regional Regulation Number 21 of 2001 concerning the Implementation of Electricity (Peraturan Daerah Nomor 4, 2019). The technical planning, namely the Regional General Electricity Plan (RUKD), comprehensively ruled in the West Java Provincial Regulation Number 2 of 2019 concerning the General Regional Energy Plan / RUED (Peraturan Daerah Provinsi Jawa Barat Nomor 2, 2019). Based on regulatory references provided by informants, the RUED contains long-term modeling of energy needs based on the energy mix, including Electricity, Gas, Fuel Oil (BBM), and Bioenergy. Energy demand modeling includes five sector categories, namely: 1) Transportation Sector, 2) Industrial Sector, 3) Household Sector, 4) Commercial Sector, and 5) Other Sectors. Energy Demand Modeling in the household sector in West Java in units of Million Ton Oil Equivalent (MTOE) detailed in Table 8.

From year to year, it projected that starting in 2017, the main household energy will switch from gas to electricity. In the future, by 2025, 66.4% of household energy needs will be electrical energy; furthermore, in 2050, electrical energy needs will reach 85.2% of the various total types of energy consumed.  The discussion then continued to the scope of the Provincial Government authority in the electrical energy sub-sector based on regulations. The article 6 of the West Java Provincial Regulation 4/2019 concerning Electricity Management details 11 (eleven) authorities of the West Java Provincial Government. The eleven points of authority position the Provincial Government as the electricity regulator in its administrative area. The operation of providing electricity for the public interest, as mentioned in Article 16, carried out by the electricity provider. Operators of electricity providers carry out business activities based on the Electricity Supply Business Plan (RUPTL). Until this paper was written, the Governor's Regulation on RUPTL has not been published. Thus, the RUPTL in West Java refers to Government Regulation (PP) Number 23 of 2014 concerning Amendments to Government Regulation number 14 of 2012 concerning Business Plans for the Provision of Electricity (Peraturan Pemerintah Republik Indonesia Nomor 23, 2014). In the explanation of PP number 23/2014, it is written: "...the development of electricity infrastructure is capital-intensive and technology-intensive, while the availability of the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget (BUMN) for the development of electricity infrastructure has not been able to meet the total increase in electricity demand, so it is necessary to provide wider opportunities for private sectors to participate in the provision of electricity. In order to accelerate the fulfillment of electricity needs more efficiently, it is necessary to provide opportunities for private sectors and developers who are already operating to expand the supply of electricity to the local electric power system through direct appointment or direct selection mechanisms.” Because it is capital-intensive and technology-intensive, the business of providing electricity is massive and beyond administrative boundaries to meet economies of scale and be feasible in business calculations. For example, the scope of work of one of the power and grid units (PIKITRING) belonging to the State Electricity Company (PLN) covers Java, Bali, and Nusa Tenggara (JBN). This condition may be one of the reasons why the RUPTL has been sufficiently regulated by the PP so that the Governor's Regulation on RUPTL has not yet urgently issued. Nevertheless, West Java has a Regional State Owned Enterprise (BUMD), which engaged in the electricity sector, namely PT. Tirta Gemah Ripah. This BUMD operates a Micro Hydro Power Plant (PLTM) in Cirompang, Garut Regency. The business prospect of this BUMD considered bright due to the potential  The Journal of Indonesia Sustainable Development Planning (p. 222―245) Vol. 3 No. 3 – December 2022   240                                                                               Laksana et al  of river water resources with high water discharge and steep topography, as well as the electrification ratio, which not yet one hundred percent in the South West Java region. Although the BUMD business in the electricity sector has promising prospects in the future, the regional budget (APBD) for BUMD capital participation as an effort to expand business in the electricity sector still needs political support from the DPRD. Meanwhile, the strategy to anticipate the threat of a national and global economic recession, as recommended by the Regional Economic Recovery Committee (KPED) of West Java, prioritizes the food sector and its supply chain (Humas Jabar, 2022). The resume of the interview with the informants, accompanied by the literature submitted, is as follows. The West Java opportunities in the electricity sector include: 1. The pattern of needs, along with strategic steps to fulfill the need for electrical energy (comprehensively with other types of energy) in the long term (until 2050), has been taken into account by the Government and stipulated in the West Java Provincial regulation Number 2 of 2019 concerning the General Plan of Regional Energy. 2. The Regional Regulation 4 of 2019 concerning the Implementation of Electricity took place. 3. West Java has the PT. Tirta Gemah Ripah, a BUMD which operates a Micro Hydro Power Plant (PLTM) located in Cirompang, Garut Regency. The electrification ratio in South West Java and the presence of rivers with high water discharge and steep topography are opportunities for BUMD's business expansion in providing electricity in remote areas. The challenges for West Java electricity development are: 1. Future energy needs (2050 projections) in the household sector mostly (85.2% of total energy demand) are electrical energy with a volume of 16.2 Million Ton Oil Equivalent (MTOE) 2. Electricity supply business is Capital-Intensive and technology-intensive, so the feasibility of the business requires a large production scale and a wide range of services (beyond administrative limits). Thus, the role of local Governments in the field of electrical energy is still limited. 3. BUMD's business expansion in the electricity sector requires political will. At the same time, the Regional Economic Recovery Strategy recommended by KPED focus on the food sector and its supply chain. The identified opportunities and challenges discussed in the FGD were then processed to formulate policy recommendations as described in Table 9.

Technically, the implementation carried out by the Telecommunications and Information Office regarding to the Governor's Regulation 60 of 2017 concerning Duties, Functions, Details of Unit Tasks, and Work Procedures for the Office of Communication and Information (Peraturan Gubernur Jawa Barat Nomor 60, 2017). Based on the discussion, it identified the relevant mandates of Perda Number 4/2021 with this research are: 1) the implementation of Electronic-Based Government System Services (SPBE) and 2) the development of a digital province. In line with this research, on 27-28 July 2022, the West Java Provincial Government, in Collaboration with ITB and BAKTI Kominfo held a Hybrid-Webinar with two discussion agendas: 1) Discussion on digital transformation in the economic, social and environmental fields after the Covid-19 pandemic, and 2) Discussion on the impact and potential of digital development Collaboration for economic, social, and environmental recovery. The event enriched the information, sharpened issues, and expanded the perspective of the research discussions, as well as confirmed that the research theme is relevant to strategic issues in West Java. The Covid-19 pandemic considered as the trigger for the acceleration of digitalization in almost all sectors. The digital transformation occurs in business, education, and bureaucracy. The Government (both national and regional) believe that public service digitalization support the national economy, financial governance, and inclusive finance. Furthermore, digitalization may increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public services, supporting transparency in the Government system, as well as optimizing regional revenues and fiscal health. The strategy by promote digital Government transactions for regional expenditure and income transactions, and digital-based or cashless payments to the public.  Public service digitalization was then supported by Presidential Decree no. 3 of 2021 concerning the Task Force for the Acceleration and Expansion of Regional Digitization (Keputusan Presiden Republik Indonesia Nomor 3, 2021). The Task Force aims to 1) encourage the implementation of Regional Government Digital Transactions (ETPD) in order to increase the transparency of regional financial transactions, support governance, and integrate regional financial management systems to optimize regional revenues;
