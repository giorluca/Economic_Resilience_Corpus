Theexistence of a community-based enterprise with a traditional business modelis often seen as a weakness, while social capital is a strength to thrive.However, a well-managed conventional business model can become one of thefoundations of a sustainable livelihood. This community service program wasscarried out with the Artha Mandiri Group, which is domiciled in KemadangVillage, Gunungkidul, Special Region of Yogyakarta. This program aimedto increase the economic resilience of group members by empowering andgrowing business capabilities with their social capital as their fundamentalstrength. The empowerment method used in this program was ParticipatoryAction Learning and Action Research (PALAR), which is considered an effectivetool for strategically transforming paradigms. This method focused on abalance between progressive, collaborative practice accompanied by an actionresearch foundation. The 6-month program has resulted in collaborativebusiness competency learning practice for group members, emphasizingdifferent processing methods to produce business line diversification. Thisgroupmade flour from land-owned rice paddy harvests with the same quality ascommercially produced. This achievement can also have an impact on businesscost efficiency.1. INTRODUCTIONIn the midst of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemicfrom early 2020 to 2021 in Indonesia, the agricultural sectorhas succeeded in becoming a pillar of economic resilienceby growing 2.19% at a time when other sectors, such astourism and transportation, are suffering hard (Badan PusatStatistik, 2020). According to The World Bank: Data,agricultural sectors play an important role in the nationaleconomy through its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) byincreasing from 12.7% in 2019 to 13.7% in 2020 andbecoming a source of income for Indonesian as most ofthe land (29%) were assigned for agriculture (Pradana etal., 2019). Indonesia’s food crops are rice, corn, soybean,peanuts, and yam. Badan Pusat Statistik (2022) reportedthat the total production of rice as a staple food in Indonesiawas 55,670,219 tons in 2022. Most of the crops weretraded informally in traditional markets Vorley (2015), anddisruptions in its distribution system, transaction costs,and purchasing power led to food insecurity. Therefore,sustainable agricultural development is necessary tosupport food needs and provide the industrial sector andemployment opportunities Darsono (2008), that have beenaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic (Fry-Bowers, 2020).The pandemic has increased the risk to the food supplychain by creating pressure on the food system throughfood supply and demand, which has impacted Indonesia’sfood security (Ikhsan et al., 2021; Workie et al., 2020).According to a policy brief by Food and AgricultureOrganization of the United Nations (2006), food securityISSN 2460-9447(print), ISSN 2541-5883(online)*Corresponding author: Rossalina ChristantiDepartment of Accounting, Faculty of Business, Universitas Kristen Duta Wacana, Jl.

Advocating Community Economic Resilience Frameworkcan be reached when people can access adequate safe,nutritious food for their daily needs without the risk oflosing access to food because of sudden shocks. Indonesia’sfood security is associated with rice. Its production stabilityis important, and interruption in supply chain, distribution,and transaction because of health protocol standards due tothe pandemic could limit food affordability for Indonesianas well as farmers in rural areas (Akter, 2020; Ministryof Agriculture, 2020). As a result of social restrictions,planting time is delayed, especially for large-scale plantingssuch as rice, and low demand for horticultural commoditiesdue to decreased purchasing power and difficulty obtainingfertilizer in Indonesia (Oelviani et al., 2022).Based on our initial discussion with the chief ofKemadang Agricultural Cooperative in Gunungkidul, thedifficultiesencountered by the farmers there is the lack ofcompetence of farmer group members to make tacticaldecisions in managing their food barn to face marketcompetition,particularly the capability to produce productdiversification innovation, market positioning, pricingdecision strategies, and product costing strategies. Thesecapabilitie are necessary because, so far, they onlysell raw commodities to loan sharks or distributorsatlower prices, and there is no orientation to turn theminto value-added finished goods that are produced andmarketed professionally or following effective and efficientmanagement standards. As described above, this situationwas exacerbated by deteriorating economic conditions dueto the COVID-19 pandemic.Community Economic Resilience (CER) then becomesa framework that needs to be applied at the KemadangAgricultural Cooperative as research and action in dealingwith crises. Dinh & Pearson (2015) define CER as theeconomic capacity of a community to face economic shocksand adapt to sustain livelihoods. Dinh et al. (2017) furtherelaborated that community economic resilience can beachieved by managing community capital, such as socialcapital, human capital, natural capital, physical capital,and financial capital. The more abundant and diversethe endowment of resources owned or acquired by acommunity, the higher its ability to buffer against crisisshocks and adapt again.One of the efforts to increase resilience in KemadangAgricultural Cooperative is the constructionof a food barnas their physical, natural, and financial capital, which ismanaged by the cooperative.A food barn is intended to storethe harvest, so it can be distributed at the right time. Ifthere is no food barn, farmers are forced to sell their cropsas soon as the harvest period ends, which causes farmersto be unable to set competitive prices because supply farexceeds demand. However, food barn management stillneeds to be established professionally. In contrast, goodknowledge management can support business sustainabilityand create a circular economy that will continue to sharpenthe organization’s competitive advantage (Shih et al., 2018).The lack of sources of knowledge in business and finance islikely the root of the food barn management problem. It canpotentially cause problems for the sustainability of farmergroup businesses.To further improve the management of the food barn,the authors analyze that their social capital is a fundamentalstrength that can make the safety net remain resilient infacing pandemics or other crises. This capital also becomesthe foundation for further development and improvementof brand food barn management, especially in creatingnew product innovations from raw commodities in foodbarns. Introducing a simple business model design andfinancial management will be a starting point for identifyingthe competitive advantages and igniting new productinnovation. The previous literature also explains that socialcapital can improve food security – this is in line with thegeneral objective of implementing the service program forthe Artha Mandiri community (Nosratabadi et al., 2020).Thus, the author explores whether social capital can becomea paradigm foundation in increasing community economicresilience.Resilience is survival in the face of various shocks andcrises because it has the persistence, determination, andflexibility to adapt (Michel-Villarreal et al., 2019). Dinh etal. (2017) elaborated that community economic resiliencecan be achieved by managing community capital, suchas social capital, human capital, natural capital, physicalcapital, and financial capital. Economic recovery canoccur more quickly if community members have a senseof ownership, strengthen bonds between individuals, andnetwork with external parties to gain support and leverage(Manik et al., 2021). As a prolific researcher on socialcapital, Coleman (1988) explained that the structure ofsociety, manifested in patterns of communication andpatterns of living together in the community, can be an assetto increase productivity. Furthermore, it was identified thatthere are three components in adequate social capital – trust,the flow of information sharing, and social norms involvingsocial sanctions.Drawing on the concept of social capital in this serviceprocess, the authors believe that increasing the business andmanagement competence of the farmers that organize thatfood barn in Kemadang requires solid social capital as afoundation for the intended direction. The strong anchorsfor their livelihood growth are taking advantage of the trustbuilt in neighborly life, the flow and habits of sharingunique and specific information, and being motivated bypositive social norms.2. METHODReferring to the initial introductory statement, thiscommunity service program was carried out with theArtha Mandiri farmer group based in Kemadang Village,Tanjungsari Subdistrict, Gunungkidul District, YogyakartaSpecial Province. The authors selected this communityservice based on the university’s database and networking.The author sought a newly established community (underfive years old). This decision is related to the methodunderlying this community service program: ParticipatoryAction Learning and Action Research (PALAR), whichfocuses on collaborative vision crafting between theVol. 9, No. 2, www.jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jpkm∣∣∣∣ 118Christianti et al. Advocating Community Economic Resilience Frameworkcommunity and the author as facilitators. Furthermore, thiscommunity has a strong history of establishing harmoniousrelationships among its members with diverse socialbackgrounds. Their relationship was initiated throughsocial activity, and then the community leader formalizedthe organization and aimed to establish a cooperative.This farmer group, formed in 2021, has had the visionto increase the capacity of farmers and entrepreneurs inthe Kemadang Village area. The first program initiatedby this farmer group is initiating a food storage functionprojected as a new community business unit and expectedto be independent. The demographic profile of the membersof this farmer group varies. The majority of membershave more than one type of job or business. However, theprominent venture carried out by all members is cultivatingprivate agricultural land on a small scale. There are about15 members of the farmer group, and all of them wereinvolved in this community development program. Mostmembers own a small bar on Baron Beach, and some aretour guides, but on weekdays they farm their fields becausetourism is usually active on weekends.The Artha Mandiri farmer group is considered asuitable partner for this service because it already hasa relatively solid and stable organizational structure andmembership, even though its business model still needs tobe revised. The strength of the organizational structure willbe analyzed with the paradigm of social capital, whetherthe power of the community makes this organizationmore resilient, stable, and more likely to develop interms of individual economic independence and increasingorganizational capacity. This flow of the implementation ofthe designed program is illustrated in Figure 1.The method underlying the implementation of thiscommunity service program was the PALAR Processparadigm (Wood, 2019; Zuber-Skerritt, 2018). By usingthis method, community empowerment is a learning processthrough making an effort coupled with a research processto find a structured pattern and later used as a guidefor formulating formal policies that can be generalized.In addition, there is a participatory principle where thisprogram is a reciprocal action that must be sought fromboth parties, universities, partners, or the community. Thisprocess is illustrated in Figure 2.To start a community service program, an essentialpoint in initiating a collaboration process or approach withpartners is emphasizing synergizing the partner’s vision,facilitated by the service team. Vision and strategy mustemerge from the initiative of group members with therole of serving as a trigger for partner creativity. Theprogram initiation process is carried out with the principlesof equality and kinship. The Service Team will explore eachfarmer group’s aspirations, which will be the main topicsand achievements through community service programs.This service process is research and a learning processthat runs in parallel. Practical learning points emphasized inthis community development activity are general businessmanagement training and product diversification trainingpractices, as examples of a business that can be startedat the Artha Mandiri barn. The research point of thisactivity is to explore the process of community economicdevelopment according to the social capital paradigm,which is internalized in the community process of the ArthaMandiri community.Based on the envisioned goals, the authors – thefacilitators of this program – first conducted an initialmeeting with the community leaders to discuss thecommunity development program and activities timeline.The detailed activities are presented in Table 1.Table 1 .

RESULT & DISCUSSION3.1 Participative action learningMost farmer group members have culinary businesses,considering the geographical geography of the KemadangVillage area, located on the southern coast of the SpecialRegion of Yogyakarta. On a micro-business scale, eachmember of the farmer group utilizes the harvested rice asa raw material for their culinary business. Based on thisgood practice, flour-grinding machines are given to farmergroups as initial capital. This flour machine is ownedcommunally by farmer groups. The hope is that with aflour grinding machine, the rice harvest produced fromeach private/household field can be processed into flour. Inparticular, rice not whole or unfit for sale can be sold withscrap value and used as raw material for members’ culinarybusinesses. With a flour machine owned by a food barnor farmer group community, members can save the cost ofbuying flour or pay for flour milling services.Vol. 9, No. 2, www.jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jpkm∣∣∣∣ 120Christianti et al.

In terms of increasing barns’ economic capacity,the business materials were simplified and contextualizedaccording to the community’s needs. The followings arethe topics discussed and the targeted practices presented inTable 2.The structured business material or theories designedpresented in Table 2 have been given to members of thefarmer groups to complement the business knowledge theyhave learned. The competitive advantage of combiningthe agricultural and tourism sectors of the economy canbe a massive opportunity for this community. Practices toproduce quality flour from rice groats have also been carriedout. Then, flour processed from household agriculturalproduce is processed into processed chips. The followingtraining activities are presented in Figure 3.One of the most competitive products in the area isthe seaweed and anchovy chips. The recipe is unique tothe community. With the flour-grinding machine given tothe community, they could process their flour from theirharvested rice paddy. They have specific ingredients. Theyalso aim to maintain the freshness of the chips. Thecommunity mentioned : "We aim to produce chips with acertain level of quality. Our problem is we have to keepthe ingredients fresh. It only lasts overnight. Otherwise,the batter would turn bad. With this machine, we can getthe same flour quality as the mill in the market, but at a farcheaper cost."Apart from producing tangible products for communitycooperatives, this community development also trains themembers to justify their business production costs. Basedon the workshop, the community concluded that they puta lower selling price than the cost expenditure. They alsocalculated their profit margin and justified their reasonable121∣∣∣∣ www.jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jpkm Vol. 9, No. 2,Christianti et al. Advocating Community Economic Resilience FrameworkFigure 3 .

The communityworks together to identify its strengths and weaknesses,opportunities and threats, and innovation projections.3.2 Participative action researchAs an action research step, the authors interviewed thecommunity leader. He is also a priest. Researchers explorewhether the elements of the social capital Coleman (1988);Lochner et al., (1999); Mountford et al. (2020) owned bythis community can strengthen the solidity of farmer groupsand become capital for further economic development. Theessence of the constructed interview shown in Table 3.The author identifies themes constructed based on theclassical theory of social capital and the developmentof social capital theory to broaden the perspective andcontextualization of the areas of needs that are the maintopics in this service.The first dimension in the social capital construct isthe trust built between community members. Since theinitial meeting to discuss opportunities and strategies forthe community development program, it was found that thisservice was carried out in a church-owned building, and thiswas confirmed by the pastor, who also acts as a builder and acommunity mobilizer. Although, in general, the Indonesianhas the identity of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, dynamics are stilloften encountered in practice. There is an intrinsic meaningcaptured by the belief of all members that everyone respectseveryone else’s trust and provides an open and neutral spaceto develop without disturbing personal principles.The second dimension is an information-sharingstrategy, where word of mouth is very effective in non-urban areas (Khaddam, 2020; Pourfakhimi et al., 2020).In addition to utilizing church networking that has branchposts and church members/actors who often gather forworship, information is also shared through communitynetworks, most of which have businesses in the tourismsector and cultivate agricultural fields. Pastors who arecommunity leaders and community leaders have broadaccess and exposure to universities and institutions thathave the potential to collaborate.The third dimension is related to the internal valuesthat are lived in the community and social norms,which are an essential basis for the structure of socialcapital (Nosratabadi et al., 2020). Based on theresults of interviews, it was found that the processof community maturity in Kemadang Village is quitedynamic. This analysis is based on the history of internalconflicts experienced by community members relatedto misunderstandings about religious issues. However,the mediation process continues, and, in the end, thecommunity members can live side by side fairly, evenworking together to enhance personal and communalwelfare. In addition, the unique traditional ceremonies inKemadang Village are a means to deepen moral values.Finally, the author views the importance of the ability toinnovate Lawson & Samson (2018); Pathak & Mukherjee(2020) so that this community development program can beimpactful. The facilitator from the university is responsiblefor stimulating new ideas and creativity. This method isessential, considering community members can only findand cultivate a competitive advantage. The food barn is thefirst initiative of the Artha Mandiri community. Next, theexact line of business must be defined and operationalized.Training on identifying competitive advantages, compilingbusiness model canvases, finance, and technical sciencerelated to simple food technology is provided to ignitebusiness process innovation.Social capital must be perceived as a strategic toolin developing the business process to promote economicresilience. Elaborating trust, effective knowledge sharing,internalizing social norms, innovation, and tangibleproducts would significantly impact society. Communityleader mentioned: "With this knowledge and skills inprocessing agricultural products, Artha Mandiri Food Barncan sell processed products, both ready-to-consume andsemi-finished products. With the ability to sell finishedor semi-finished products, we shall get a higher profit.Because it can obtain higher profits from sales, ArthaMandiri Food Barn will have the ability to prosperfarmers by buying agricultural products at better prices andproviding higher SHU to members. With this flour machine,Artha Mandiri Food Barn can produce its flour so thatproduction costs become cheaper so that it can be sold ata lower (competitive) price or has the opportunity to makea better profit."Vol. 9, No. 2, www.jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jpkm∣∣∣∣ 122Christianti et al.

CONCLUSIONThis community service program is carried out with a morecomprehensive method. The author believes that serving incommunity development needs to be done practically. Thecontent of knowledge sharing should be strengthened witha philosophical foundation. Therefore, the author sharpensthe direction of this devotion to be more fundamental. Theresult of this six months program is as follows. Thiscommunity development program has been carried out incollaboration with community members to share knowledgeand practice on conducting business in the agriculture sector.It is hoped that those discussion processes can be developedfurther independently. On top of that, the author concludesthat producing tangible products must be accompanied byan awareness of the fundamental values lived in society. Inthis case, social capital is an essential element that shouldnot be lost from community service programs.Reflecting on the community service program at theArtha Mandiri farmer group in Kemadang, Gunungkidul,strong social capital has proven to be a catalyst forresilience and community economic development. Thepandemic has had a massive impact on tourism and hasmade people think about alternative businesses. The ArthaMandiri group can be empowered to alter their businessprocesses. Combining a personal business with a groupbusiness can be a successful strategy. Concretely, thefacilitating team provided a flour-grinding machine whichis expected to become the group’s business capital. Inaddition, the facilitating team transfers business knowledgeto equip tangible product innovations with intellectualcapital. As a result, the Artha Mandiri group can learnflour milling skills and mill their crops without going to themarket and paying extra costs. In addition, this group candevelop unique products in the Kemadang area to be sold ata lesser cost.This program still has weaknesses and sides that canbe improved. First, the authors are not able measurethe monetary impact of community sales. The scope ofthis program is initiating the collective business and tryingto upskill the members with hard and soft skills. Thebasic marketing strategy was not yet explored. Second,encouraging members to produce product diversificationinnovations ready to sell is not easy. Until now, productdiversification is still limited to making chip productscommonly sold in the market. Further innovations related123∣∣∣∣ www.jurnal.ugm.ac.id/jpkm Vol. 9, No. 2,Christianti et al. Advocating Community Economic Resilience Frameworkto the community’s superior products have yet to be found.The intensity to design more competitive products untilit is ready for sale requires extraordinary efforts fromcommunity members. The challenge comes from eachmember who already has private businesses. Allocatingtime and effort to create a new product invention seemsto be a struggle. Lastly, in the future, this communitydevelopment program should focus on developing ArthaMandiri community-level product development. By then,this community development program will be sustained.ACKNOWLEDGMENTWe would like to extend our gratitude to Rev. ChristianaRiyadi and all the members of Artha Mandiri that have beenworking with the authors in conducting this communitydevelopment program.
