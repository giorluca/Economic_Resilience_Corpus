Therefore, this paper asks: what strategies can return people towork without returning to the old high-emissions economy? How can we modify the oldeconomic system to reduce environmental impacts while rebuilding employment?Technological change, such as replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy (RE), is necessarybut, in an economy that’s growing, unlikely to be sufficiently rapid to avoid dangerous climatechange. Degrowth in physical consumption, especially by the ‘rich’ 10%, towards a steady-state economy, is needed as well as low-carbon jobs.Technical summaryIn planning recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments aim to return to eco-nomic growth that, by default, is closely coupled to growth in consumption of energy, mate-rials and land, together with growth in population in some countries. This scenario almostcertainly forecloses the option of a smooth transition to a climate in which global heatingis limited to 1.5°C above the pre-industrial level, the aspirational Paris target. Although thetransition to energy efficiency and 100% RE – based mainly on wind, solar and hydro – isnow technically feasible, affordable and progressing in some countries, states, cities andbusinesses, technological transformation would be chasing a retreating goal if economicgrowth returns. Even to stay below 2°C, reducing consumption, especially by the rich 10%,is needed as well as technology change. Therefore, we explore a pandemic recovery scenarioin which low-carbon employment creation is fostered during a process of general degrowth, inbiophysical terms, towards an ecologically sustainable steady-state economy. Strategies aresuggested for governments to create low-carbon jobs, together with reduced consumption,and to drive and finance the transition. With strong public pressure on governments andbusiness, a 2°C target without overshoot may still be possible.Social media summaryDegrowth can be combined with green employment to cut emissions while improving socialequity.1. IntroductionIn the first half of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, global CO2 emissions were8.8% lower than in the same period in 2019 (Liu et al., 2020). To limit global heating tothe aspirational Paris target of 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures (UNFCCC, 2015),global CO2 emissions would have to be reduced by about 55% by 2030 (UNEP, 2019). Thisforeshadows the magnitude of the climate mitigation challenge, which is underlined by theobservation that, despite the appearance of a second wave of COVID-19 in several parts ofthe world, there was, commencing in April–May 2020, an increase in global emissions assome economies started to recover from the pandemic (Liu et al., 2020).Yet, business activity must regrow, in order to provide the desperately needed jobs that werelost, and even selective ‘green’ growth will increase consumption. This raises the followingresearch questions, which are also questions of urgent practical politics: how can climatechange be mitigated while economies recover from the pandemic? More generally, how canpandemic recovery be designed to avoid repeating the adverse environmental and socialimpacts of the old economic system?Critiques of the existing economic system, and neoclassical economics theory that allegedlyjustifies it, abound (e.g. Blatt, 1983; Daly, 1977; Daly & Cobb, 1990; Dennis, 2016; Keen, 2011;Ormerod, 1994; Smith & Max-Neef, 2011; Waring, 1988). These authors argue that the eco-nomic system is environmentally destructive because it encourages endless growth in the con-sumption of energy, materials and land, together with population growth, on a finite planet,https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.32Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 121.209.33.191, on 30 Dec 2020 at 20:36:28, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available atand because it doesn’t distinguish sufficiently between environ-mentally beneficial consumption/production on one hand andenvironmental damaging consumption/production on the otherhand. The critique also points out that the old system fostersinequity based on exploitation and other forms of social injustice.Inequity fosters ill-health, reduced life expectancy, illiteracy,violence, crime and other social problems (Wilkinson & Pickett,2010). The critique of neoclassical macroeconomic theory isthat it contains unjustifiable assumptions and fundamentalinternal contradictions, and so has little relevance to real-worldeconomies.Therefore, during the pandemic and its recovery, there is theopportunity to debate, develop and implement new or modifiedsocioeconomic systems that can create and maintain ‘sustainableprosperity’ while being consistent with ecological sustainabilityand improved social equity/justice (D’Alessandro et al., 2020;Wiedmann et al., 2020). Within this context, the scenario ofthis paper addresses rapid climate mitigation for the former andfull employment, together with health benefits (Krug & Eberl,2018; WHO, 2018), for the latter.Energy generation from fossil fuels – providing electricity,non-electrical heat and transportation – was responsible for73% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 (Ge &Friedrich, 2020). Therefore, the vast majority of fossil fuelresources must be left in the ground (Steffen & Rice, 2015).Mitigation must be rapid because we may have only a few yearsat most to keep the global average heating below 1.5°C(DNV-GL, 2020; Lenton et al., 2019), taking account of feedbacks.Global energy-related CO2 emissions increased by 12.7% from2010 to 2018 (IEA, 2019). Realistically, achieving 1.5°C appearsimpossible, except as a result of economic collapse, but 2°Cmay still be achievable, because its carbon emissions budget isabout three times that of the 1.5°C target (IPCC, 2018,Table 2.2). Even 2°C requires an urgent break in current emissiontrends (Friedlingstein et al., 2014).Section 2 discusses the strengths and limitations of techno-logical change in transitioning rapidly to net zero emissions,focussing on the energy sector. It finds that technological changeis necessary, but unlikely to be sufficient for keeping heatingsignificantly below 2°C, and therefore that socioeconomicand behavioural changes may be necessary. Hence this paperconsiders a COVID-19-recovery scenario with two principalcomponents.One component, called low-carbon jobs, involves creating newemployment in labour-intensive work with relatively low-carbonemissions (Section 3.2). This involves both technological andsocioeconomic changes. In the energy sector, these jobs arecreated by substituting renewable energy (RE) for fossil fuelswhile increasing energy efficiency (EE) and energy conservation.However, even these selective activities will increase consumptionto some degree and hence emissions (Suh, 2006). Therefore, thesecond component of the scenario (Section 3) is degrowth to asteady-state economy (Daly, 1977; D’Alisa et al., 2014; Dietz &O’Neill, 2013). The pandemic has assisted to some degreein facilitating degrowth, because many people have becomeaccustomed to working from home and walking and cycling forrecreation near their homes. Degrowth requires socioeconomicand behavioural changes.Section 4 discusses a strategy for degrowth, including policiesfor reducing rebound and funding the transition using ModernMonetary Theory in countries where it is applicable. Section 5is the general discussion and conclusion.2. Technological change is necessary but not sufficient2.1 Renewable energy and energy efficiency can replace fossilfuelsA large body of evidence – comprising scenario studies, simula-tions and practical experience in several regions, countries andstates/provinces – indicates that zero-emission energy could beprovided by a combination of RE and EE and that the transitionwould be affordable (e.g. Bogdanov et al., 2019; Butler et al., 2020;Diesendorf & Elliston, 2018; Elliston et al., 2016; Graham et al.,2020; IRENA, 2020; Jacobson et al., 2015, 2018; Lazard, 2019;Ram et al., 2019). Furthermore, recent research indicates thatthe energy return on energy invested of renewable electricity tech-nologies and systems may be typically equal to or greater than thatof fossil-fuelled electricity (Brockway et al., 2019; Diesendorf &Wiedmann, 2020; Leccisi et al., 2016; Raugei & Leccisi, 2016).The main elements of the transition strategy proposed by theseand other RE and EE researchers are to:(1) improve EE of buildings, appliances and industrial processes;(2) replace fossil fuelled electricity generation with renewableelectricity and storage;(3) electrify non-electrical heating and most transportation;(4) use renewable electricity to split water to produce hydrogen,convert it to ammonia which is more manageable, and usethis ‘renewable’ fuel in aircraft and ships and for long-distance road transport in remote areas and(5) assist workers disadvantaged by the transition by retraining,relocation and retirement packages.Table 1 summarises the status and affordability of the pro-posed strategic initiatives for the RE + EE scenario.Most global electricity will be generated by wind and solar sup-plemented by hydro. Regions lacking these RE resources willimport renewable electricity, in most cases by transmission lineand in a minority of cases as gaseous or liquid ‘renewable’ fuelsby a tanker ship. Thus, a relatively rapid global transition, com-pleted before 2040, for transitioning to renewable electricity andelectrifying most transport, appears technically and economicallyfeasible. This covers the majority of emissions in most countries.But, transitioning fossil-fuelled heating, for homes, commercialbuildings and industry, to electricity may take longer because ofthe long lifetimes of existing fossil-fuelled heating technologies(REN21, 2019). Non-energy industrial emissions (e.g. makingcement and iron ore), ‘green’ hydrogen and agriculture stillneed more research and development.2.2 Chasing a receding targetFrom 2010 to 2017, global total final energy consumption (TFEC)grew by 10% (IEA, 2019). Given that the global population growthrate averaged over the same period was 8.5% (United Nations,2019), TFEC per person grew 1.57% over the same period.Global material flows have also increased (Wiedmann et al.,2015). Thus, apart from the pandemic pause in 2020, technologychange has been chasing a receding target. Since actions to slowpopulation growth (education of women, dissemination of contra-ceptive information and improved social security) are likely to beslow, the principal mitigation efforts must focus on both techno-logical change and reducing energy consumption per person.Similarly, although technological improvements can makesome reductions in emissions from non-energy industrial2 Mark Diesendorfhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.32Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 121.209.33.191, on 30 Dec 2020 at 20:36:28, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available atprocesses and agriculture, reductions in consumption – forexample, by increased reuse and recycling of materials and eatingless red meat – will also be necessary in these sectors.3. Socioeconomic and behavioural strategies to reduceconsumption3.1 Choice of strategyWiedmann et al. (2020, Table 1) have identified a wide range ofstrategies for ‘sustainable prosperity’, ranging from radicalapproaches such as Eco-socialism and Eco-anarchism, throughreformist approaches such as Post-Growth and Steady-StateEconomies, to Green Growth, such as ecological modernisationcharacterised partly by economic growth decoupled to somedegree from environmental impacts. The scenario of the currentpaper combines low-carbon jobs, which inevitably drive somegrowth in economic activity, with a reformist strategy comprisingdegrowth to a steady-state economy (Daly, 1977; D’Alisa et al.,2014; Dietz & O’Neill, 2013). Low-carbon jobs are necessary,but not sufficient, for cutting emissions (Agora Energiewende,2020; Parrique et al., 2019).This strategy is chosen for the following reasons:(1) to restore employment to people who lost it during theCOVID-19 pandemic and, if possible, provide employmentfor all who wish to work; many of the jobs lost are in the ser-vice sectors (especially in retail, small businesses and tourism)which are labour-intensive and, apart from air and roadtransport, relatively low in carbon emissions;(2) to achieve rapid, deep climate mitigation;(3) because some parts of the economy (e.g. RE and EE technolo-gies; public and active transport; environmental protection)must grow, while other parts (e.g. fossil fuel use and nativeforest logging) must decline and(4) because, beyond a low threshold, economic growth leads toonly slight improvements in well-being (Fanning & O’Neill,2019).Although the focus of this paper is on government strategiesand policies on the macroeconomic scale, it does not discountthe possibility that individual and grassroots community initia-tives will greatly expand independently from governments. Theycan reduce emissions and other environmental impacts, but arelimited by existing institutions. For example, communities thatwish to grow their own food and create their own microgridsare constrained by land access and regulations favouring electri-city utilities, respectively. Therefore, government action, drivenby changes in individual and community attitudes and behaviour,is necessary to remove barriers.The current paper uses Herman Daly’s (1977, p. 17) biophys-ical definition of a steady-state economy: ‘an economy with con-stant stocks of people and artifacts [sic], maintained at somedesired, sufficient levels by low rates of maintenance “throughput”’.Using a biophysical definition is important, because a monetarydefinition in terms of GDP obscures the fact that growth insome businesses and industries results in much lower emissionsthan growth in other businesses and industries. It is well estab-lished that on average GDP and biophysical impact are coupled,although there are exceptions observed over short periods oftime in specific locations for particular environmental impacts(Haberl et al., 2020; Le Quéré et al., 2019; Parrique et al., 2019).However, in recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic, we areless concerned with the average, than the economic activitiesthat can be grown at the margin.

IP address: 121.209.33.191, on 30 Dec 2020 at 20:36:28, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available atcontext, we are not concerned about the fate of GDP – if an indexis really needed, other indices, such as the Index of SustainableEconomic Welfare (Lawn, 2006), would be more appropriate.3.2 Low-carbon jobsTable 2 compiles suggestions from numerous scholarly, NGO andmedia publications, for low-carbon employment, that also addressmajor environmental, social and health (WHO, 2018) issues, forwhich there is generally believed to be medium and high jobcreation potential. It includes the restoration of low-carbon, high-labour intensity jobs lost during the pandemic. Climate change isa causative factor in many of the issues with high environmentalimpacts. The high additional employment potential of RE and EEis well documented (Briggs et al., 2020; Hondo & Moriizumi,2017; IRENA, 2019); employment is also likely to be high forchild care, nursing, education and training, and firefighting.Expanding nursing and childcare has both general social andhealth benefits and specific value as a precautionary approachfor managing pandemics, present and future. Firefighting is partof the defence against one of the devastating impacts of climatechange (Mullins et al., 2020).The largest initial increases in emissions from employment listedin Table 2 are likely to come from responses involving improvementof physical infrastructure. However some of these investments canlead to net reductions in emissions over their lifetimes: for example,railways that substitute for road and air travel; transmission linesthat enable a higher penetration of RE into the grid; energy efficientpublic/social housing located close to public transport and towncentres; pollution control measures that improve public healthand hence reduce the demand for medical and hospital facilities.Technological improvements, such as low-emission cement andzero-emission processes for replacing metallurgical coal for makingiron, would greatly reduce the emissions from constructing infra-structure. However, selective growth, even in the service sector, isunlikely to reverse the absolute growth in the total biophysicaleconomy (Parrique et al., 2019; Suh, 2006; Victor, 2012). Furtherreduction of throughput of materials, energy and land-use, togetherwith a levelling off of population growth, is also required.Althoughmany environmental NGOs are currently recommend-ing Green Growth recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, very fewgovernments are planning for it. Indeed, the government ofAustralia, the world’s largest exporter of natural gas and one of thetwo largest coal exporters, has announced a ‘gas-led recovery’(Morton, 2020) and budgeted a subsidy to an old existing coal-firedpower station (Joshi, 2020). The main barriers to transitioning tolow-carbon businesses and industries are vested interests, especiallyfossil fuel interests (Pearse, 2007). Possibly the best of the inadequateresponses is that of the European Commission (2020), which pro-posed in May 2020 a dedicated recovery budget for 2021–2024 of750 billion EUR for stimulating the economy and accelerating cli-mate action as part of its European Green Deal and climate objec-tives. But Agora Energiewende (2020) has questioned whethermuch of this amount will actually be used for green investment.4. Strategy for degrowth to a steady-state economyMedia and anecdotal experience indicate that the pandemic,which has resulted in many people staying at home, has led toincreased work in home and garden improvements, includingEE, rooftop solar and local food production in developed coun-tries that are not subject to total lockdown. Hardware stores,plant nurseries and online stores are booming. This could be fos-tering some cultural change that can be built on for low-carbonsocio-economic recovery. A negative aspect, in terms of emissionsreduction, has been the reduction in use of public transport.Next, a common objection to the effectiveness of saving energymust be addressed.4.1 Reducing rebound from saving energyEnergy consumption per person can be reduced by EE and energyconservation (Creutzig et al., 2018). Energy efficiency is defined asobtaining the same energy service – for example, warm house inwinter; hot shower; cold food; mobility – with a reduced energyuse. It is achieved mostly by improved technologies, for example,home insulation; water-efficient shower head; energy-efficientrefrigerator; efficient vehicle or public transport. Energy conserva-tion (sometimes called energy sufficiency) is defined as reducingenergy use by accepting a modified or different energy service –for example, wearing warmer clothes and accepting reducedhome heating in winter; taking a shorter shower; walking orcycling to the local shops instead of driving. Since energy conser-vation is mostly behavioural, it cannot be legislated directly; it canbe facilitated by fostering a culture in which the benefits of suffi-ciency are contrasted with the downsides of waste. Governmentscan also provide appropriate infrastructure (e.g. pedestrianareas, cycleways and public transport) to give people alternativesto high-energy activities such as driving cars. Both EE and energyconservation can be implemented quickly and save money as wellas energy and emissions.Saving money by saving energy will lead to some rebound ineconomic activity, because part of the money saved is inevitablyspent or invested in increasing energy use or in consumption inother economic sectors (Binswanger, 2001; Herring & Sorrell,2009; Sorrell et al., 2020). For example, insulating one’s homecan result in heating the whole house in winter instead of justthe room occupied at a given time. Since wind and solar electricityis now cheaper than from fossil fuels over most of the world(Graham et al., 2020; IRENA, 2020; Lazard, 2019), the implemen-tation of these RE technologies can also lead to some rebound.Much of the literature on the rebound effect is written withinthe framework of neoliberal economics, implying that the demandfor energy services will never be satisfied (e.g. most chapters inHerring and Sorrell (2009)), that attempting to gain significantreductions in energy consumption is futile and that any reboundfrom EE should be accepted or even encouraged. This is madeexplicit by the recent trend to replace the term ‘energy efficiency’by ‘energy productivity’, defined at the macroeconomic level asGDP divided by energy consumption. Thus, although growingenergy productivity, absolute energy consumption can increase,as long as GDP grows more rapidly.Considering the importance of rebound for degrowth economicscenarios, very little research has been conducted on the effective-ness of various policies for reducing it (Font Vivanco et al., 2016).Since economic savings in the energy sector can lead to moreexpenditure in other sectors (indirect rebound effect), policiesmust extend beyond the energy sector. To follow a scenario ofdegrowth, reducing consumption is necessary, especially in devel-oped and rapidly developing countries (see below). Policy optionsinclude (Font Vivanco et al., 2016; Nørgaard, 2008):(1) mandatory labelling, regulations and standards for EE ofbuildings, appliances, equipment and industrial processes;4 Mark Diesendorfhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.32Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Their environmental impactscome indirectly from their savings and investments (Druckmanet al., 2011) as well as their direct expenditure on consumption.Their consumption can be reduced by progressive taxation thatdiscourages very high incomes and by carbon pricing.The COVID-19 pandemic shows that shutting down economicactivity and doing nothing else results in widespread unemploy-ment and impoverishment. However, modelling of the biophys-ical economy of Australia (Turner, 2016, 2019) shows thatemployment can be maintained while GDP and biophysicalTable 2.

These measures include reducing householdconsumption, reducing the length of the working week andstabilising the population. Macroeconomic modelling of theCanadian economy obtains similar results for its scenario ofdegrowth to a steady-state economy (Victor, 2012, 2019;Victor & Rosenbluth, 2007), which Victor defines in terms ofGDP and GDP per capita. Based on macrosimulation modelling,D’Alessandro et al. (2020) argue that degrowth – together with ajob guarantee, working time reduction and a wealth tax – isan economically and politically feasible scenario for cuttingemissions and improving social equity. However, the barriersto degrowth are vested interests, neoliberal economics and thepro-growth institutions and culture they have created that lockpeople in developed countries into high consumption energy-intensive lifestyles (Alexander, 2012).To the author’s knowledge, the only environmental NGOssupporting a steady-state economy or degrowth are those specif-ically dedicated to those purposes. Although degrowth has beenignored or dismissed as preposterous by almost all governmentsand trade unions, government interventions in the economyin response to the pandemic have set aside neoliberal dogmasagainst subsidising businesses, increasing (temporarily)unemployment and social security benefits, and avoiding hugedeficits. For example, the Australian government has allocated atotal of AUD 206 billion to COVID management and recoveryin 2019–20 and 2020–21, compared with its revenue in 2019–20 of AUD 470 billion and estimated revenue in 2020–21 ofAUD 464 billion (Australian Government, 2020). Governmentshave been forced to recognise implicitly that market economicshas failed to manage the economic impacts of the pandemic.This opens up the opportunity for public questioning of thevalidity of neoliberal economics, including the notion that eternalgrowth on a finite planet is possible and desirable.The remaining question is how governments can fund thetransition to a steady-state economy with low throughput.4.3 Funding the transition4.3.1 Funding in conventional macroeconomicsWithin the framework of conventional macroeconomics, a gov-ernment can use the following policies: increasing taxation, redu-cing other expenditures such as social security and education, andborrowing, for example, by issuing government bonds. The first isoften unpopular with the electorate, the second tends to increasepoverty and the third gives concerns about government debt, highexpenditure on interest and a burden on future generations. Somespecific policies for increasing government revenue and reducingwasteful expenditures, that are unlikely to damage social equity,are (Grudnoff & Richardson, 2018):(1) ensuring that multinational corporations selling goods andservices in the country of interest are taxed adequately;(2) removing any arbitrary legislative caps on the tax to GDPratio;(3) cancelling any proposed tax cuts;(4) removing government incentives for citizens to speculate inproperty;(5) reducing superannuation tax concessions;(6) placing super-profit taxes on the mining industry and(7) introducing a financial transactions tax.Additional economic savings can be obtained from the reduc-tion in air and water pollution and their health impacts, as well asthe reduction in water use and land degradation associated withmany coal-fired power stations.4.3.2 Funding in Modern Monetary TheoryIn recovering from the Global Financial Crisis and during the pre-sent COVID-19 crisis, the US government has been ‘printing’ (i.e.creating digitally) trillions of dollars and using it to buy bonds,without causing inflation (Holland et al., 2020). This supportsunintentionally the broad approach to macroeconomics ofModern Monetary Theory (MMT) (Kelton, 2020; Mitchellet al., 2019),i which argues that sovereign states that issue theirown fiat currenciesii are not like households in being constrainedto spend only their revenue. Instead, they can create debt-freemoney, so long as they manage their currency so that it retainsits value. If governments spend beyond the capacity of their econ-omy to produce, then, and only then, inflation becomes a risk.However, economies depressed by the pandemic are operatingwell below capacity. MMT builds on Keynesian economics, theconcept of ‘functional finance’ introduced by Lerner (1943),and the insights of Mosler (2013).Within the framework of MMT, the debt-free process by whichgovernments can create money, sometimes called Overt MonetaryFinancing, is as follows (Mitchell, 2015, p. 364):…governments typically spend by drawing on a bank account they havewith the central bank. An instruction is sent to the central bank fromthe treasury to transfer some funds out of this account into an accountin the private sector, which is held by the recipient of the spending. Asimilar operation might occur when a government cheque is posted to aprivate citizen who then deposits the cheque with their bank. That bankseeks the funds from the central bank, which writes down the govern-ment’s account, and the private bank writes up the private citizen’saccount. All these transactions are done electronically through computersystems.MMT proponents recommend that relevant governments –which include the USA, Canada, UK, Japan and Australia – estab-lish a permanent Job Guarantee programme (Kelton, 2020;Mitchell et al., 2019). People who would be otherwise unemployedwould be paid the minimum wage by the national government forworking in positions established by all tiers of government andnon-profit organisations. The Job Guarantee would stabilise theeconomy by employing more people during downturns, main-taining or enhancing skills until the economy recovers, andemploying fewer people during boom times. Because wageswould be generally less than those paid by the private sector,these new jobs would not compete significantly with existingjobs, and workers in the guaranteed jobs would still have anincentive to seek higher-paid jobs in the private and public sectors(Kelton, 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019).Alexander and Baumann (2020) observe that low-incomeearners, who could practise voluntary simplicity and so participatein degrowth to a steady-state economy, are ‘locked in to a verylong market commitment in order to buy or rent housing’.They propose that, as well as providing unemployed peoplewith a modest living wage, the government should allow themto rent public land and public housing at 25% of their income.Governments of countries that do not have sovereignty overtheir currencies, such as members of the European Union, cannoteasily create money and so may be limited at present to the6 Mark Diesendorfhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/sus.2020.32Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However,the EU could resolve this by changing Article 123 of theMaastricht Treaty to allow Overt Monetary Financing to beused on an ongoing basis (Mitchell, 2015, p. 367).5. ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic has opened up the opportunity for asustainable development recovery. This paper proposes a sustain-able development scenario that brings together key environmentaland social equity aspects, namely climate mitigation and job restor-ation and creation. If we return to pre-COVID economic growthrates and if mitigation methods are limited to technological change,it will be very difficult to keep the global average temperatureincrease above pre-industrial temperatures to 2°C by 2050. It isnow almost certainly too late for human civilisation to transitionsmoothly and without overshoot to an increase of 1.5°C.Therefore, in our scenario, socio-economies follow a path ofdegrowth to a steady-state economy while full employment isensured by means of a Job Guarantee focussed on low-carbon jobs.Degrowth is necessary, because even the low-carbon jobs listedin Table 2 will result in increased economic activity and hence anincrease in emissions. Indeed, increased economic activity insome sectors is essential for post-COVID-19 recovery. Thedilemma can be resolved provided the increase in emissionsfrom low-carbon jobs is more than offset by degrowth in theeconomy at large. This entails rapidly reducing consumptionper person and gradually ending population growth. Degrowthcan be focussed by recognising that the rich 10% of human popu-lation, who comprise a large fraction of developed country inha-bitants and a small fraction of developing country inhabitants, areresponsible for the majority of environmental impacts within theexisting economic system. Policies to address this situationinclude progressive taxation to discourage very high incomes,environmental tax reform including carbon taxes, inheritancetaxes, a shorter working week and fair minimum incomes.Realistically, a mass movement is needed to force governmentsto act against the interests of powerful vested interests and theideology of endless economic growth which has been embeddedin our culture. However, the situation that governments havehad to set aside neoliberal economic ideologies during the pan-demic makes socioeconomic change less difficult.It is even easier for governments to foster low-carbon jobs.They must use strategic planning and incentives/disincentives toencourage appropriate businesses and industries. Many state/provincial and city governments, and several national govern-ments, are already implementing such policies, although notrapidly enough. In particular, policies are needed to accelerateEE and conservation, to provide the infrastructure for renewableelectricity, to shift heating from fossil fuels to electricity, and tofoster public transport, active transport and electric vehicles.Environmental tax reform and a shorter working week wouldhelp drive this component of the strategy.A Job Guarantee can be paid at the minimum wage by nationalgovernments. Labour-intensive jobs can be created by all levels ofgovernment and non-profit organisations mainly in the areas ofcaring for people and caring for the environment. Althoughnational governments could fund the Job Guarantee temporarilyby borrowing while interest rates are low during COVID recovery,a permanent solution for countries that have monetary sover-eignty and are operating below full economic capacity is to createmoney as justified by MMT. Renting public land to low-incomeearners could also contribute to the transition while improvingsocial equity.With strong public pressure on governments and business, ledby environmental, social justice and economic reform NGOs,transition to a 2°C target with full employment may still bepossible.Acknowledgements.
