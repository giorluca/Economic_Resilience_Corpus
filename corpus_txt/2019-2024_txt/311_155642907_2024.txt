106 Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 The Financial Recovery of Region From Economic Disruptions and Resiliency of Real Estate — Construction Sector: A Case Study of Southeast Texas Economy and Real Property Values  Gevorg Sargsyan Lamar University  Enrique Venta Lamar University  James Slaydon Lamar University  Ricardo Colon Lamar University    This study examines the financial recovery of Southeast Texas post-economic disruptions, particularly focusing on the real estate-construction sector's resilience, a key economic driver in the region. It analyzes macroeconomic indicators, emphasizing the sector's role in the region's recovery. The research highlights risk management as crucial for financial resilience in real estate-construction. Three key innovative aspects include: (1) Southeast Texas historically relies on real estate-construction for economic growth, with financial stability linked to major industries. (2) Utilizing the Participatory Analysis of Risk Management (PARM) methodology, focusing on the region's real estate-construction sector. (3) Enhancing PARM results through financial valuation of residential and industrial/commercial properties in Southeast Texas, enabling longitudinal analysis and a deeper understanding of the region's financial stability and resilience. This study underscores the importance of studying the real estate-construction sector for the region's economic well-being post-disruptions.  Keywords: financial recovery, economic disruption, economic growth, resiliency, best practices of risk management, real estate - construction sector, residential and industrial/commercial real estate  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  Economic Growth and Employment in Real Estate in Southeast Texas There is a direct connection between economic growth and the real estate - construction sector in Southeast Texas. The growth of the oil and gas industry has led to massive real estate development and expansion projects, resulting in increased employment in construction and real estate. The importance of the construction and real estate sector in Southeast Texas is confirmed by statistics obtained from the Texas  Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 107 Workforce Commission, where employment in the construction and real estate sector as a percentage of pre-pandemic total employment in Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties was 12.46%, 13.91%, and 12.41%, respectively (Texas Labor Market Highlights, 2019). According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP pre-pandemic growth was 8.6% from 2014 to 2018 in Beaumont-Port Arthur MSA. The same agency data shows a 9.6% increase in per capita personal income in Beaumont-Port Arthur MSA from 2014 to 2018. Population growth in Southeast Texas from 2014 until, the major economic disruption, Hurricane Harvey, was slow but steady. Since the three major economic disruptions, Hurricane Harvey, Tropical Storm Imelda, and the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been small declines in Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties. Table one shows the population changes as a result of Hurricane Harvey, Tropical Storm Imelda, and the COVID-19 pandemic in four counties of Southeast Texas and compares it to Harris County and the state of Texas. The table includes the period of the pandemic lockdown.  TABLE 1 POPULATION IN HARDIN, HARRIS, JEFFERSON, AND ORANGE COUNTIES COVERING THE TIME FRAME OF MAJOR ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN SETX REGION   Hardin Harris Jefferson Orange Beaumont-Port Arthur MSA Texas 2020 58,305 4,738,253 250,127 82,878 391,310 29,360,759 2019 57,796 4,709,243 251,315 83,086 392,197 28,986,794 2018 57,207 4,698,619 255,001 83,572 395,780 28,701,845 2017 57,159 4,664,159 256,591 84,936 398,686 28,322,717 2016 56,260 4,629,189 256,311 84,533 397,104 27,937,492 2015 55,761 4,561,939 255,232 83,946 394,939 27,486,814 2014 55,508 4,458,709 252,915 83,249 391,672 26,977,142 Source: US Census Bureau  Economic Disruptions and their Impact on Real Estate in Southeast Texas Economic disruptions, such as natural disasters and pandemics, directly and negatively impact the construction and real estate sector, therefore, impacting the economic growth of Southeast Texas. First, hurricanes, floods, storms, and other natural disasters cause structural damage to real properties, resulting in decreases in the value of real properties. The decrease in the value of real estate properties depends on the magnitude of the disaster and the volume of damage. Second, economic disruptions such as natural disasters and pandemics affect the supply and demand of rental and for-sale properties disrupting the equilibrium in real estate markets. During the last decade, there was massive expansion and construction in Southeast Texas, which had a significant impact on price equilibrium. In the SETX region demand for industrial/commercial, residential, and other types of properties grew slowly but steadily. Under the conditions of economic disruptions, a decrease in supply and construction in real estate cause causes sharp increases in property sales prices and rents, especially in high-demand locations of Southeast Texas. To demonstrate the negative impact caused by disruptive forces we provide a snapshot of multiple events that caused distress in the economy of Southeast Texas in general and in the real estate - construction sector. Research shows that “the intensive construction and current infrastructure were not prepared to handle more than 51 inches of rain during Hurricane Harvey. (Ramchand and Krishnamoorti, 2017) These factors resulted in Harvey destroying $125 billion worth of property and damaging 148,000 single-family homes and 163,000 apartments. Property growth, damage, and insurance data in Southeast Texas demonstrate the magnitude of real estate growth and the impact of Harvey. COVID-19 created another unprecedented distress for the real estate market of Southeast Texas. At the beginning of the pandemic, supply chain issues caused a shortage of construction materials which increased their prices resulting in unprecedented nationwide inflation in real estate. There is no question that the economy of Southeast Texas 108 Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 is under the influence of regional and national pressures and this study of resiliency and recovery is necessary and timely. Our study discovered that during the above-mentioned disruptions various local governments of the SETX region were concerned by the fact that specific areas of this region are in shortage of residential real properties due to disproportionate growth in the oil and gas industry and real estate-construction sector.  TABLE 2 SNAPSHOT OF PROPERTY GROWTH, DAMAGE, AND INSURANCE IN HARDIN, HARRIS, JEFFERSON, AND ORANGE COUNTIES BEFORE MAJOR ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN THE SETX REGION   Hardin Harris Jefferson Orange Southeast Texas region (3 counties) Population growth, 2000-2016 8,249 1,189,350 2,628 -2 10,875 Housing unit growth, 2000-2016 4,171 453,672 6,472 1,974 12,617 Single-family homes damaged in 2017 2,571 115,286 66,735 5,328 74,634 Multi-family homes damaged in 2017 1 1394 1,461 120 1,582 Mobile homes damaged in 2017 307 269 6,137 28 6,472 National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) participation 8% 14.0% 18.0% 23.5%  Sources: US Census Bureau and Aon Benfield  The population and housing units of Southeast Texas have grown significantly since 2000. The following chart highlights the growth in three counties of Southeast Texas compared with Harris County one of the largest metropolitan areas of Texas.  FIGURE 1 POPULATION GROWTH (LEFT FIGURE) AND HOUSING UNIT GROWTH (RIGHT FIGURE) IN HARDIN, HARRIS, JEFFERSON, AND ORANGE COUNTIES BEFORE MAJOR ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS IN SETX REGION (2000 TO 2016)    It is surprising to observe the low levels of NFIP insurance participation in light of the prevalence of risks in this area.  453,672 4,171 1,974 6,472 1,189,350 8,249 -2 2,628  Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 109 FIGURE 2 POST HARVEY SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES DAMAGE (LEFT FIGURE) AND NFIP PARTICIPATION (RIGHT FIGURE) IN HARDIN, HARRIS, JEFFERSON, AND ORANGE COUNTIES (2017)    This research indicates that Southeast Texas is a resilient region and has recovered from the recent major economic disruptions. However, the speed of recovery varies from community to community. In this study, an analysis of residential property pre- and post-disruption values is conducted for all residential properties in Bevil Oaks, a residential community northwest of Beaumont. Also, researchers analyzed industrial/commercial property pre- and post-disruption values in selected properties in Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties. The analysis was undertaken to provide insight into the effect of economic disruption on residential and industrial/commercial property values.  RESEARCH METHODS  Analysis of Macroeconomic Indicators of Southeast Texas Region The research team obtained macroeconomic data such as GDP by county/metro areas from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and US Census Bureau County Business Patterns and investigated the correlation of this data to the real estate - construction sector. Researchers also obtained information about per capita personal income and real GDP in chained dollars for Hardin, Harris, Jefferson, and Orange counties. The employment data related to the construction and real estate sector came from the Texas Workforce Commission and Texas Labor Market Review. County population trends and data was obtained from the US Census Bureau. Using this data researchers completed a macroeconomic analysis of Southeast Texas to understand the financial and economic recovery of this region after Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda.  Valuation of Residential and Industrial/Commercial Real Property Samples Using the methodology designed by Sargsyan et al, (2019) researchers examined representative samples of residential and industrial/commercial properties in Southeast Texas. A regression model was built to study appraised values of residential and industrial/commercial real properties for pre- and post-Harvey also pre- and post-Imelda periods. In this part of the analysis, the objective was to determine the effect of flooding from Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda on residential and industrial/commercial property values in Southeast Texas. The projections about the long-term impact of 14.0% 8.0% 23.5% 18.0% 115,286 2,571 5,328 66,735 110 Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 the COVID-19 pandemic on the real estate and construction sector are difficult to use when it comes to long-term estimates of the regional trends of SETX under multiple factors including economic disruption, economic growth, and other disruptive forces. Analysis of residential property values pre- and post-storms is conducted for all flooded homes in Bevil Oaks, a residential community. There was a total of 779 real properties in the Bevil Oaks community. Data obtained for all properties have been divided into three groups: (a) improved properties that flooded and were not demolished (rebuilt), (b) properties that flooded and were demolished, and (c) unimproved properties that only consisted of land. Improved properties that flooded and were not demolished were 176 (22.6% of all properties). Seventeen properties (2.1%) that flooded were demolished. The rest of the unimproved properties consisted of farm/agricultural use land or empty lots. Using the same methodology, the valuation of industrial/commercial properties for pre- and post-storms was conducted in 45 flooded properties in Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties.  Participatory Analysis of Risk Management in the Real Estate - Construction Sector of Southeast Texas To complete a comprehensive risk management analysis of the construction and real estate sector this study used the Participatory Analysis of Risk Management (PARM) methodology designed by Sargsyan et al. (2019). PARM method identified risk management practices of recovery and resiliency from natural disasters in the real estate - construction sector. In addition, this tool was used to identify challenges and experiences that stakeholders of the real estate - construction sector faced during major economic disruptions in this region. The core elements of the PARM research tool are (a) participation (the involvement of local stakeholders in research), (b) analysis (research of resiliency and recovery efforts), and (c) risk management (identification of best practices of risk management). These three core elements of PARM methodology facilitated a comprehensive analysis of risk management practices and helped to investigate the recovery and resiliency after major economic distress. The PARM methodology workflow has four stages: (1) research team workshop (preparatory phase), (2) focus group workshops and fieldwork, (3) data analysis, and (4) communication with the local constituency. The results generated by the PARM methodology provide valuable information to stakeholders so they can become more resilient and avoid significant losses during future natural disasters. The results will also help businesses in the real estate - construction sector to develop long-term financial plans which ultimately will lead to enhanced financial stability. This study confirmed one more time that the participatory approach can help design realistic strategies for resiliency and recovery. This research also confirmed that the recovery and resiliency of the real estate - construction sector rely on efficient public-private active engagement, so therefore the participatory approach of involving a large range of stakeholders of the real estate – construction sector provides yet another layer of significance for this study.  Specific Applications and Implications of PARM Methodology to the Real Estate - Construction Sector in Southeast Texas As specified earlier, this study followed the PARM workflow designed by Sargsyan et al. (2019), and the first stage was to establish the research question/goal. The main question/goal of this research was to identify and analyze the risk management practices that the construction and real estate sector businesses implemented during economic disruptions such as natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the research goal, focus group questions were developed: Preparation stage: - What items would you place on a checklist to prepare for upcoming risks of economic disruptions? During disruption: - What risks/problems did you experience during economic disruptions? - What practices did you use to handle situations/manage risks during unforeseen and unpredictable events that cause economic disruption?  Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 111 - What were the most successful risk management strategies that you/your group used during economic disruptions? Why? - Were there risk management strategies that were not as successful that were used during economic disruptions? Why? Recovery stage: - How did you manage the recovery process after economic disruption? What risks or challenges did you encounter during recovery? - What helpful hints do you suggest that will allow rapid recovery from upcoming economic disruption? Role of technology: - What role did technology (including communications) play in response to economic disruption? Which were the most critical technologies? Where do you see the role of technology in managing future economic disruptions? What do you see as the role of technology in the future? Government action: - What actions should local, state, and federal governments take to protect your businesses from unforeseen and unpredictable risks such as natural disasters, pandemics, and other events that cause economic disruptions (“your wish list”)? Figure 3 shows the results of the value chain analysis of Southeast Texas real estate - construction sector. Value chain analysis allowed us to map and identify the major stakeholders of the real estate - construction sector. Among stakeholders are construction firms, residential and industrial/commercial real estate businesses, brokers, financial institutions, local governments, etc. A representative group of the stakeholders of the real estate – construction sector was selected to participate in focus group workshops. In addition to the main players in this sector, researchers also interviewed significant local stakeholders and broad community organizations, including local government officials, public community organizations, and representatives of the oil and gas industry. The findings shown in this work demonstrate the results of interviews with the real estate - construction sector players. These results are combined with input from the rest of the community organizations that have an indirect influence on the real estate – construction sector.

Investing 112 Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION  The Financial and Economic Recovery of Southeast Texas As can be observed from table three, there was a constant and significant growth in employment. This can be explained by a sharp increase in the need for employees involved in construction, rebuilding, and recovery efforts, caused by economic disruptions. For informative reasons, employment in 2010 is included in the last row of the table.

Five-year (2014-2018) growth of per capita personal income was 11.58%, 8.65%, and 11.23% in Hardin, Jefferson, and Orange counties, respectively. Personal income growth is an indication of the growth of economic activity and investments in real estate.

Therefore, the rapid recovery of Jefferson County is key to overcoming economic hardship and decline after Hurricane Harvey. Although Tropical Storm Imelda was a disaster comparable to Harvey, the Southeast Texas region recovered much more quickly, in part due to what was learned in recovering from Harvey. The COVID-19 pandemic caused fundamentally different economic disruption than natural  Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 113 disasters due to its rare nature, long distress, and severe economic disruption. Many of the strategies used to deal with economic disruptions during natural disasters added value and have been used during recovery from economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The losses in value represent a significant decrease in homeowners’ equity. As can be observed from the following figure the decrease of residential real estate properties in comparison to industrial/commercial real estate properties was sharp and rapid. The recovery was not as steep as during the economic disruption and took a long time.  FIGURE 4 ANALYSIS OF VALUES OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES IN SETX   Source: Jefferson County Appraisal District  In contrast to residential real estate properties, the decline in industrial/commercial real estate properties was not as steep and the recovery was rapid, leading to stable real estate values. Residential values need insurance proceeds and the availability of contractors for recovery. Industrial/commercial properties often use operating funds to ensure immediate recovery and provide business continuity.     - 20,000.00 40,000.00 60,000.00 80,000.00 100,000.00 120,000.00 140,000.00 160,000.002015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Mean114 Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 FIGURE 5 ANALYSIS OF VALUES OF INDUSTRIAL/COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES IN SETX   Source: Jefferson County Appraisal District  In-Depth Interviews and Focus Group Workshops With Stakeholders of the Real Estate - Construction Sector of Southeast Texas After the economic distress caused by Hurricane Rita in 2005 (which was mostly a wind event), businesses learned and gained experience in securing existing properties and building new ones to ensure less damage from wind (stronger structure, wind-resilient technology, and materials). Following Hurricane Rita’s devastation, the state changed the building and design norms of properties to protect them from wind events. The requirement to protect property from windstorm damage caused the development costs to increase significantly since they had to design and build stronger foundations, framing, and roofs to secure the property from hurricane-level winds.  Economic disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda are very different events by their nature, in contrast to Hurricane Rita. Both Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda were unprecedented flood events, and both the Southeast Texas infrastructure and properties were not designed to handle that much floodwater. After Hurricane Harvey, the state and local governments worked together to raise the standards again to make sure that if a Harvey or Imelda-type event happened again, the infrastructure and real estate properties would be much more resilient to flooding. The drainage and building elevation requirements have been changed significantly. The changes in construction requirements again impacted the increase in the cost of real estate development. Economic distress caused by COVID-19 was unprecedented and had a long-lasting disruption to the activities of many businesses and households. However, it is important to note that economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic did not impact the structure of the real estate properties. During these economic disruptions, different real estate businesses and households had different experiences including:  - loss of tenants, - significant property damage, - uninsured losses, - loss of initial investment resulting in having to start the development projects and, in some cases, re-build properties all over again, - financing issues, - delays, and backlogs in compensations of insured losses and FEMA, 2000002200002400002600002800003000003200003400003600002015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020APPRAISED VALUEYEARMean Journal of Applied Business and Economics Vol. 26(2) 2024 115 - standing flood water stayed in the properties for several days, old properties started settling, and other properties started to have foundation problems.

The real estate market always tends to follow a cyclical and interconnected trend between the industrial/commercial, and residential segments. In Southeast Texas, where the energy sector is a major contributor to this region’s economy and job market, construction and expansion of oil and gas production has a higher effect on the real estate market. Frequent economic disruptions in Southeast Texas cause long-lasting distress to business activity and negatively impact real estate values in this region. This study found that it takes a significant amount of resources and time to “recover and rebuild” from economic disruptions. This study also found that industrial/commercial properties have been repaired and recovered quicker as the businesses in those properties couldn’t stay shut down for a long time. For residential properties, the repairs and recovery process took longer time in comparison to industrial/commercial properties.  It is worth noting that, catastrophes also result in opportunities for developers. Multiple real estate developers and investors benefited from these events and situations. There are cases where entire neighborhoods of damaged buildings have been successfully re-developed. The risk management best practices during previous economic disruptions show the positive impact of collaboration, communication, and interaction between public and private parties involved in the real estate sector. Sharing knowledge, new technologies, and best practices is a key to resiliency. Real estate businesses need to innovate and should have an entrepreneurial spirit to be resilient and recover from economic disruptions. Further application of new technologies (including information technologies) is key to developing sustainable and resilient neighborhoods.  CONCLUSION  Recovery efforts and investments in resiliency can offset the financial losses and declines caused by economic disruptions. Rebuilding and construction can lead to an economic boom, positively influencing the regional economy’s GDP, personal income, employment, and population growth. Due to frequent economic disruptions, Southeast Texas developed resilient communities and businesses. Those businesses that operate in industrial/commercial real estate properties developed “immunity” to frequent economic disruptions that occurred in the past. They re-use the best practices of risk management learned from previous disruptions to overcome challenges of the next economic distress. This study also highlights the need for more efficient use of available risk management tools such as public and private insurance. Sustainable and resilient management of the real estate construction sector is necessary to minimize losses from events that cause economic disruptions.
