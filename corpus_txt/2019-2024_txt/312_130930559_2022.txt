Real Estate Agents and Brokers - Recovery from a Seller for Tortious Interference with a Broker\\\\u27s Reasonable Expectancy of Economic Benefit Must Be Based on a Brokerage Agreement Enforceable Under the Statute of Frauds - McCann v. Biss, 65 N.J. 301 (1974).

REAL ESTATE AGENTS AND BROKERS--RECOVERY FROM ASELLER FOR TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH A BROKER'SREASONABLE EXPECTANCY OF ECONOMIC BENEFIT MUST BEBASED ON A BROKERAGE AGREEMENT ENFORCEABLE UNDER THESTATUTE OF FRAUDS-McCann v. Biss, 65 N.J. 301 (1974).On June 19, 1971, Steven and Joan Biss executed a contractfor the sale of their home to Ernest and Elaine Wuester for$36,900, and title was later closed.' Nell McCann, trading as NellMcCann Realty, subsequently filed a complaint in the BergenCounty District Court, naming the Bisses and the Wuesters asdefendants. 2 Claiming that she had been the efficient cause of thesale, McCann sued for the commission allegedly due her.3 At trial,the factual dispute focused upon the nature of the relationshipbetween the sellers and the plaintiff, the significance of the actionsof the plaintiff on behalf of the buyers or the sellers, and the legalramifications of the relationship between the buyers and the plain-tiff.4 It was undisputed that there was neither a written real estate' McCann v. Biss, 65 N.J. 301, 307, 322 A.2d 161, 164 (1974).2 Id. at 303, 322 A.2d at 162.3 Id.4 See id. at 305-07, 322 A.2d at 163-64. Justice Hall, speaking for the court, noted thatthe confusing and contradictory testimony made it "exceedingly difficult to determine thefull truth." Id. at 305, 322 A.2d at 163.This is demonstrated by a summary of the events leading up to the litigation: Late in thespring of 1971 the Bisses ran advertisements in several local newspapers for the sale of theirhouse in West Milford, N.J. These ads resulted in visits by a great number of prospectivebuyers (some accompanied by brokers) and brokers seeking to represent the Bisses. Appar-ently "[tihere were so many they could not differentiate between them and they generallydid not ask who the visitors were." Id. at 303, 305, 322 A.2d at 162-63. One advertisementwas seen by plaintiff's saleswoman, who testified that she telephoned Mr. Biss and attemptedto negotiate an exclusive listing agreement, but that he would agree only to an open listingwhich merely grants the broker permission to produce an acceptable buyer. This arrange-ment was denied by Mr. Biss. Id. at 306, 322 A.2d at 163.The plaintiffs saleswoman further testified that she later inspected the home with Mr.Biss and prepared a listing card quoting the asking price of $37,500 and the net price of$35,000. Mr. Biss denied this conversation. Mrs. Wuester testified that she was shown thehouse by the same saleswoman, but due to the number of visitors, the Bisses could neitherconfirm nor deny that testimony. It was also alleged by the plaintiff that a few days later, hersaleswoman met with the Wuesters and that an offer was made by phone to Mr. Biss for$37,000, which he refused. This too was denied, but it should be noted that the Wuestersdid not confirm the making of the offer or the phone call; it is not clear whether they wereasked to so testify. Id. at 306-07, 322 A.2d at 163-64.When the saleswoman called Mr. Biss a few weeks later, she was informed that thehouse had been sold, but Biss did not identify the buyers. It is not clear whether he wasasked their identity. When Mrs. Wuester was called, she falsely told the plaintiff that she andher husband had decided to rent instead of buy. The Wuesters testified that during thesubsequent negotiations between the two parties, Mr. Biss had stated that he did not want a394NOTESbrokerage agreement signed by the Bisses, authorizing the plaintiffto represent them in the sale of their house, nor a written notice bythe broker confirming an oral agreement, as required by sectionnine of the New Jersey statute of frauds.5 It was established at thetrial that Mrs. Wuester visited the Biss home accompanied by theplaintiff's saleswoman; 6 that Mr. Biss knew the plaintiff was in-terested in representing him; 7 and that the house was purchasedby the Wuesters directly from the Bisses.8In her suit, McCann attempted to establish liability in bothcontract and tort.9 Plaintiff's allegation that the buyers hadbroker involved in the transaction. In the signed contract the Wuesters represented " 'thatno broker brought about the sale of this property.' " Id. at 307, 322 A.2d at 164.5 Id. at 306, 322 A.2d at 163. See N.J. STAT.

Biss, 65 N.J. 301, 306, 322 A.2d 161, 163 (1974). Whether such an oralagreement is void, voidable, or unenforceable has not been answered with any consistency inNew Jersey. See Harris v. Perl, 41 N.J. 455, 461, 197 A.2d 359, 363 (1964) (voidable); C. B.Snyder Realty Co. v. Nat'l Newark & Essex Banking Co., 14 N.J. 146, 165, 101 A.2d 544,554 (1953) (unenforceable); Louis Kamm, Inc. v. Flink, 113 N.J.L. 582, 591, 175 A. 62, 68(Ct. Err. & App. 1934) (void). The McCann court termed the alleged contract between thebroker and the sellers as both void and unenforceable. McCann v.

Id. But see note 81 infra,regarding the constructive knowledge of a prospective purchaser that the broker will receivea commission if he is the efficient cause of a subsequent sale.' McCann v. Biss, 65 N.J. 301, 306, 322 A.2d 161, 163 (1974). The Bisses, however,testified that no broker had been authorized to act for them in executing the sale. Thesupreme court was of the opinion that "they wished to sell the property themselves and didnot desire the services of a broker."

It has been held that a suit against a seller to recover for a broker'sSETON HALL LAW REVIEW [Vol. 6:394breached an implied contract with her to complete the transactionwas dismissed by the trial judge. 10 Claims were also brought againstthe buyers and the sellers in tort alleging that they had intention-ally and unjustifiably "interfered with a reasonable expectancy ofeconomic advantage or benefit on the part of the broker."11 Thelatter was the only -issue decided by the jury,' 2 which found infavor of the buyers and against the sellers and awarded the plain-tiff approximately six percent of the selling price of the house.'3The sellers appealed the tortious interference judgmentagainst them, but the plaintiff did not appeal the judgment ren-dered in favor of the buyers on that issue. Plaintiff did, however,cross-appeal the dismissal of the implied contract claim against thebuyer.14 The appellate division sustained the judgment in favor ofthe buyers and reversed the judgment against the sellers as totortious interference, remanding the cause for entry of final judg-ment.' 5 The New Jersey supreme court granted the plaintiff'spetition for certification 6 on the question whether the absence of awritten seller-broker contract will prevent a real estate broker frombringing an action against a seller for tortious interference with thebroker's prospective economic advantage. 17 Also certified was theservices rendered pursuant to an oral agreement by bringing the action in quantum meruitis merely an attempt to evade the statute and will not be permitted.

Biss"9 held that, "as a generalproposition," a real estate broker who cannot recover a commissionfrom a seller because of noncompliance with the statute of fraudscannot avoid the statute by suing the seller for "wrongful interfer-ence with the broker's reasonable expectancy of economic ben--efit. '" 20 It further held that, under the facts of this case, there wasno implied contract between the buyers and the broker requiringthe buyers to pay the commission if the broker could not legallycollect from the sellers. 2' As to the sellers' liability, the courtreasoned that since the "expected economic benefit" of a broker-his commission-is normally conditioned upon the existence of avalid written listing agreement, no action could lie for interferencewith that expectation when the agreement failed because of non-compliance with the statute of frauds.22 As to the buyers' liability,the implied contract theory was said to be "patently frivolous" andThese torts have usually involved interference by third parties, not by one of the partiesto the transaction.

The McCann court stated:"(2) If a statute provides that a person employing another for a specifiedpurpose shall not be liable to the other for compensation although the otherrenders the promised performance, unless the employer has signed a memoran-dum in writing, a person has no duly to pay to another whom he orally employs forsuch purpose either the promised compensation or the reasonable value of servicesrendered."Comment (b) ... is particularly pertinent:"b. Statutes similar to the one referred to in this Subsection are not in-frequently enacted with reference to contracts with real estate brokers. Thememorandum commonly required under such statutes is one which describes thething to be sold and the terms of compensation. In the absence of such amemorandum, the employer, although benefited by the service of the agent whohas been orally employed by him, is under no duty to give compensation in anyform. ***The rule stated in this Subsection differs radically from that applying to theordinary Statutes of Frauds. Its purpose is to protect against fraudulent claims forservices; if the broker were entitled to obtain the value of services the statute wouldnot have the effect intended.

For a discussion of Dobbs as it relates to McCann see notes 80-84 infraand accompanying text.24 The section of New Jersey's statute of frauds governing real estate brokerage agree-ments was originally adopted in 1873, Law of March 13, 1873, ch. 215, ยง 1, [1873] N.J.

Hawkins, Where, Why and When Was the Statute of Frauds Enacted?, 54 AM. L. REV. 867,869 (1920). The author stated:In fact, so many transactions of daily life were carried out without the aid ofany writing that in order to prove any debt, the ownership of land, or to substan-tiate the validity of many contracts by unmistakable and indisputable evidence itbecame necessary to call for the testimony of eye witnesses, who had nothing toassist their memories outside of hazy recollections and could tell the jury somethingfar different from the actual facts. Under such circumstances collusion, false swear-ing and actual fraud, perpetrated by subordination [sic] of perjury, was the generaloutcome, while the plaintiff in a case would get very little for his pains.Id. (footnote omitted)." Sadler v. Young, 78 N.J.L. 594, 597, 75 A. 890, 891 (Ct. Err. & App. 1910). Theprotections afforded to sellers, however, have on occasion been abused. For example, inNoonan v. Henry, 97 N.J.L. 447, 117 A. 393 (Sup. Ct. 1922), the court observed:This statute was enacted for the protection of the landowner. It, however, wasfrequently used by landowners to deprive brokers of commissions which they hadrightfully earned.Id. at 448-49, 117 A. at 394 (dictum).

This commentator asserted:The purpose of the statute is quite apparent, but it must be remembered that1975] NOTESestate brokerage agreements has been attacked as discriminatory,since there are no similar 'statutory provisions regulating otherprofessions. 28  Despite these and other criticisms,29  statutes offrauds relating to broker-seller agreements remain in force inmany jurisdictions.3 0Although under certain circumstances a broker may recoverthe value of his commission from a seller on tort grounds despitethe requirements of section nine of the statute of frauds,3 ' thatstatute bars recovery where the broker has grounded his claimsspecifically on interference with an oral contract. In C. B. SnyderRealty Co. v.

WILLISTON, LAW OF CONTRACTS ยง 448, at 347 (3d ed. 1960),where reference is made to the statute of frauds in general as "warped and twisted bymisconception and misapplication."" See Lasser, Real Estate Broker's Commission--Oral Agreements and the Statute of Frauds, 10RUTGERS L. REv. 410 (1955). Professor Lasser has mounted a particularly vehement attackon section nine of New Jersey's statute of frauds, calling it a "severe form of occupationalregulation." Id. at 410. He "[c]ompare[d] the unfortunate position of the real estate brokerwith" that of the more fortunate securities broker who is "unhampered by a writingrequirement." Id. at 412. Noting the importance of mutual trust between a broker and hisclient, he stated:Often a broker will not jeopardize his relations with the owner by suggesting thatthe commission agreement be in writing. When businessmen pride themselves ontheir integrity and ability to conduct their business with a handshake, they areinsulted by the inference of a request that a commission agreement be reduced towriting.Id. The author further emphasized that an unscrupulous seller could manipulate the statuteof frauds to deprive a real estate broker of his commission:The owner of a desirable property can induce a real estate broker to perform hisservices and procure a sale. The owner may then remain behind the protectivebulwark of the Statute of Frauds where he can force a settlement with the broker ata figure lower than the usual commission, or defeat the demand for commissionentirely.Id. at 412-13.29 See, e.g., Stevens, Ethics and the Statute of Frauds, 37 CORNELL L.Q. 355 (1952). In thisarticle Dean Stevens raised the ethical problems involved in the practical application ofstatutes of frauds in litigation. Specifically, he observed that the lawyer faces a dilemmawhen he knows an oral agreement exists, yet must plead the statute of frauds as a defensefor his client at the expense of an innocent party-"[c]onscience tells him that the practice iswrong, but the literature from insurance companies reminds him of liability for malprac-tice." Id. at 356. The author further notes that "[t]he decisions and texts are replete with thestatement that the statute was intended to be used as a shield, not a sword."

Louis Kamm, Inc.v. Flink 42 is representative of such situations. There, the plaintiffbroker had brought an action against the president of a buildingand loan association (the seller) and two other brokers, all of whomallegedly were responsible for depriving him of his commission.43That portion of the action grounded in tortious interference al-leged three wrongs: that after the plaintiff had confidentially dis-closed to the president the identity of a prospective purchaser, thedefendants acted in concert to induce the association to exclude theplaintiff from further negotiations; 44 that the defendants stole theplaintiffs customer; and that they " 'unlawfully, improperly andmaliciously interfered with plaintiffs relation with'" the prospectivebuyer. 45 The Court of Errors and Appeals 46 held that, even inthe absence of a "formal contractual relationship" between thebroker and the association, 47 the action for unjustifiable interfer-ence with the business pursuits of the plaintiff did state a validcause of action in tort.48 The alleged acts of the defendants wereviewed as an infringement upon the plaintiffs property right topursue a business, and the court declared that "natural justice"would require a remedy in such circumstances. 4 " Discerning over-tones of "sharp dealing" by the defendants, the court noted thatthe allegations permitted an inference that the president of theassociation sought to gain a pecuniary advantage from his interfer-ence and that such motive evidenced malice.50It is important to note that, although the president appears tohave had the agency power to act for the association, 5 ' the latter42 113 N.J.L. 582, 175 A. 62 (Ct.

Wilson, 53 for example, concerned a sellerwho had deceived his broker by not disclosing that another partyheld a prior option on the real property being offered for sale.5 4The broker brought an action for his commission in contract andin deceit.5 5 Reversing the trial court's dismissal of the action, thesupreme court held that, although the brokerage agreement wasoral and recovery on the contract was barred by the statute offrauds, 56 the case would be remanded because the business lossincurred by plaintiff due to defendant's allegedly deceitful rep-resentation stated an actionable claim.5 7 The court commented that[t]he charge is not made to enforce the contents of the oralagreement but to compensate the plaintiff for its loss engen-dered by the deceit.58It further indicated in dictum that in a proper case, where thedeceit "permeate[s] the contractual relationship between the par-ties," it would consider the possibility of overriding the statute offrauds, thereby permitting contractual recovery in order to reach anequitable result. 59 Thus, in Kamm and Schlesinger, despite the ab-sence or the failure of the underlying contract, the brokers wereheld to state an actionable claim because the defendants acted in apower to manage that property and to act as agent in the sale of the association's real estateassets.

Perl.68In that case the court held that the broker could recover from thebuyer despite the absence not only of a formal brokerage contract,but of any business relationship whatsoever with the seller.6 9 Thebuyer in Harris had been shown the property by the plaintiffbroker and had discussed price terms. The buyer subsequentlylearned that the purported owner had transferred title to his bankin satisfaction of a mortgage debt.70 Plaintiff broker, however, wasunaware of this situation and believed the apparent owner hadauthority to sell. 71 The buyer quickly made his offer directly to thebank and promptly signed a contract of sale, representing thereinthat no broker had shown him the property on behalf of thebank. 72 The broker brought suit against the buyer on the groundof tortious interference. 73 Although the facts indicated that plain-tiff had neither a written contract with the purported seller norany business relationship with the actual seller, 74 the New Jerseysupreme court held that where a buyer deprives a broker of hiscommission by dealing directly with the seller, thereby "appropriat-68 41 N.J. 455, 197 A.2d 359 (1964).69 Id. at 464, 197 A.2d at 364.70 Id. at 458, 197 A.2d at 361.71 Id. at 459, 197 A.2d at 361.72 Id. at 460-61, 197 A.2d at 362.

If the buyer breaches the contract with the seller without goodcause, he becomes liable to the broker for the commission based onthe breach of the implied contract.8 3 Although generally thebroker's commission is extracted from the proceeds of the sale, insuch a case of wrongful default by the buyer, the court will holdhim responsible for compensating a broker who has in all respectsdone his job.8 4The cases above demonstrate that, with the exception of aDobbs-type contractual remedy, the general theory of recoveryagainst either seller or buyer, absent an enforceable brokerageagreement, has focused upon the tortious conduct of the offendingparty as the basis for compensating the broker for his lost commis-sion. McCann restricts the extension of this tort theory of recovery.As to seller liability, the court explained that at the root of anyclaims by a broker for tortious interference there must necessarilyhave occurred an injury to a contractual expectation cognizableboth, and both know the broker expects to earn a commission from the seller if hesucceeds. The broker's stock in trade is his knowledge of what property is or can bemade available and who is or can be interested in a given parcel. The inherentuniqueness of each parcel distinguishes the real estate broker from the salesman ofautomobiles or cutlery, for the very act of identifying real property or the prospec-tive purchaser is itself both a rendition of a valuable service and an opportunity fora dishonest man to make off with the broker's stock in trade.Id. at 462-63, 197 A.2d at 363-64.The major thrust of the holding in Dobbs, however, was the promulgation of a ruleprecisely defining the point at which the seller becomes liable to the broker for his commis-sion when a valid brokerage agreement exists:When a broker is engaged by an owner of property to find a purchaser for it, thebroker earns his commission when (a) he produces a purchaser ready, willing andable to buy on the terms fixed by the owner, (b) the purchaser enters into a bindingcontract with the owner to do so, and (c) the purchaser completes the transaction byclosing the title in accordance with the provisions of the contract.50 N.J. at 551, 236 A.2d at 855. If the buyer defaults, the seller is not liable for thecommission; but if the contract is not completed because of a "wrongful act or interferenceof the seller," the seller must pay the commission.

Super. 471, 479-81, 282 A.2d 775, 779-80(App. Div. 1971), where the court held the seller liable even when a contract of sale had notbeen executed. See generally Note, Ellsworth Dobbs, Inc. v.

Id.84 Id. at 558-59, 236 A.2d at 859. The buyer's implied contract with the broker in such acase is independent of the buyer's contract with the seller; thus, it is irrelevant whether ornot the seller sues the buyer for breach-the broker may still seek his commission from thebuyer. Id. at 556-57, 560, 236 A.2d at 858, 860. An exception to this general principle wouldoccur when the seller successfully sues the buyer for a "substantial" sum.

In the case of a contract rendered voidand unenforceable because of noncompliance with the statute offrauds, a broker cannot avoid the statute by suing in tort.85The court further asserted that the statute of frauds wasenacted primarily to protect the seller, and it stressed the impor-tance of placing the risk of loss on the broker.8 6 Adopting languageof the Restatement (Second) of Agency, the court noted that"[b]rokers are professionals; it is not unfair to deprive them of compensa-tion if they do not adopt the safeguards of which they should be aware."'Although the McCann court effectively limited the cir-cumstances under which a broker may recover on tortious inter-ference grounds, it did distinguish cases which had permitted thebroker to recover in tort against the seller."' It reasoned that thesecases involved "peculiar factual and legal situations" beyond theambit of the issues presented in McCann."' For example, its analysisof Schlesinger specifically denominated the action there as one basedon deceit, implying that the holding should be narrowly appliedand would be inapposite to cases such as McCann where there wasno evidence or allegation of deceit. 90 Another case, Brenner & Co.v. Perl,9' serves to underscore the McCann court's concern with the85 65 N.J. at 310, 322 A.2d at 165-66. But see Sustick v. Slatina, 48 N.J. Super. 134, 137A.2d 54 (App. Div. 1957), where the facts were similar to those in McCann, but the seller didnot plead the statute of frauds as an affirmative defense. The appellate division sustainedthe judgment of the trial court against both sellers and buyers. Since the statute was notpleaded, the court could, as a matter of law, treat the brokerage agreement as valid andproceed unhampered by the restrictions of the statute. Id. at 138-41, 137 A.2d at 56-58.Discussing the liability of the seller in this case, the Slatina court stated:He knew plaintiff had a prospective purchaser, he promised him a commission,learned the name and address of the purchasers from him, but then acted inconcert with the Slatinas for the purpose of profiting by the elimination of plain-tiff's commission, without giving plaintiff a reasonable opportunity to bring theparties together at a mutually satisfactory price.Id. at 145, 137 A.2d at 60.88 See 65 N.J. at 308-10, 322 A.2d at 165.87 Id. at 310, 322 A.2d at 165 (quoting from RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY ยง 468,comment b, at 399 (1958)) (emphasis by court).

None of these elements was specifically found in McCann.91 72 N.J. Super. 160, 178 A.2d 19 (App. Div. 1962). This was an appeal by the brokerof a summary judgment in favor of the seller.

In Brenner, thebroker was allowed to bring an action for recovery of his commis-sion from a seller where, during the term of a valid listing agree-ment, there was an "unmistakable inference" that the sellers hadinduced the buyers to withhold their offer until the listing agree-ment expired, thus depriving the broker of his commission.9" Al-though there could be no recovery on the expired contract, 93 thewriting was evidence of a valid business expectation. As such, anywrongful interference with that expectation was deemed an action-able tort.94It should be noted that Kamm was not discussed in the opinionin McCann, and was relied on solely for the premise that in "ap-propriate real estate brokerage matters" a claim for tort will lie. 95While the McCann court viewed Kamm as the case authority for thegeneral validity of such tortious interference actions, it apparentlydid not deem it necessary to reconcile the two cases. 96 Indeed, likeSchlesinger and Brenner, Kamm serves to illustrate situations in whichthe application of the statute of frauds is deemed inappropriate.As to buyer liability, the McCann court rejected the plaintiffscontention that the implied contract theory enunciated in Dobbscould be applied against the buyers.9 7 Distinguishing that case, it92 Id. at 166, 178 A.2d at 22. The defendant had notified the plaintiff that he was goingto advertise the house himself, whereupon the plaintiff sent him a list of persons who hadbeen shown the house by plaintiffs personnel. He informed the defendant that he expecteda six percent commission if the house were sold to any one of those persons. The name ofthe subsequent purchasers appeared on that list. In addition, the purchasers told thedefendant that they had been there with the plaintiff's agent. Id. at 164-65, 178 A.2d at 21.93 Id. at 165-66, 178 A.2d at 22." The Brenner court did not state that its reasoning was based on interference with abusiness expectancy; but this may be inferred from its reliance on Louis Schlesinger Co. v.Rice, 4 N.J. 169, 179-82, 72 A.2d 197, 202-03 (1950), where the decision was couched largelyin terms of malicious interference with the plaintiff broker's contract by the owner andanother broker. See 72 N.J. Super. at 167-68, 178 A.2d at 22-23. Compare 4 N.J. at 179-82, 72A.2d at 202-03 with Louis Kamm, Inc. v. Flink, 113 N.J.L. 582, 175 A. 62 (Ct.

Specifically, allof the parties in Kamm were professionals who were familiar with real estate transactions. Inaddition, the conduct of the defendants in Kamm was alleged to have been particularlyoffensive. See 113 N.J.L. at 595, 175 A. at 69-70. Most important, all of the defendants inthat case were viewed as strangers to the brokerage agreement, thus eliminating the need fora consideration of the effect of section nine. See note 52 supra and accompanying text. InMcCann, only the plaintiff was a professional; the conduct of the defendants was not seen asbeing especially egregious, and the statute of frauds was the focal point of the litigation.97 65 N.J. at 312-13, 322 A.2d at 167.noted that Dobbs involved a valid brokerage agreement, a contractof sale effectuated by the broker, and default by the buyer. Incontrast, these circumstances were absent in McCann and the sellerwas not legally bound to use or pay the broker. The court reasonedthat the mere fact that the broker could not legally collect hiscommission from the seller did not in itself imply a promise to payit by the buyer.98In addition to its discussion of the implied contract approachto buyer liability, the court expressly endorsed cases holding abuyer liable in tort where his interference caused the broker tobe excluded from the transaction and resulted in a wrongfulpecuniary advantage to himself equivalent to the lost commission.99From those cases can be derived the proposition that the moreclosely the alleged advantage to the buyer approaches the amountof the broker's lost prospective commission, the more likely is theinference that the broker was excluded in order to reduce thepurchase price by the amount of the commission.' 0 To negativethat inference a defendant buyer would contend that he gainednothing by excluding the broker because he would not have paid ahigher price and the seller would not have accepted less. Such wasthe argument propounded by the buyers in Harris,t'0 but there thecourt held that they could not "avoid real damages by raising anissue made hypothetical by [their] very wrong."'1 2 In McCann, thecourt was satisfied that the buyers did not gain a pecuniary advan-tage corresponding to the commission and that had a differentprice been demanded by either party "there would have been nodeal.' 0 3 It appears from this language that, even if the conduct of91 Id.

This raises the question of whether the McCann court wouldhave reversed the judgment in favor of the buyers if the pecuniary advantage had, bychance, corresponded to the amount of the expected commission. It should be noted,however, that because of the contradictory nature of the evidence, it is difficult to determinejust how much money was saved by the exclusion of the broker. Apparently deeming Harris'rationale inapplicable, the supreme court in McCann declared that no pecuniary advantagewas gained because "the sellers received the lowest net figure they were willing to accept andthe buyers paid the highest price they would agree to."

Thus, in a case where abroker has no cause of action against a seller insulated by the statute of frauds, it is unlikelythat a buyer could successfully sue the seller for contribution even though the seller mayhave acted in concert with the buyer to deprive the broker of his commission.108 65 N.J. at 312, 322 A.2d at 167. See 50 N.J. at 538-39, 236 A.2d at 848.109 65 N.J. at 312, 322 A.2d at 167. The court, noting that in Dobbs there was a validbrokerage agreement, a contract of sale with a buyer produced by the broker, and default bythat buyer, stated that "under such circumstances" a buyer-broker contract would be implied.Id. (emphasis added).It is interesting to note that the plaintiff in McCann attempted to establish additionalliability against the sellers by alleging that they had induced the buyers to breach theirimplied contract with her. The court, having found no implied contract to breach, rejectedthe theory. Id. at 313 n.5, 322 A.2d at 167."' There, it was said that an implied contract existed1975] NOTESThus, it is not clear whether the court is simply restating the factsof Dobbs in order to distinguish them from the facts of McCann, orwhether it is distilling from Dobbs a rule that even in an impliedcontract action, a written brokerage agreement is needed as evi-dence of an enforceable contractual expectancy."'Another issue left unsettled in McCann is the degree of pe-cuniary advantage which must accrue to the buyer in order to giverise to the presumption that the buyer dealt directly with the sellersolely to deprive the broker of his commission. While McCannimplies that to hold the buyer liable in such a case the pecuniaryadvantage must correspond to the commission," 2 no clear stan-dard has been promulgated. Thus, pecuniary advantage, while itmay serve as a useful indicator of buyer misconduct, cannot beviewed as a clear-cut test.McCann v. Biss serves to warn real estate brokers and attorneysthat a broker's suit against a seller for tortious interference with aprospective economic advantage will probably not be successful ifthe broker-seller agreement has not been reduced to a writing inconformance with the statute of frauds." 3 The McCann court haswhen a prospective buyer solicits a broker to find or to show him property which hemight be interested in buying, and the broker finds property satisfactory to himwhich the owner agrees to sell at the price offered, and the buyer knows the brokerwill earn commission for the sale from the owner ....50 N.J. at 559, 236 A.2d at 859." This ambiguity raises the question: How would the McCann court decide a caseidentical to Dobbs in all respects, except for the existence of a written brokerage agreement?Since the court in McCann places so much emphasis on the broker's duty as a professional toobtain a written brokerage agreement upon which to base his business expectancy, it isprobable that, were such a case to arise, the court would not hold the buyer liable, eventhough, as a stranger to the agreement, he could not raise the statute of frauds as a defense."I See 65 N.J. at 313 n.4, 322 A.2d at 167."3 The National Association of Real Estate Boards has reflected a concern with theneed for written brokerage agreements in its code:The Realtor, for the protection of all parties with whom he deals, should see thatfinancial obligations and commitments regarding real estate transactions are inwriting, expressing the exact agreement of the parties; and that copies of suchagreements, at the time they are executed, are placed in the hands of all partiesinvolved.NATIONAL ASS'N OF REAL ESTATE BOARDS, CODE OF ETHics art. 10 (1962). Conspicuouslyabsent from the code, however, is any suggestion to the broker that a major reason forobtaining a written brokerage agreement is to protect himself.The New Jersey Real Estate Commission currently lacks sufficient funds to enable it toapprise real estate brokers of recent developments such as the holding in McCann. It isexpected, though, that when funds become available, the Commission will institute a systemof dissemination of such information. Letter from John J. Regan, Secretary-Director of theNew Jersey Real Estate Commission, to author, Dec. 24, 1974, on file at Seton Hall LawReview.At least one local realty organization has informed its members of the McCann decision.See Lasser, Realty News in the Courts, THE REALTOR, Oct. 1974, at 3-5 (The Realtor is a monthlySETON HALL LAW REVIEWnot changed the law but has attempted to clarify the decisions inthis area, and by its forceful reaffirmation ofthe statute of frauds,has taken the holding in Snyder one step further. In addition toSnyder's refusal to allow recovery for interference with an unen-forceable brokerage agreement, 1 4 McCann now precludes a brokerfrom recovering under the more general theory of interferencewith a prospective economic advantage, since the court will lookbeyond that claim for an underlying contractual expectation.The McCann decision further insulates the real estate sellerfrom liability and rejects a theory which would make the buyer aguarantor of the broker's commission. While brokers may view thisas unduly restrictive, they need only comply with the provisionsof section nine of the New Jersey statute of frauds in order fully toprotect themselves.Edmond M. Koninpublication of the Real Estate Board of Newark, Irvington, and northern Hillside, NewJersey). After reviewing the facts and holding in McCann, the author stated:In the absence of a written brokerage commission agreement, the broker was thusin a position where it could not prevent the buyer and the seller from concludingthe sale transaction, leaving out the broker.The conclusion and the moral is [sic] obvious.Id. at 5. For the above author's earlier comments on the statute of frauds see note 28 supra." See notes 32-41 supra and accompanying text. The McCann court stated that itsholding was "dictated and was foreshadowed" by its earlier opinion in Snyder. 65 N.J. at 310,322 A.2d at 166.
