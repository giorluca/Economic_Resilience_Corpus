PUERTO RICO’S SECOND-CLASS STATEHOOD: THE IMPACT OF PUERTO RICO’S RESTRICTED ACCESS TO FEDERAL PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS ON PUERTO RICO’S ECONOMIC RECOVERY  EVETTE OCASIO   INTRODUCTION Often forgotten on the mainland, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is the largest United States territory and home to over 3.1 million residents.1 Although residents of Puerto Rico have enjoyed naturalized U.S. citizenship for over 100 years,2 the federal government has yet to grant them equal treatment. Puerto Rico’s residents cannot vote in federal elections, nor do they have representation in Congress.3 The federal government also limits, and in some cases entirely precludes, funding allotments to Puerto Rico for many federal public benefits programs that make up the U.S. “social safety net.”4 These programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), are essential to those with  1 U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts: Puerto Rico, https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/PR# (last visited Dec. 12, 2020). 2 Jones Act, Pub.

It has high poverty and unemployment rates and low labor participation rates. Puerto Rico has been marred by public debt, political corruption, mismanagement, national disasters, and inadequate federal assistance. The U.S. entered the Great Recession in December 2007 and recovered by June 2009.6 In contrast, Puerto Rico’s recession began in 2006 but never fully ended.7 By 2016, the island’s $72 billion debt crisis led the federal government to establish The Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (Oversight Board), to manage the restructuring of Puerto Rico’s debt and fiscal planning.8 In September 2017, the island was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which wiped out the island’s electric grid, washed out roadways and bridges, and damaged buildings and residences.9 The damage to the power grid  5 Steven Carlson, Dorothy Rosenbaum, Brynne Keith-Jennings, & Catlin Nchako, SNAP Works for America’s Children, Ctr.

Many of the island’s residents need government assistance.

Although restricted access to federal benefits is not the root cause of economic disparity on the island, it has exacerbated the conditions of poverty and  16  Martínez v.

If Puerto Rico is granted the same access to federal funding and federal public benefit programs as states in the mainland are, there would be improved disaster planning, a quicker response for disaster relief, and an increase in economic assistance and work training resources that could bring Puerto Rican residents out of poverty. This paper examines the limited access Puerto Rico’s residents have to federal benefits such as SNAP, SSI, and Federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to determine how these limitations have exacerbated the high poverty rate in Puerto Rico and impacted post-Hurricane Maria relief efforts on the island. Part II briefly discusses the poverty statistics in Puerto Rico pre- and post- Hurricane Maria. Next, Part III identifies the differences between federal public benefits programs implemented in Puerto Rico and the contiguous U.S. Finally, Part IV analyzes how implementing SNAP, Federal EITC, or statehood would improve the economic recovery of the island.  I. POVERTY STATISTICS IN PUERTO RICO  Although it may seem that Hurricane Maria in September 2017 was the triggering event for Puerto Rico’s high poverty rates, the island’s struggles originated well before. Looking at data from 2007, the FNS Feasibility Study found that 56.2% of Puerto Rican households lived on incomes at or below 130% of the U.S. poverty guideline, compared to the 20.3% of mainland U.S. 5Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   households.21 Puerto Rico’s poverty rate in 2018 was 43.1%.22 In comparison, the U.S. national poverty rate in 2018 was 13.1%, with the poorest state, Mississippi, having the highest rate at 19.7%.23 Over two-fifths of all Puerto Rican residents lived in poverty in 2018.  Data shows 57% of the children in Puerto Rico lived in poverty.24 These high statistics are nothing new for the island.  To put these rates in better context, in 2016, the median household income in the U.S. was $57,617.25 By contrast, the median household income in Puerto Rico was only $20,078—half that of Mississippi, whose 2016 median household income was $41,754.26 When looking at the most recent data from 2019, Puerto Rico’s median household income stayed relatively equal at $20,474, but U.S.’s median household income has risen to $65,712; even Mississippi’s median increased to $45,792.27  This income disparity can be partly attributed to higher unemployment rates and lower labor participation rates in Puerto Rico than in the U.S. The labor force participation rate reflects the percentage of adults either working or looking  21 FNS Feasibility Study, supra note 3, at 8. 22 Glassman, supra note 14. 23 Id. 24 Brynne Keith-Jennings, Introduction to Puerto Rico’s Nutrition Assistance Program, Ctr.

In 2016, researchers noted that the size of the labor force declined more sharply than the size of the adult population on the island.37  The data showed that labor participation rates were not only substantially lower than in the U.S. across all ages, but that they also started dropping off at an earlier age.38 These trends can be attributed to three factors: a decline in birthrates, outmigration to the mainland U.S., and an aging population.39 These conditions contribute to a perpetual cycle of poverty on the island that only increases with every new emergency. A lack of jobs in the formal labor market, a shrinking workforce, and inadequate financial assistance from the government leaves Puerto Ricans unable to meet their immediate financial needs, let alone raise themselves out of poverty without government assistance. Financial independence is especially difficult when so many Puerto Ricans’ homes were damaged or destroyed during the hurricanes of 2017. Even if Puerto Rican residents have enough funds saved to scrape by and survive, the economic conditions, as well as the devastating effects of natural disasters on the island,  37 Bram & Wheeler, supra note 39. 38 Id. 39 Id. 8DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   hinder them from being able to comfortably care for their children and raise a family. The overall economic instability of the island is enough to push families to leave what little they have in Puerto Rico to live in the mainland U.S., where they then would have access to resources from the federal, state, and local governments, as well as from non-profits and community or church groups. Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island in the past decade40, including many families with children and young adults, leaving a greater percentage of the aging population on the island.41 Because those who remain have less children and continue to age out of participation in the work force, the labor force participation rate will continue to decline. Unless economic conditions on the island improve in a way that incentivizes young individuals to stay in Puerto Rico and allows them to raise families of their own, anyone who is able will continue to leave the island for better livelihoods elsewhere in the U.S. This will leave Puerto Rico with an ever-shrinking population of only the most economically disadvantaged.  II. PUERTO RICO’S ACCESS TO FEDERAL PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS   40 Matthew Martinez, Puerto Rico Lost Nearly 12% of Its Population in a Decade, Population Reference Bureau, (June 25, 2021) https://www.prb.org/articles/puerto-ricos-population-declined-by-12-percent-between-2010-and-2020-where-did-they-go/ (last visited Sept. 26, 2021). 41 Centro Center for Puerto Rican Studies, Enduring Disasters: Puerto Rico, Three Years After Hurricane Maria, (Sept. 2020). 9Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   As the District Court in Peña-Martínez stated, “[d]enying needy U.S. citizens equal access to the SSI, SNAP, and LIS safety nets simply because they reside in Puerto Rico is unconstitutional, [and] a breach of ‘our American ideal of fairness.’”42 Puerto Rico’s residents are given second-class citizenship by the federal government—they only have access to federal benefits and voting representation if they leave the island permanently for the U.S. mainland. Despite their U.S. citizenship, Puerto Rican residents have no voting representation in Congress to voice their opinions about how programs should be administered to their residents.43 Congress determines Puerto Rico’s eligibility for federal programs on a case-by-case basis and further determines whether the federal programs it grants to Puerto Rico are subject to additional funding or eligibility restrictions.44 This unequal access to government assistance inherently exacerbates the conditions of poverty on the island by incentivizing outmigration. The U.S. federal government never provides enough economic assistance to alleviate conditions of poverty on the island. Instead, it leaves assistance a stone’s throw away in Florida. For example, federal Medicaid funding in Puerto Rico is limited by law. Medicaid on the island serves fewer people, covers fewer services, and  42 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 163-4. 43 FNS Feasibility Study, supra note 3, at 7. 44 2014 GAO Report, supra note 6, at 7. 10DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   pays lower rates to providers than it does in the U.S.45 Puerto Rico’s residents are also ineligible for Medicare Part D LIS benefits, which subsidizes private insurers’ prescription drug plans for elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries.46 In contrast, a Puerto Rican in Florida would receive, among other forms of aid, expanded SSI benefits and LIS benefits. Expanded access to benefit programs creates a powerful incentive to leave the island and could partially explain why in 2018, one-third of outmigration from Puerto Rico to the U.S. was to Florida.47 This section will further examine the differences between administration of SSI, SNAP, and Federal EITC in the mainland U.S. and comparable programs in Puerto Rico. First, SSI provides additional cash income to those who are 65 and older, blind, disabled, or with incomes that fall below a certain level—as long as they live within the U.S., District of Columbia, or the Northern Mariana Islands.48 Puerto Rico residents are ineligible for SSI. Instead, the territory receives capped funding through a substitute program called Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD).49 AABD is less funded than SSI and must adjust by requiring higher income and resource thresholds in return for lower monthly benefits.50 As a result,  45 Keith-Jennings & Wolkomir, supra note 7, at 4. 46 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 167. 47 Glassman, supra note 12. 48 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 162. 49 Id. at 165. 50 Id. 11Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   many people who would be eligible for SSI in the U.S. are ineligible for AABD. Those who are eligible for AABD receive considerably less than they would on SSI.51 For comparison, during the 2011 fiscal year, the average AABD monthly payment was $73.85, while the average monthly SSI payment  was $438.05.52  If Puerto Rico had been a state in 2011, 305,000 to 354,000 eligible residents could have received SSI, thus expanding access to at least an additional 270,599 residents.53 In reality, only 34,401 individuals in Puerto Rico were enrolled in the AABD program in 2011.54 Next, SNAP (formerly the Food Stamps Program) helps people buy food if their income and assets fall below specified limits.55 SNAP operates as an entitlement program, allowing it to both serve all eligible people who apply and expand (or contract) its assistance to accommodate changing needs and food insecurities.56 Puerto Rico was originally eligible for food assistance through the Food Stamps Program until President Reagan’s Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 replaced it with a block grant funded program called the Nutrition Assistance Program (NAP).57 Just as with AABD, the limited funding to NAP has forced the program to set stricter eligibility thresholds and lower benefit levels to  51 Id. 52 Vaello-Madero, 956 F.3d at 29. 53 2014 GAO Report, supra note 6, at 82. 54 Id.  55 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 166. 56 Keith-Jennings & Wolkomir, supra note 7, at 1. 57 Id. at 2. 12DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   stay within its budget.58 It also means that unlike any resident of the mainland U.S., many eligible residents of Puerto Rico are denied benefits because NAP is not an entitlement program that expands to meet increased needs during economic recessions or natural disasters.59 In October 2017, Congress authorized roughly $1.27 billion in additional NAP funding, which Puerto Rico began using in March 2018.60 The additional funds allowed Puerto Rico to raise income limits and increase benefits, which modestly increased the number of NAP beneficiaries.61 Prior to the new funding, a family of three would only be entitled to NAP benefits if its monthly net income was below $599—leaving many families without aid.62 With the original block grant funding, that family could only receive a maximum monthly benefit of $315.63 By raising income levels with the additional funding, a family of three could be eligible for NAP benefits if its monthly net income was below $1,606, expanding the number of eligible families who receive NAP.64 That family of three could now receive a maximum monthly benefit of $511—nearly $200 more than under the block grant funding.65   58 Id.  59 Keith-Jennings, supra note 26, at 2. 60 Id. at 7. 61 Id. 62 Id. 63 Id. 64 Keith-Jennings, supra note 26, at 7. 65 Id. 13Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   After the additional funding ended in March 2019, NAP recipients’ benefits were cut to previous levels, but the island kept the higher eligibility levels.66 By June 2019, Congress approved another $600 million in supplemental funds for NAP; with these new levels, a household of three needed a monthly net income below $1,706 in order to receive a maximum monthly benefit of $315 and an additional supplement of $98.67 In addition, due to COVID-19, Congress approved two additional funding increases totaling roughly $297 million, which increased NAP participation from 1.3 million residents to 1.5 million and temporarily raised benefits.68 However, funding was depleted by October 2020, leading to average monthly benefit amounts falling from the supplemental COVID-19 relief levels by about 40 percent.69 The importance of NAP and food assistance cannot be overstated. In 2018, NAP helped over half of the island’s children — about 327,000 children — afford food.70 The same year, over 95% of households with children had a monthly income below the federal poverty line ($20,790 per year for a family of three).71 This means only five percent of families with children in Puerto Rico had a monthly income above the federal poverty line.

Finally, the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) was created in 1975, in part to offset the impact of Social Security payroll taxes on low-wage workers.74 EITC is a federal tax credit for low- and moderate- income workers that reduces personal income tax liability and allows low-income tax filers to retain more of their incomes.75 The amount of a recipient’s EITC depends on their income, marital status, and number of children.76 As the recipient earns income, they receive a corresponding tax credit, and if the EITC exceeds the worker’s income tax liability, they will receive the balance as a refund.77 Because a worker’s EITC grows as they earn each dollar of income, evidence has shown that the EITC incentivizes work and boosts incomes.78 As a result, U.S. presidents of  72 Id. 73 Keith-Jennings, supra note 26, at 7. 74 Rosanna Torres & Javier Balmaceda, Why the Federal Government Should Support Puerto Rico’s New EITC, Ctr.

In Puerto Rico, a single parent with two children can receive a maximum EITC benefit of $1,500, but the same family in the U.S. could receive $5,828 in federal EITC.85 Thus, even the federal government’s most successful anti-poverty measure, which incentivizes work and boosts labor  79 Torres & Balmaceda, supra note 74, at 1. 80 Fin.

III. HOW IMPLEMENTING FEDERAL PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS WOULD IMPACT PUERTO RICO  In Martínez, the plaintiffs and the federal agencies being sued moved for summary judgment on whether the exclusion of the plaintiffs from SSI, SNAP, and Medicare Part D LIS benefits, based on their residency in Puerto Rico, violated the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.86 The federal government offered three rationales for opposing Puerto Rico’s inclusion in federal public benefits programs: (1) the high cost of extending the programs to Puerto Rico; (2) the disruption the island’s economy would suffer from benefits being granted in Puerto Rico; and (3) Puerto Rican residents’ exemption from paying federal income tax.87 For the first proposed rationale, fully implementing many of the federal public benefits programs in Puerto Rico would be expensive, but the Court immediately rejected this argument as an inadequate justification in light of Vaello-Madero,88 which firmly held, “The cost alone does not support differentiating individuals.”89 This section  86 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 164. 87 Id. at 163. 88 Id. at 173. 89 Vaello-Madero, 956 F.3d 12, 29 (1st Cir. 2020) (emphasis in original). 17Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   will examine the various effects that implementing SSI, SNAP, or statehood may have on Puerto Rico, in light of the government’s two remaining rationales. Regarding the implementation of SSI, the federal government argued in Martinez that increasing welfare benefits to Puerto Rico—given the island’s already high poverty and unemployment rates—would disincentivize employment in the formal labor force and thus create a disruptive effect on the island’s economy.90 However, SSI benefits are only available to low-income individuals who are aged, blind, or disabled—a group that already has low participation rates in the work force.91 It seems unlikely that eligible SSI recipients alone could produce a noticeable disruption to the island’s economy when Puerto Rico has had both a high unemployment rate and low labor participation rate for years. Further, many SSI recipients are unable to work due to age or disability, and those who are looking for work have difficulties entering the formal labor market. The government’s contention that Puerto Rican residents should not receive SSI benefits because they do not pay federal income tax fails on the same logic. SSI is a means-tested program only for low-income individuals, meaning that recipients generally do not pay income taxes—even on the mainland—because they earn so little.92 Instead, the increase in federal fund transfers to the island would provide  90 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 173. 91 Id. at 173-74. 92 Id. at 175. 18DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   significant financial assistance to the poor and stimulate the local economy, since SSI recipients spend their received funds at local stores. SNAP, like SSI, is also a means-tested program.93 The same logic that applied to SNAP—many SNAP beneficiaries earn too little to pay federal income taxes—applies here, further undercutting the government’s resistance to implement SNAP in Puerto Rico.94 As SNAP is an entitlement program, even low-income individuals who do not pay federal income taxes are not excluded from receiving SNAP benefits.95 By contrast, the government’s economic disruption theory regarding SNAP seems more rational because a large number of SNAP recipients are made up of the working poor, who could be affected by labor disincentives. However, the increase in supplemental NAP funding after Hurricane Maria, which significantly raised monthly income eligibility levels and benefit amounts, casts doubt on this theory.96  The critical flaw in the government’s logic is that the SNAP program has work requirements and employment and training programs seeking to combat labor disincentives, while NAP does not.97 For example, SNAP’s limitation on adults (aged 18 to 50) without children from receiving more than three months of SNAP benefits in any 36-month period if they are not employed or in a work or  93 Id. at 177. 94 Id. 95 Martínez, 478 F.Supp.3d at 177-78. 96 Id. at 178. 97 Id. 19Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   training program for at least 20 hours a week is considered one of the harshest rules of SNAP.98 As a result, many recipients’ benefits are cut off after three months, irrespective of whether they are searching diligently for a job or willing to participate in a work or training program.99 In fact, many states have sought to appeal this rule because it is administratively complex, error prone, and undermines states’ efforts to design more meaningful work requirements.100 States can choose to request a waiver from the requirement, which a third of the states have elected to do over the last 20 years.101 Waivers are granted if states can provide detailed evidence of high unemployment in local areas, either through an insufficient number of jobs in a given geographic area or an unemployment rate of over 10%.102 Although Puerto Rico’s unemployment rate was below 10% as of October 2020103,  the economic disruption from the global pandemic makes it possible for the island’s unemployment rate to rise again; regardless, there is a lack of jobs in many areas of Puerto Rico that will likely make it eligible for a waiver. Even the Oversight Board's 2020 Fiscal Plan acknowledged that current welfare eligibility programs on the island may disincentivize some residents from  98 Ed Bolen & Stacy Dean, Waivers Add Key State Flexibility to SNAP’s Three-Month Time Limit, 1 Ctr.

The Puerto Rican government estimates the change will not have any positive effects until the end of a four-year implementation period and has not made any progress in implementing this requirement.108  In summary, the federal government’s argument that implementing SNAP in Puerto Rico would disrupt the local economy by disincentivizing labor fails to take into consideration Puerto Rico’s current economic state: ,its lack of jobs in the formal economy, low labor participation rates, and structural barriers to employment. SNAP can also implement work requirements and provide funding  104 2020 Fiscal Plan, supra note 83, at 79. 105 Id. 106 Id. 107 2020 Fiscal Plan, supra note 83, at 89. 108 Id. at 83. 21Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   for work and training programs that could help combat labor disincentives. Puerto Rico could then request waivers to give it time to generate an employment and training plan with the influx of federal funds. Furthermore, the waivers would only apply until Puerto Rico had enough jobs or a low enough unemployment rate, thus further limiting any labor disincentives.  Implementing SNAP in Puerto Rico would significantly improve natural disaster relief efforts. In a 2019 audit report, after Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of Agriculture  reviewed the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS)’s supplemental funding to NAP and found several deficiencies that could be improved by a transition to SNAP.109 If Puerto Rico had used SNAP prior to the hurricanes, the island could have requested and operated a Disaster SNAP (D-SNAP), intended to respond to the expanding need following a natural disaster, which would have provided a full month’s benefit allotment to households that may not normally have qualified for SNAP.110 Without D-SNAP, Puerto Rico must rely on Congress to pass disaster relief legislation that authorizes funding for additional benefits in the wake of a natural disaster.111 The FNS and Puerto Rico’s Administration of Socioeconomic Development of the Family (ADSEF) must complete the grant cooperative  109 Off. of Inspector General, U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Audit Report 27702-0001-22, Review of FNS’ Nutrition Assistance Program Disaster Funding to Puerto Rico as a Result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2019). 110 Id. at 2. 111 Id. at 6. 22DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   agreement and the internal control plan.112 ADSEF must then develop and submit a comprehensive plan for how to spend the additional funding, a communications plan, and a regional impact plan for approval—all while operating in disastrous conditions. 113 The OIG audit report found that because of this process, emergency nutrition assistance funding did not reach Puerto Rico until six months after Hurricane Maria.114 In comparison, the U.S. Virgin Islands utilized  D-SNAP and received aid 47 days after Hurricane Maria.115 Without authority under D-SNAP, Puerto Rico is unable to effectively plan how to distribute emergency funding prior to a natural disaster because it does not know when it will receive funding, how much funding will be granted, or what requirements will be tied to the funds.116 Implementing SNAP would grant Puerto Rico permanent statutory authority to operate D-SNAP, eliminate these planning and approval hurdles, and ultimately lead to faster aid in the wake of a natural disaster.  112 Off. of Inspector General, U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Audit Report 27702-0001-22,6 Review of FNS’ Nutrition Assistance Program Disaster Funding to Puerto Rico as a Result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2019). 113 Id. 114 Id. at 7. 115 Id.  116 Off. of Inspector General, U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Audit Report 27702-0001-22,5-6 Review of FNS’ Nutrition Assistance Program Disaster Funding to Puerto Rico as a Result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2019). (FNS and ADSEF had developed a comprehensive disaster plan prior to the 2017 Hurricanes, outlining how it would utilize emergency funding like D-SNAP, which provides a small amount of funding over a short timeframe. However, Congress approved a much larger amount of funding meant to be distributed over a 2-year period compared to what is granted under D-SNAP, requiring ADSEF to develop a new comprehensive plan accounting for these factors.) 23Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,    Quicker relief is not the only benefit to implementing SNAP in Puerto Rico. The OIG audit report also found that there is room to improve disaster nutrition assistance by improving coordination with other federal agencies performing disaster relief efforts on the island, like FEMA.117 Instead, FNS and ADSEF spent several months developing a comprehensive plan for administering the supplemental NAP funds after Hurricane Irma and Maria, leading to a six- to seven-month delay in setting up temporary application sites on the island for individuals seeking supplemental relief.118 Had SNAP been timely operating sites around the island, they could have been modified into joint application sites.119 Joint application sites would have streamlined the application process and prevented individuals from needing to travel to multiple sites throughout the island to apply for aid from each agency individually, especially when structural barriers, such as transportation delays and road closures, made traveling even more challenging.    A transition to SNAP would further strengthen FNS’s oversight of Puerto Rico’s eligibility system. The OIG audit report found that between March and September 2018, there were $1.4 million in overpayments of supplemental NAP funds, $1.5 million in underpayments, and $1.2 million in payments to deceased  117 Id. at 11-12. 118 Id. at 11. 119 Id. 24DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   recipients.120 This was partly due to a coding error in the eligibility system that overwrote data when caseworkers entered data in the retroactive claims module of the system, resulting in over or underpayments to some households.121 Puerto Rico was also not using data from the Social Security Administration (SSA)’s death information to remove deceased participants from its records.122 Instead, Puerto Rico used information from the Puerto Rico Department of Health Vital Records, which only had information on individuals who died between 2000 and 2015.123 Under SNAP, FNS requires state agencies to compare their records to SSA’s database.124 Thus, if Puerto Rico had operated SNAP, it would not only have planned for and received aid more quickly, but it also would have received better oversight from the federal government to eliminate administrative errors and increase better coordination with other federal agencies, allowing these agencies to pool resources and share data. All of these measures would create a more efficient system to aid Puerto Rico in its disaster relief efforts and provide enough funding to meet the needs of all of its eligible beneficiaries.  Implementing these two federal programs—SSI and SNAP—would provide meaningful relief to the poor in Puerto Rico, but the most comprehensive  120 Id. at 15. 121 Off. of Inspector General, U.S. Dep’t of Agriculture, Audit Report 27702-0001-22,16 Review of FNS’ Nutrition Assistance Program Disaster Funding to Puerto Rico as a Result of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (2019).  122 Id. at 17. 123 Id. at 17-18 124 Id. at 18. 25Ocasio: Puerto Rico's Second-Class StatehoodPublished by Via Sapientiae,   and long-term approach to economic stability on the island would be U.S. statehood. Statehood would not only incorporate both SSI125 and SNAP126, providing the essential benefits outlined above, but it would also provide access to the federal EITC.127 As a U.S. state, residents of Puerto Rico would file federal income taxes128 and thus have access to the federal government’s most effective anti-poverty measure: the federal EITC. Combining the federal EITC with Puerto Rico’s local EITC would lower the tax liability for the working poor on the island and encourage many to enter the formal labor economy129. This would provide a considerable labor incentive that could both help boost the low labor participation rate plaguing the island and counteract the disincentives created by the influx of federal funds from other federal programs. Additionally, elevating Puerto Rico’s status to full statehood would help strengthen the island’s economy by eliminating the risk from Puerto Rico’s uncertain political status and looming public debt.130 Providing full access to federal funding and oversight would help strengthen confidence in the island’s recovery and future, allowing for more commitments from businesses and investors. Most importantly, statehood would create voting  125 2014 GAO Report, supra note 6, at 82. 126 Id. at 78. 127 Id. at 29-30. 128 Id. at 32. 129 Torres & Balmaceda, supra note 72, at 2-3. 130 2014 GAO Report, supra note 6, at 30. 26DePaul Journal for Social Justice, Vol. 15, Iss. 1 [], Art. 6https://via.library.depaul.edu/jsj/vol15/iss1/6   representation in Congress for Puerto Rico131,  allowing it to generate political capital and ensure its voice is heard.  IV. CONCLUSION  Puerto Rico has a long history of complex, interlocking economic obstacles because of its status as a U.S. territory as opposed to a U.S. state. This status has hindered Puerto Rico’s relationship with the U.S. federal government. These challenges were further compounded by Hurricane Maria’s devastating impact in 2017. Any major solution to Puerto Rico’s high rate of poverty will take long-term and strategic planning from all levels of government and will likely include contributions from community organizations, non-profits, and the private sector. Access to key federal public benefits programs can help provide essential support to bring Puerto Rico out of poverty, but the greatest protection tool to ensure long-term recovery is statehood. The remedies proposed in this paper will be costly to implement, but money alone is not reason enough to reject these solutions. The residents of Puerto Rico are Americans, whether they live on the island or make up the Puerto Rican diaspora throughout the mainland U.S. They are vulnerable and amidst a crisis that is outside of their control. It is the responsibility of the U.S. government to find new ways to improve the lives of  131 Nicole Acevedo, What’s behind calls for Puerto Rico statehood?
