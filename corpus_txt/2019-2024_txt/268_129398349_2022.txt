Tourism development cannot be separated from the situation of changes and dynamics that occur at the National, Regional and International levels that influence each other.

The development of Indonesian tourism as a whole is the result of the work of various parties including the Government, the private sector, and the community. The national tourism 92 |  International Journal of Law Society Services   development policy is an effort to encourage actors in the tourism sector to achieve the goals outlined and the goals set.1   Tourism as a driver of the economic sector can be a solution for the government in increasing economic development. The tourism sector does not only touch certain economic groups but can reach the lower classes. Communities around tourist objects can establish various economic activities such as lodging, services, transportation, and so on. Tourism is a multi-complex system, with various aspects that are interrelated and influence each other. In the last few decades, tourism has become a source of driving community dynamics in sociocultural change.2 At least as a tourist village, it has adequate basic needs as a means to a tourist village, which involve various components, both Human Resources and Natural Resources in developing a tourist village.3 After the covid-19 pandemic, to restore the country's economic condition after the corona virus pandemic, the Indonesian government carried out policies related to handling covid 19, the new normal policies were implemented, including the restoration of economic conditions to bounce back. Sembiring4 All of this must be able to contribute knowledge and knowledge to the community. Among them are carried out by universities in the context of the Tridharma of Higher Education.5 Ketro Village is one of the villages in Sragen Regency, Central Java Province which has a natural beauty in the form of a reservoir name Ketro Reservoir which is one of the reservoirs that is the mainstay of the Bengawan Solo River. Unfortunately, this natural beauty has not been utilized optimally by both the community and the local government. Until now, the Ketro Reservoir has only used its water as a means of irrigating the surrounding community's rice fields during the dry season. Even the Ketro Reservoir area is often used by some irresponsible teenagers to do negative things such as binge drinking, dating, and other juvenile delinquency. It was stated that six teenagers and middle school students were caught in the middle of a drinking party in the Ketro Reservoir area. The main issue in the development of tourist villages is the positive contribution of tourism activities in tourist villages to the economic life of local communities.6                                            1  Sedarmayanti, Manajemen Sumber Daya Manusia, Penerbit PR.Refika Aditama, Bandung, 2005, page. 15 2   I Gede Pitana, Sosiologi Pariwisata, Andi Ofset, Yokyakarta, 2007, page. 35 3   Alip Sugianto, Kajian Potensi Desa Wisata Sebagai Peningkatan Ekonomi Masyarakat Desa Karang Patihan Kecamatan Balong Ponorogo, Jurnal Ekuilibrium, Vol. , No. 1, 2016 4   Sembiring, V.

The G20 meetings in Indonesia are a means of introducing tourism and Indonesia's superior products to the international community so they are expected to help drive the Indonesian economy. In terms of tourism, Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy Sandiaga Uno said the G20 event would contribute to the projected increase in foreign tourists of up to 1.8 million - 3.6 million and also 600 thousand - 700 thousand new jobs supported by good performance in the culinary, fashion, and tourism sectors. craft.7 The G20 is a multilateral cooperation forum consisting of 19 major countries and the European Union (EU) which have a middle to high-income class, from developing countries to developed countries. This scientific article, is hoped that it can be an innovation for the government and the community in developing local tourism in Sragen Regency, especially in Ketro Village in an integrated and systematic way based on community empowerment in the context of restoring and improving the people of Ketro Village in particular and Sragen Regency in general to welcome the G20 Presidency. The economy becomes a catalyst that has driving effectiveness in accelerating a country's economic growth. The election of Indonesia as the host for the G20 Presidency has become a strategic momentum for economic recovery for Indonesia. The series of activities of the G20 Presidency, which presents thousands of delegates from various G20 member countries, has the potential to benefit the Indonesian economy, both directly, especially in the tourism sector.8  With the potential of the homeland consisting of tens of thousands of islands and hundreds of variations of customs and culture, each of which has its uniqueness, then tourism will grow into a very profitable industry and have very bright prospects in the future for national development. In addition, tourism can provide employment and opportunities to try to grow culture and arts and for domestic tourists and tourism, it is useful to hone a sense of love for the homeland and improve national discipline. Tourism has become one of the largest industries in the world and is the mainstay in generating foreign exchange in various countries.9 One of the drivers of economic growth in Indonesia is the tourism sector, including local potentials such as tourist villages. Effective management of local tourism can accelerate development at the village level. As regulated in Law Number 6 of 2014 concerning Villages, which orders to encourage the acceleration of the development of human resources and infrastructure in villages to improve the quality of life and                                            7   G20 Pedia, g20.org  8   Kusmayadi dan Sugiarto, Metodologi Penelitian dalam bidang Kepariwisataan, PT Gramedia Pustaka Utama, Jakarta, 2010, page. 215 9   I Gede Pitana, Sosiologi Pariwisata, Andi Ofset, Yokyakarta, 2007 94 |  International Journal of Law Society Services   welfare of rural communities. In this case, of course, it is closely related to village management according to its potential to accelerate the development and increase income in the village area in a sustainable manner, which can be a catalyst for economic growth in general in Indonesia.10 As well as tourism potential in the form of Ketro Reservoir, which is one of the reservoirs on the Bengawan Solo River, this reservoir is precisely located in Ketro Village, Tanon District, Sragen Regency, Central Java Province. This potential can be used as a tourist destination that can improve the economy of the local community. Supported by the natural beauty of the Ketro Reservoir that is still awake (natural, clear, cool water, lots of green trees), its strategic location is easy to reach, and the area around the reservoir is wide. In addition to enjoying the beauty of the Ketro reservoir, it can be used as a tourist spot for water and fishing. The ketro reservoir embankment that has been smoothed and is protected on each side can be used as a relaxing area or jogging. Along the road under the reservoir embankment can be used by the community to sell food or crafts. If an area wants to develop the tourism sector, it is necessary for the participation of the local community so that tourism can bring benefits to the community.  B. RESEARCH METHODS This study was a normative empirical study that used data collection with a literature study. The activity was community service in the form of socialization, simulations, and discussions by the Community Service Team from the Sultan Agung Islamic University and Semarang State University in collaboration with experts from the Sragen Regency in central Java Province.  C. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 1.

Development is a process that moves in a straight line, namely from underdeveloped communities to developed countries.13 Development is a                                            10  Wrihatnolo dan Dwijiwinoto, Pembangunan Desa menyongsong Pembangunan Tinggal Landas Penerbit Pradnya Paramita, 2007. 11   Gardi Subandi, Pembangunan Berkelanjutan Pradnya Paramita, Jakarta, 2011 12   Rochajat Harun dkk, Komunikasi Politik, Yayasan Dian Desa, Jakarta, 2011, page. 36 13   Abdul Wahab, Managemen Pariwisata, CV Rajawali, Jakarta, 2004, International Journal of Law Society Services  95 |  process of planned social change because it includes various dimensions to seek progress in economic prosperity, modernization, nation-building, environmental insight and even improving the quality of human beings to improve their quality of life.14 Ketro Tourist Village is a community empowerment program that offers tourism village development innovations by utilizing local tourism potential in the area as a means of restoring economic growth catalysts.

The Ketro Tourist Village App carries various excellent features including Home, Ketolag Tourist Spot, Accessibility, and Lodging. Changes that occur in society can be categorized as changes that occur intentionally or planned. This means that one of the factors causing change is an external factor brought in and communicated through change agents from outside the community. The planned social change contained new ideas that are spread in the community (innovation), innovation will lead to change, both positive in the sense of bringing about better things (progress), as well as negative ones that can be detrimental. community members (regress).15 To support the running of the Ketro Tourist Village program, it is necessary to have cooperation between lines including: (1) The                                            14 Riant Nugroho dan Rochmin Dahuri, Selayang Pandang Pembangunan Wilayah Pesisir Penerbit Halimun Barka, 2014 15 Sentrisen Takome, Evie A.A.

Strategi Implementasi Ketro Tourist Village The tourism system is described through a closed system this model can be used to analyze the important components in providing attractiveness to a destination tour.16 The emergence of tourist villages in the tourism sector can provide new alternatives for tourists to carry out tourism activities. Tourist villages not only invite tourists to enjoy the beauty of nature but also learn and introduce the life of rural communities directly.17 Strategy in implementing 18 The Ketro Tourist Village program is carried out in four stages. The first stage is a preliminary study, in the form of a review of the Ketro Reservoir which will later implement the Ketro Tourist Village program and will collect data, availability, readiness, or ability and design a set of identifying opportunities to foster community in the program design. The second stage, the trial is the stage to test the implementation design of the Ketro Tourist Village program which is carried out through simulation activities to obtain the results of the program's feasibility analysis. The third stage, implementation is the field stage in the form of implementing the concept that has been made at the planning stage and has gone through the process of testing the program and application platform by the Ketro Tourist Village concept. The fourth stage is monitoring and evaluation in the form of monitoring and evaluating the success of the                                            16 Ninik Wahyuning Tyas, Maya Damayanti, Potensi Pengembangan Desa Kliwonan sebagai Desa Wisata Batik di Kabupaten Sragen, Journal of Regional and Rural Development Planning, Vol. 2, No. 1, February 2018. 17 Itah Masitah, Pengembangan Desa Wisata Oleh Pemerintah Desa Babakan Kecamatan Pangandaran Kabupaten Pangandaran, Dinamika Jurnal Ilmiah Ilmu Administrasi Negara, Vol. 6, No. 3, 2019 18 Ginanjar Kartasasmita, Strategi Penanggulangan Kemiskinan, Yayasan Dian Desa Akarta, 2014 International Journal of Law Society Services  97 |  program from the beginning to the end with the aim that the planned program runs according to and can show brilliant results. Local communities are also identical to traditional communities where traditional communities are people who are still bound by habits or customs that have been passed down from generation to generation. This attachment makes people easily suspicious of new things that require a rational attitude so that traditional people's attitudes are less critical.19 Facilities and infrastructure are needed to support Tourism Supporting Facilities (Supporting Tourism Superstructure), complementary facilities, and basic facilities that function not only to make tourists stay longer in a tourist destination but have other functions, namely, making tourists or visitors to tourist destinations more spend and spend their money on the tourist destinations they visit. Meanwhile, tourism infrastructure is natural resources and human resources that are needed by tourists in their journey to tourist destinations, which are included in this group, among others, electricity, water, telecommunications, terminals, bridges, and so on.20  D.
