Empirical studies in economic geography literature find that specialized regional economies are less resilient and hence, more susceptible to economic shocks. Thus, this capstone project highlights the need for the region to implement diversification policies to enhance its economy’s resilience to economic shocks. This capstone project conducted a panel study of 157 Canadian regional economies in 2006 and 2011 to determine if diversified regional economies were more economically resilient. Supporting the findings in economic geography literature, this study found that Canadian regional economies that were more diverse were more resilient. Base on economic geography literature, expert interviews, a jurisdictional scan, and policy analysis, this capstone project identified and recommended that the Fraser Valley Regional District implement several diversification policies.

Since the 2004 RGS, the Fraser Valley Region (FVR) has experienced socio-economic and demographic, which has prompted the FVRD to update its RGS to reflect these changes. In August of 2020, the FVRD released a draft copy of its updated RGS titled 'Fraser Valley Future 2050'. Both the 2004 and the 2020 draft RGSs emphasize growing and strengthening the region's specialized economy in agriculture. However, the 2004 and 2020 draft RGSs do not include policies explicitly aimed at diversification the FVR’s economy. Empirical studies in economic literature found that more diversified economies are more resilient to economic shocks; in contrast, specialized economies are less resilient and more susceptible to economic shocks. In this sense, diversification is seen as a portfolio strategy to mitigate the risks of external shocks. The FVR is in a crucial stage of development in which it is vital for the region’s future economic resilience that a RGS is developed that promotes economic diversification. If the FVRD's RGS does not include policies that aim to diversify the region's economy, the FVR will be less resilient and more susceptible to economic shocks, which can have detrimental socio-economic effects on the region, compared to regions with diversified economies.  Methodology and Results   This project employed three methods: a statistical model with a panel dataset, a jurisdictional scan, and expert interviews. First, a panel study was conducted to determine if economic structure (i.e., diversified or specialized), labour force educational attainment, and population size affected economic resilience of 157 Canadian regions from 2006 to 2011. The project found that Canadian regions with a more diverse economy, larger population size, higher proportion of labour force with post-secondary education were more economically resilient. The panel study’s results support this capstone project's central hypothesis and past findings from xiv empirical studies in economic geography literature that economic diversification enhances regional economic resilience.   Second, a jurisdictional scan was conducted to identify diversification policies that the FVRD could implement to diversify the FVR’s economy. The case study examines five selected jurisdictions' economic development plans. The selected jurisdictions are the City of Langley, Middlesex County, North West Oregon region, South Central Lower Michigan region, and Greater Eastern Oregon region. The case study identified many diversification policies. This capstone project categorized the identified policy options into six policy themes:  • marketing regions • supporting an entrepreneurial culture • targeting growth • developing financial supports • engaging in external events • developing an economic development committee  This study assessed diversification policies against selection criteria to identify the most optimal policies for the FVR. It identified three diversification policies, which are to develop an innovation hub, a staff-assisted directory for financial supports, and an economic diversification committee.   Third, expert interviews were conducted to identify social and governmental objectives for regional economic diversification. There were six interviewees in total. The interviewees were either government employees in an economic development department or scholars in economic development. The expert interview findings highlighted six social and governmental objectives: effectiveness, stakeholder acceptance, equity, efficiency, cost to government, and administrative complexity. The objectives were employed as evaluation criteria to assess the three diversification policies identified in the case study. Further, all interviewees highlighted the importance of economic diversification to enhance regions' economic resilience.  xv Policy Analysis and Recommendation   The goal of this capstone project is to recommend policy option(s) that increase the FVR's economic diversification to enhance the region's resilience to economic shocks. The policy analysis’s results found that based on the social and governmental objectives identified in the expert interviews that including a staff-assisted directory for financial assistance to the region’s website was the most optimal policy option for the FVRD. The policy analysis results also found that establishing an economic diversification committee was an optimal policy option for the FVRD. Further, the results found that creating an innovation hub was the least optimal policy option; however, it ranked the highest, amongst other policy options, for its effectiveness at increasing diversification in the FVR. Therefore, based on the policy analysis results, combined with evidence from economic geography literature, the jurisdictional scan results, and expert interview findings, this capstone project recommends that the FVRD implement all three policies. This project recommends that the FVRD establish a staff-assisted directory for financial supports and regional diversification committee immediately, and create an innovation hub in the long-term.     1 Chapter 1. Introduction   Since the 2008 recession, the concept of resilience has gained attention in economic geography literature (Martin and Sunely, 2015). Academics and policymakers alike have started examining how to make regions more resilient to economic shocks, such as recessions and idiosyncratic industrial perturbances (Boschma, 2016; Davies and Tonots, 2010). The general consensus in economic geography literature is that a more diversified economy is a more resilient one (Martin and Sunley, 2015; Davies and Tonts, 2010; Hassink, 2010; Frenken et al., 2007; Wolman et al., 2017; Brown and Greenbaum, 2017; Boschma, 2014; Tan et al., 2020). In contrast, specialized economies are less resilient and more suspectable to economic shocks (Martin and Sunley, 2015). In this sense, diversification is seen as a portfolio strategy to mitigate the risks of external shocks (Frenken et al., 2007; Kemeny and Storper, 2015). Local economies that are not resilient to economic shocks risk experiencing detrimental socio-economic effects (Davies and Tonts, 2010; Martin and Sunley, 2015), such as a diminished tax base, unemployment growth, increased poverty, and property value decline (Kitchens, 2010).   In response to the Local Government Act in British Columbia, Canada, that requires regions to develop a regional growth strategy (RGS), the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD) developed the 'Choices for our Future' RGS in 2004. Since the 2004 RGS, the FVR has experienced several changes such as economic growth and changing demographics, which has prompted the FVRD to update its RGS to reflect these changes. In August of 2020, the FVRD released a draft copy of its updated RGS titled 'Fraser Valley Future 2050.' The 2020 draft RGS provides socio-economic development goals for the region to strive towards over the next 30 years (FVRD, 2020a).   The Fraser Valley Region (FVR) has a specialized economy in agriculture. Although over the past couple decades the region's economy has grown to include manufacturing, aerospace, service, and high-tech areas, the growth is mainly connected to the region's agriculture industry, which forms a significant component of its economy. This is not to argue that agriculture is impeding the growth of other industries, but to highlight the specialization of 2 the FVR’s economy, which will impact the region’s economic resilience. For example, goods-producing industries that are linked to the agricultural industry play a large role in the FVR’s economy, with 30 percent of the region's labour force engaged in these industries (FVRD, 2020a). Furthermore, in 2015 the FVR had a gross farm receipt of approximately $1.5 billion, which was significantly higher than any other region in British Columbia. Specifically focusing on the agricultural industry, it produces $3.1 billion in annual economic activity. Moreover, most of the FVR's agricultural land is preserved and protected under the Agricultural Land Reserve, which prevents the re-zoning and development of designated agricultural land for alternative purposes (FVRD, 2017a). Nevertheless, the FVR’s economy is growing and therefore, is at a crucial stage for development in which the FVRD can implement diversification policies that build off the region’s economic growth. It is vital that the FVRD implement diversification policies that enhance the region's economic resilience and protect the region from future economic shocks. If the FVRD does not implement diversification policies now, the region’s economy will be more susceptible to future economic shocks and at a higher risk of experiencing detrimental socio-economic impacts to its economy.   The FVR's draft RGS for 2020 identifies economic resiliency as a goal; however, it does not explicitly state a diversification strategy to enhance its economic resilience. In the draft RGS, the concept of resilience is almost entirely left out, and the notion of economic diversification is not discussed. The core focus of the draft RGS is to build on its current economic strengths (FVRD, 2020a). If the FVRD's RGS does not include policies that aim to diversify the region's economy, the FVR will be less resilient and more susceptible to future economic shocks, which can have detrimental socio-economic effects on the region, compared to regions with diversified economies (Davies and Tonts, 2010). For instance, the FVR, which had a less diverse economy than the Greater Vancouver Region (GVR) before the 2008 recession, experienced a decrease in labour force participation of 1.7 percent, almost three times that of the GVR, which experienced a decrease of 0.6 percent, after the recession. During the same period, the FVR's employment rate decreased by 2.9 percent, approximately twice that of the GVR, which experienced a decrease of 1.5 percent (Statistics Canada, 2012). Although data is not readily available on the socio-economic effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the FVR, one could imagine that the pandemic has had a similar impact on the region's economy as the 2008 recession, since 3 the region still has a specialized economy (FVRD, 2020a). The pandemic has further highlighted the unpredictable nature of economic shocks and the urgency for the FVRD to diversify their economy to protect from future shocks. If the FVRD does not take steps to diversify its economy, the region will continue to experience similar adverse socio-economic effects as it did due to the 2008 recession.   The objective of this capstone project is to recommend feasible policy options to diversify the FVR's economic base and thereby, enhancing its resilience to economic shocks. The FVR is the focus of this project because the region has many opportunities for economic development, compared to other regions in British Columbia. This project examines the benefits and trade-offs of the identified policy options and discusses the potential barriers to their implementation. It conducts a literature review to assess and explain the current empirical findings and theoretical assumptions regarding diversification's effects on regions' economic resilience. Research for this project begins with a quantitative analysis using Statistic Canada census data for 2001, 2006, and 2011 to demonstrate the effect of diversification on Canadian regions' economic resilience. Then the project conducts a jurisdictional scan and expert interviews to identify and evaluate policy options.   4 Chapter 2. Literature Review: Economic Resilience and Diversity  2.1 Economic Resilience    Since the 2008 recession, regional economic resilience has gained mass attention by scholars and policymakers alike. The term resilience has been around for some time in psychology and ecology literature (Faggian et al., 2017; Hassink, 2010). Economists have applied the term to regional economics to examine regional economies' resilience to economic shocks (Martin and Sunley, 2015). In economic geography literature, there is conceptual ambiguity regarding the definition of resilience. Scholars from various sub-fields in economic geography use different definitions of resilience when conducting empirical studies. However, according to Martin and Sunley (2015), the notion of adaptive resilience is the most comprehensive and accurate definition. Adaptive resilience is an economy's ability to maintain its core function and performance despite the economic shock by reorienting and reorganizing its structure to an existing or new and more favourable growth path. Specifically, this notion of resilience as structural adaptability infers that resilient economies ‘bounce forward’ when hit by an economic shock (Faggian et al., 2017; Martin and Sunley, 2015; Martin, 2012).   Regional economic resilience refers to the ability of a region's economy to withstand or recover from an economic or environmental shock by either maintaining its developmental growth path or by adapting its economic structure to a different but more productive developmental growth path (Martin and Sunley, 2015). This definition incorporates adaptive resilience at the regional level. Furthermore, regional economic resilience is a process that has five components: vulnerability, shocks, resistance, robustness, and recoverability. First, vulnerability refers to the sensitivity of firms and the labour force to economic shocks. Second, shock refers to the origin, nature, scale, and the duration of the shock itself. Third, resistance refers to the initial impact of the shock. Fourth, robustness refers to the ability of firms, institutions, and the labour force to adapt and adjust to the shock. Fifth, recoverability refers to the extent and nature of recovery and the nature of the growth path after the region recovers. These five components are necessary to understand the resilience of regional economies. Moreover, as alluded to above, regional economic resilience is a recursive process in which the 5 structural change that occurs in a region's economy, in response to an economic shock, will determine its resilience to subsequent shocks (Martin and Sunley, 2015; Fingleton et al., 2012). In other words, "[regional] economic resilience … shapes and is shaped by the reaction of a region's economy to shocks" (Martin and Sunley, 2015, p.14).   When examining regional economies' resilience to economic shocks, it is essential to clarify what is meant by 'shocks' (Faggian et al., 2017). If shocks are equated to the 'slow-burning' pressures that occur incrementally over time (i.e., climate change), as some scholars have suggested (see Hassink, 2010), then the term gets diluted and indistinguishable from general economic change or 'industrial mutation' (Martin and Sunley, 2015; Schumpeter, 2010). Therefore, the term shocks need to be distinguished from the 'slow-burning' process to examine regional economies' resilience. To distinguish the term, Martin and Sunley define shocks as a sudden major economic impact, disruption, or interruption to a region's economy (Martin and Sunley, 2015). In essence, shocks are analogous to Schumpeter's gales of creative destruction in which outmoded and unproductive firms get swept away by sudden economic disruptions, creating room for new and more productive firms to emerge (Martin, 2012; Schumpeter, 2010). Building off Martin and Sunley's (2015) conceptual definition of shocks, this capstone project operationalizes the concept by defining shocks as two-quarters of consecutive decline in gross domestic product, such as the 2008 recession (Hubbard et al., 2018). Although this capstone project focuses on economic shocks, there are several other forms of shocks, such as industrial shocks or shocks caused by natural disasters and terrorist attacks (Wolman et al., 2017).  2.2 Economic Diversification and Resilience   Economic diversification in the context of regional economic development refers to the idea of diversifying regional economies' industrial structure. The technical definition of diversification is “[first,] the process of making things more unlike, different, and varied (a dynamic and positive concept), and [second,] the process of selecting assets to minimize risk (a dynamic and normative concept)” (Siegel et al., 1995, p. 262). Economic diversification gained attention during the Great Depression of the 1930s due to the adverse effects that economic downturn, specifically economic cyclical fluctuations, had on regional communities and 6 industries. Today, economic diversification is a primary element and focus of economic development departments (Dissart, 2003).   Regional economic development departments need to foster economic diversification to protect their regional economies from the adverse effects brought about by economic shocks or other perturbances, such as natural disasters and environmental disruptions. As previously mentioned, empirical evidence supports the claim that diversified regional economies are more resilient to economic shocks than specialized economies (Davies and Tonts, 2010; Frenken et al., 2007; Wolman et al., 2017; Hassink, 2010). The reason why diversification enhances regional economic resilience is attributed by scholars to the portfolio effect. The logic of the portfolio effect follows that of an investment portfolio in which the assets are the industries within a region. Employment is the return on investments, while employment variations are the risk. Therefore, the theory states that diversifying a regional economy acts as a risk-spreading strategy that will safeguard the region against losses due to economic shocks and fluctuations in the economy (Frenken et al., 2007; Dissart, 2003). In other words, the portfolio effect results in modularity in which subsystems (i.e., industries) within a system are weakly connected so that when a shock does occur, its adverse effects are contained and largely do not affect the system as a whole (Martin and Sunley, 2015).  2.3 Other Factors of Economic Resilience   Research has highlighted several factors, besides diversification, that enhance regions’ economic resilience to economic shocks. Specifically, research has highlighted five factors that also affect regions’ economic resilience: educational attainment of the labour force, population size, tech sector size, manufacturing sector size, public sector size (Wolman et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2012).   First, research has found that regions with a higher proportion of their labour force with educational attainment equal to or lower than a high school diploma are less resilient to economic shocks. Employers in all professions are more likely to layoff non-professional 7 workers, who typically have lower levels of education, when their region experiences an economic downturn (Wolman et al., 2017; Hill et al., 2012).   Second, empirical studies have found that population size is negatively associated with economic resilience, with regions that have smaller populations, compared to regions with larger populations, are more resilient (Wolman et al., 2017; Faggian et al., 2017). Dijkstra et al. (2015) suggest that larger populated regions are less resilient because they have “stronger connections to international markets” and therefore, when hit by an economic shock, such as the 2008 recession, are more volatile and fluctuate with international markets (p.948). Further, Faggian et al. (2017) indicate that medium-sized regions, compared to large regions, are more responsive to (i.e., more capable of reorienting their economic structure in response to) economic shocks.   Third, research has found that tech sector size is positively associated with economic resilience (Chapple and Lester, 2007; Wolman et al., 2017). Martin and Sunley (2015) state that tech sectors are “more innovative and adaptable, that is, they have greater dynamic capabilities so that they can better reconfigure, renew and recreate their resources and assets in response to adverse circumstances” (p.29). They suggest that tech sectors have a greater absorptive capacity than other sectors, which allows them to faster absorb and diffuse new innovations into the regional economy, raising its productivity and recovery from economic shocks. Further, tech sectors attract high-skilled human capital, which increases region’s entrepreneurialism and helps renew their economic base (Martin and Sunley, 2015).   Fourth, research has found that regions with a larger manufacturing sector size are less resilient to economic shocks. Manufacturing industries have a cyclical nature in which the manufacturing sector will employ more workers when demand rises and layoff more workers when demand drops, such as during an economic shock (Wolman et al., 2017).   Fifth, research has also found that public sector size is positively associated with economic resilience, indicated that regions with a larger public sector, such as healthcare and social assistance, are more resilient to economic shocks. Public services are maintained by governments even during economic shocks, which explains the non-cyclical nature of 8 employment in the public sector, even during economic downturn (Martin and Sunley, 2015; Wolman et al., 2017).  2.4 Strategies of Economic Diversification   Research has recommended a plethora of diversification policies for regions to implement to enhance their economic resilience. However, it is out of the scope of this capstone project to examine all potential policy options. Therefore, this section of the capstone project will highlight the four overarching themes. The first theme is financial assistance, such as tax incentives and financial assistance, which are designed to attract and retain businesses to the region by providing financial support (Wolman et al., 2017). The second theme is industry targeting and clustering, which occurs when regions target growth in specific industries through “marketing and promoting, tax incentives, workforce training, and infrastructure development or redevelopment” (Wolman et al., 2017, p.136). The logic behind targeting and cluster policy is that industries can be identified for which a region can develop a competitive advantage. The third theme is technical assistance, which is when regional departments provide information to private sector firms regarding available technologies, management techniques, business strategies, and business-related activities. The logic behind regions’ providing technical assistance is that small and even medium-sized firms may be disadvantaged to operate at their most productive potential due to market failures or information deficiencies. Therefore, technical assistance policies aim to assist private firms to be more competitive and productive. The fourth theme is entrepreneurial assistance programs that assist entrepreneurs by providing infrastructure, access to office supplies, business incubators and accelerators. The logic behind helping entrepreneurs and small businesses is that they increase and diversify regional economic activity (Wolman et al., 2017).  9 Chapter 3. Research Context  3.1 Fraser Valley Region   The Fraser Valley Region (FVR) is a developing region with a robust resource-based economy in agriculture. The region’s agricultural sector is a crucial component of its economy and “is one of the most intensely farmed areas in Canada” (FVRD, 2017a, p.4). Six municipalities and eight electoral areas make up the region (Figure 3.1). FVR is one of the fastest growing regions in British Columbia, which experienced a population increase of 90,000 from 2004 to 2019 (FVRD, 2020a, 2004). Currently, the region has a population of 320,000 that is projected to increase to 500,000 in 2051 (FVRD, 2020a). Furthermore, the socio-economic changes in FVR's neighboring region, Metro Vancouver, has and is also expected to continue impacting the FVR. For example, the FVR's recreational parks are facing overuse due to increased domestic tourism from Metro Vancouver. Also, FVR has experienced a high level of in-migration from the surrounding areas like Metro Vancouver, which affects the region's ability to maintain affordable housing while at the same time protecting agricultural lands. Although the FVR has been and is expected to continue to be, impacted, its relationship with Metro Vancouver has also provided the region with many opportunities, such as access to a larger labour market pool, rising tourism demand, and increased collaboration opportunities (FVRD, 2020a). The changing socio-economic demographics, such as increased population size and economic activity, in FVR and surrounding regions will provide many opportunities and challenges for the region over the next 30 years. Therefore, it is imperative for the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD) to implement effective public policies to address these changes in order to foster a healthy and prosperous regional economy.  10  Figure 3.1 Map of Fraser Valley Regional District Source: https://www.fvrd.ca/EN/main/about-the-fvrd/what-is-the-fvrd.html  3.2 Fraser Valley’s Economic Structure   The FVR has a robust resource-based economy specializing in agriculture and is one of Canada's most heavily farmed regions. The FVR has the largest farm receipts in British Columbia of approximately $1.5 billion, which is $500 million more than Metro Vancouver and $250 million more than the rest of the regions in the province combined. Put differently, the FVR produces 39 percent of British Columbia's total farm receipts. From 2010 to 2015, the FVR was responsible for 44 percent of the total increase in the province's farm receipts. Furthermore, the total farm expense in the FVR was approximately $1.2 billion, of which the majority flowed back into the region's economy (FVRD, 2017a). Next to construction, the primary industries, such as agriculture, forestry, and fishing, combined with retail trade and manufacturing, comprise the largest proportion of business enterprises in the FVR at 27 percent. Compared to 11 Metro Vancouver, the FVR has approximately five times the labour force in its primary industries in the goods-producing sector (FVRD, 2010).   Over the past couple of decades, the region has diversified into other industries such as manufacturing, aerospace, and high-tech fields (see Figure 3.2; FVRD, 2020a). The FVR's expanding industrial structure is comprised of related economic activities surrounding agriculture like technology and manufacturing. The diversification that has occurred in the FVR is unevenly dispersed, being primarily isolated to Abbotsford's and Chilliwack's economy, while the rest of the municipalities and electoral areas' economies in the region have remained specialized in agriculture. Although the FVR's economy has diversified, the region's economy remains primarily specialized in and heavily dependent on agriculture (FVRD, 2017a). As illustrated in Figure 3.2, the labour force in the agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting industry has shrunk by 0.2 percent from 2001 to 2016. However, this trend is in part a reflection of the technological advancements, such as precision farming systems, drones, and bioscience, that has increase labour productivity on farms dramatically, resulting in fewer farmers being needed for agrarian work as in previous decades (Watson, 1947; Government of Canada, 2019a). The FVR has also experienced a decrease in labour force activity in its manufacturing industry. The manufacturing industry is closely related to the agricultural industry, through the food and beverage processing industry, which consumes over half of Canada's agricultural output (FVRD, 2017a). Further, the FVR has experienced a significant increase in the construction industry's labor force activity due to the increasing housing demand required to house the region's growing population (FVRD, 2011). Besides the primary industries (agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting), construction, and manufacturing, the FVR's structure has remained relatively constant over the past 15 years.  12  Figure 3.2 Change in Labour Force by Occupation, Fraser Valley Region, 2001 and 2016 Source: CHASS Data Centre http://datacentre.chass.utoronto.ca.proxy.lib.sfu.ca/census/  3.3 Fraser Valley’s Economic Resilience to the 2008 Recession   This capstone project conducted a preliminary examination using the 2001, 2006, and 2011 Statistics Canada census data to assess the Fraser Valley Region’s (FVR) economic resilience to the 2008 recession (see Table 3.2). Specifically, this project examined the socio-economic trends to assess the region’s resilience. From the preliminary examination, it is clear that the FVR was not immune to the 2008 recession. The FVR’s unemployment rate increased by 2 percent from 2006 to 2011, while the labour force participation rate decreased by 1.7 percent during the same period. In comparison, the Greater Vancouver Region (GVR) experienced an increase in its unemployment rate by 1.5 percent from 2006 to 2011 and a decrease in its labour participation rate by 0.6 percent during the same time frame. Further, the FVR experienced stunted employment growth from 2006 to 2011 of only 4 percent compared to employment growth in 2001 to 2006 of 16 percent; while the GVR did not experience such a severe stunt in 0.000.020.040.060.080.100.120.14Percent of Total Labour Force2001 201613 its employment growth during the same period. Comparing the FVR’s labour trends to the GVR’s trends, highlights the adverse impact that the recession had on the FVR’s economy.  Table 3.1 Comparing Socio-economic Trends in the Fraser Valley Region to the Greater Vancouver Region and Canada, 2001, 2006, and 2011  Fraser Valley Region Greater Vancouver Region Canada Unemployment rate percentage change 2006-2011 2% 1.5% 1.2% Labour force participation rate percentage change 2006-2011 -1.7% -0.6% -0.8% Employment 2001 108,205 995,320 14,695,135 2006 125,720 1,104,760 16,021,180 2011 130,135 1,182,395 16,595,030 Employment percent change 2001-2006 16% 11% 9% 2006-2011 4% 7% 4% Shift in employment (SI): Fraser Valley Region, Greater Vancouver Region relative to Canada 2001-2006 (SI2006) 1.07 1.02 ------ 2006-2011 (SI2011) 0.99 1.03 ------ Diversification (t-1) 2006 (SW2001) 2.71 2.76 2.75 2011 (SW2006) 2.71 2.76 2.77 Education (proportion of the labour force 25-64 with a post-secondary education) 2006 52% 66% 61% 2011 55% 69% 64% Population 2001 237,550 1,986,965 30,007,094 2006 257,031 2,116,581 31,612,897 2011 271,655 2,280,695 32,852,320 Population percentage change  2001-2006 8.2% 6.5% 5.4% 2006-2011 5.6% 7.8% 3.9% Source: Statistics Canada data  Based on the 2001, 2006, and 2011 Statistics Canada census data, the Shannon-Weaver index (SW), which measures industrial diversification, and the sensitivity index (SI), which calculated economic resilience, were calculated for both regions. Higher scores on the indices indicate more diversified and resilient economies. The FVR had a less diverse economy than the 14 GVR, as indicated by their SW scores respectively, 2.71 and 2.76 (see Table 3.2). Also, the FVR was less resilient to the 2008 recession than the GVR, as indicated by their SI scores for 2011 respectively, 0.99 and 1.03. The FVR had a less diversified economy prior to the recession, compared to GVR, and the FVR was subsequently less resilient to the recession as well. The FVR’s low resilience compared to the GVR can help explain why the FVR was more adversely impacted by the recession than the GVR. Further, Table 3.2 compares population change and labour force educational attainment in the FVR and GVR in 2006 and 2011.  3.4 Fraser Valley’s Regional Growth Strategy   The Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD) is currently updating its regional growth strategy (RGS) to reflect the socio-economic changes that have occurred in the region since 2004 (FVRD, 2020a). The 2020 draft RGS states eights goals:  • encourage collaborations between stakeholders and jurisdictions, • increase resiliency and build on economic strengths to realize the region's economic potential, • ensure all residents are able to maintain a high quality of life, • foster community development that complements urban and rural areas, • sustain the health of ecosystems, • develop an integrated, safe, and efficient transportation system that minimizes its impact on air quality, • provide efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective infrastructure and services to sustain growth, and • reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing energy efficiency.  The region's 2020 draft RGS presents two guiding principles to achieve these goals. The two guiding principles are collaboration and a balanced approach. Collaboration with stakeholders and governments is needed to achieve these goals. A balanced approach is needed in which all regional initiatives are interconnected, not independent irrespective of other initiatives (FVRD, 2020a). 15  Although one of the goals of the FVRD's 2020 draft RGS is to increase resiliency, it does not state what is meant by resilience or what it aims to make the FVR resilient from. The 2020 draft RGS does not mention resilience past using it as a header or highlighting it as a goal (FVRD, 2020a). The conceptual ambiguity of and, even more importantly, the lack of content on resilience indicates that resiliency is not a legitimate priority of the FVRD's RGS. Furthermore, the 2020 draft RGS, like the former 2004 RGS, does not provide a diversification strategy (FVRD, 2020a, 2004). There are several policies stated in the 2020 draft RGS to increase economic growth in industries, such as agri-tourism, but these policies do not explicitly aim to diversify the region's economy even though they could be employed to do so. To develop a more resilient economy, the FVRD needs to include a diversification strategy in its RGS that aims to broaden the region's industrial base. If the regional district does not include a diversification strategy, it will be less resilient to economic shocks compared to other regions and continue to experience more adverse effects when hit by an economic shock than surround regions, such as the GVR.   16 Chapter 4. Methodology  4.1 Multivariate Regression Modeling   This capstone project conducted a quantitative analysis using panel data from the Canadian Socio-Economic Information Management System (CANISM). This empirical analysis aims to testify the relationship between economic diversity and resilience, as discussed in economic geography literature, in the Canadian context. In so doing, the quantitative analysis corroborates its central assertion that the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD) needs to implement diversification policies to make the Fraser Valley Region (FVR) more economically resilient. The analysis covers 157 Canadian regions (n=314) with a population over 24,000 from 2006 to 2011 to determine the effect of diversification and other variables on the regions’ economic resilience. The project collected data to generate the key variables listed in Table 4.1. The independent variables examined were highlighted in the literature to affect regions’ economic resilience.  17 Table 4.1 Model Variables Variables Description Resilience (DV) The sensitivity index is used to measure resilience. It measures the shift in employment from the pre- to the post-recessionary period (2006 to 2011) for both a region and the nation. Then the index divides the region's employment shift by the nation's employment shift. Employment sectors are categorized by the two-digit-level NAICS. Diversification (IV) The Shannon-Weaver index is used to measure the diversity of regions' industrial base. The index measures the diversity of a region's industrial base by examining employment distribution among its industries as categorized by the two-digit-level NAICS. Year (IV) Dummy variable to indicate census year; the reference year is 2006.  Region (IV) Canadian census divisions with a population greater than 24,000. Education (IV) Proportion of regions' population from 25 to 64 with a completed certificate, diploma, or degree from a post-secondary educational institution. Population (IV) Total population in a region, 15 years and older by labour force activity. Tech Sector (IV) Total labour force, 15 years and older, in the professional, scientific, and technical industry as categorized by the two-digit-level NAICS.  Public Sector (IV) Total labour force, 15 years and older, in the public administration industry as categorized by the two-digit-level NAICS.  Manufacturing Sector (IV) Total labour force, 15 years and older, in the manufacturing industry as categorized by the two-digit-level NAICS.   DV = Dependent Variable; IV = Independent Variable; NAICS = North America Industrial Classification System   Resilience in this capstone project focused on regions' economic resilience to economic shocks. This project uses the adaptive resilience interpretation, as stated above, to define economic resilience. Adaptive resilience interprets economic resilience as a region's ability to change its structure to maintain its core functions, which is measured by the shift, or the lack of, in employment. This project used the SI to measure resilience. The SI measures the shift in employment from the pre- to the post-recessionary period for both a region and the nation. Then the SI divides the region's employment shift by the nation's employment shift. In other words, this index compares the shift in employment in each region compared to the shift in employment in the nation over a specified period to examine the sensitivity of a region to an economic shock. SI scores, based on the two-digit-level North America Industrial Classification System (NAICS), had a rough range of 0 to 1.2 with higher SI scores indicating higher regional resilience. The author took the natural logarithm of the SI for the multivariate regression. The SI was calculated for 2006 and 2011 using Statistics Canada census data (Formula 1), where Er,t is regional 18 employment at time t, En,t is national employment at time t, time t in the analysis is 2011 and t-1 is 2006.     (Formula 1)   Diversification in this capstone project examines the diversity of regions' industrial base. For the variable, diversification, this project used the SW to measure the diversity of regions' industrial base. The SW measures the diversity of a region's industrial base by examining employment distribution among its industries. The NAICS at the two-digit-level was used to examine the distribution in employment pre- and post-recession from Statistics Canada's labour survey. This project examines regional diversification for 2006 and 2011 by calculating the regions' diversification in the previous Statistics Canada census, 2001 and 2006 respectively, due to the time lag that diversification has on regions' resilience (Formula 2). SW scores, based on the two-digit-level NAICS, ranged from 0 to 3 with higher SW scores indicating higher regional diversification. For the SW, pi is the proportion of employment of the ith industry.  SW = 𝑐∑ −𝑝𝑖 ∗ log⁡( 𝑝𝑖)𝑛1   (Formula 2)   This capstone project used Statistics Canada's census data to measure education by calculating the proportion of regions' population from 25 to 64 with a completed certificate, diploma, or degree from a post-secondary educational institution. This project calculated education for each region from 2006 to 2011. It gathered data on regions’ population size from Statistics Canada census data for 2006 to 2011, which indicated the total population 15 years and older by labour force activity. Further, this project gathered data on the tech sector, manufacturing sector, and public sector from Statistics Canada’s census data for 2006 to 2011 as categorized by the two-digit-level NAICS. The tech sector refers to the total labour force in the professional, scientific, and technical industries. The manufacturing sector refers to the total labour force in the manufacturing industry. The public sector refers to the total labour force in the public administration industry.  19  The unit of analysis is Census Divisions with 24,000 inhabitants or more in Canada (n=314). This project examines regions at the census divisions level, which are provincially legislated areas as intermediate geographic areas between municipalities and provinces, as defined by Statistics Canada (2018). For the sample period, the historical datasets provided three censuses from Statistics Canada, ranging from the 2001 to 2011 census. This sample period is used to examine how diversification and other factors affect Canadian regions economic resilience.   This capstone project conducted a multivariate regression using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method to examine the relationship between the independent variables specified above on the dependent variable, resilience, over time. The OLS method is used to minimize the sum squared residuals (Wooldridge, 2013).   The author used software R to run the specified OLS model. Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used to evaluate the model goodness of fit. Next, the project conducted a backward stepwise regression to evaluate the goodness of fit. The backward stepwise regression is an approach that starts with a full model and eliminates variables one by one until the regression has produced a reduced model that achieves the best model goodness of fit, i.e. the lowest AIC (for more on backward stepwise regression, see Draper and Smith, 1998). The backward stepwise regression found that the independent variable, public sector, which was not statistically significant, raised the AIC, and therefore, were removed from the model.   Model diagnostics was performed to make sure that the model satisfy the classical linear model (CLM) assumptions. The CLM assumptions are as follows: the relationship between the dependent and independent variables are linear, the independent variables are uncorrelated with the error terms, the model is non-multicollinear, the observations are independent, and the residuals are normally and constantly distributed (Wooldridge, 2013). The author removed the independent variables manufacturing sector and tech sector to satisfy the non-multicollinearity assumption. Also, the author reported robust standard errors to account for heteroscedasticity. Further, the model was transformed to satisfy the remaining CLM assumptions. Specifically, the natural logarithm of the dependent variable, resilience, and the independent variable, population, 20 were used to satisfy all the CLM assumptions. The final OLS model included the following independent variables: diversification, education, population, and year (2006 and 2011).  The OLS equation is specified as follows:  log(resiliencei) = α0 + β1 diversificationi + β2 educationi + β3 log(populationi) + εi,  Where i is the observation; β is the coefficient for that independent variable; α is the intercept; and ε is the idiosyncratic error.  4.2 Jurisdictional Scan  The author initially reviewed economic development plans (EDPs) that focused on diversification from thirty-nine different jurisdictions throughout North America, Ireland, Austria, New Zealand, and Sweden (See Appendix A for the full list). Criteria to select jurisdictions with the most relatable and applicable EDP for the FVR include: availability of wealth of information on the EDP, jurisdictions being at the regional level, jurisdictions having a democratic political structure similar to Canada, and jurisdictions having an agricultural economic base. Filtering the thirty-nine jurisdictions' EDP through the criteria resulted in only four satisfying all the criteria: the Middlesex County in Ontario, North West Oregon, South Central Lower Michigan, and Greater Eastern Oregon.   The criterion of a jurisdiction being at the regional level was relaxed to include the City of Langley (Langley) in the case study. This criterion was the least essential criterion to satisfy because municipal diversification policies can be applied at the regional level. A similar political structure, an agricultural economic base, and a wealth of information were essential to examine potential policy options that the FVR could incorporate. Therefore, including the City's municipal diversification policies will not diminish these policies' ability to enhance regional economic diversification. However, Langley's diversification policies will be limited to a scope of municipal policies and will not examine regional coordination strategies. Once the criterion of being at the regional level was relaxed, Langley was the only jurisdiction out of the remaining 21 thirty-five jurisdictions to satisfy the selection criteria. Therefore, this project will examine the EDPs of Langley, Middlesex Region, North West Oregon, South Central Lower Michigan, and Greater Eastern Oregon (see Appendix A for table summary of selection process).  4.3 Expert Interviews   Interviews were conducted with academic and professional experts to develop the selection and evaluation criteria used to analyze the identified diversification policies from the jurisdictional scan. Six participants were interviewed, specifically three academics and three professional regional and city planners, who all had expertise in diversification economic policy and/or policy implementation. Each interviewee was asked the same six questions and regional planners were asked an addition three questions (see Appendix B). The additional question for regional planners attempted to understand the current actions taken towards regional diversification by their department. The interviews ranged from thirty to sixty minutes long. Once all the interviews were conducted, the author analyzed the data. Specifically, the author thematically analyzed the interview data, indexing the data for common, relevant, and important themes.  22 Chapter 5. Multivariate Regression Results   This capstone project conducted a quantitative analysis to examine the effect of diversification and other independent variables on regional economic resilience in Canada from 2006 to 2011. The purpose of the analysis was twofold; first, to examine the general hypothesis in the literature regarding the positive association between diversification and economic resilience and second, to support this capstone project’s central assertion that if the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD) implements diversification policies, the Fraser Valley Region’s (FVR) economy will be more resilient to future economic shocks. Table 5.1 gives some descriptive statistics, which were calculated for all 314 observations.

The overall mean of resilience was 0.992, indicating that the average Canadian region was less resilient than Canada to the 2008 recession. The Canadian region that was the most economically resilient region was Moulins, Quebec, in 2006 and Montcalm, Quebec, in 2011. Similarly, the diversification of Canadian regions did not vary strongly from 2006 to 2011. The region with the most diversified industrial base was Division No. 6 in Alberta at 2.80 in 2006 and 2.79 in 2011. Diversification was also positively associated with resilience, as indicated by its weak correlation of 0.171. The educational attainment of the labour force was positively associated with resilience, as indicated by its weak correlation of 0.260. The variable education did not vary strongly, with an overall standard deviation of 0.067. The region with the most educated labour force was the Ottawa division, with over 70 percent of its labour force aged 25 to 64 with post-secondary education in 2006 and 2011.   Further, the population mean of Canadian regions varied strongly from 2006 to 2011. The overall population mean was 135000 with a standard
