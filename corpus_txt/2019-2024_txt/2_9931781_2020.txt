Their economic impacts, however, have seen only limited research. Research has been limited by the lack of data and empirical evidence, due to the rarity of large-scale pandemics.  For this reason, the estimates about the economic impacts of pandemics that have been made have had to use a lot of assumptions and guesses. The subject of economic resilience to pandemics is largely untouched in past research, and parts of this thesis focus on that. It is an interesting concept that deserves further attention.  The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a coronavirus strain called SARS-CoV-2, has put the previous models and estimates to a test. The scale and speed of its economic impacts have been unprecedented and partly unexpected, with government spending and unemployment rising rapidly in  many countries. The purpose of this thesis is to give the reader a background about both past pandemics and past research into the economic impacts of pandemics. Knowledge about past events and literature helps to understand both realised and potential economic impacts of the current pandemic. This thesis can also be used as a starting point for future research.  Different policies to stop the spread of the pandemic are reviewed from multiple perspectives, utilising previous and current research. There seems to be an optimal policy when considering economic, social and health impacts. Quick reaction with heavy restrictions on mobility combined with extensive testing seems to minimise the impacts in all three mentioned categories. Such actions aim to suppress the virus, minimising the length of the pandemic. With suppression as the policy, the overall resilience of a system is maximised, while risk to an individual is minimised.

In the majority of developed countries, they are the third most common cause of deaths, after cancer and heart diseases. Despite developments in pharmaceuticals, rates of infectious disease are increasing due to urbanisation, increased travel, new diseases, irresponsible use of antibiotics and changes in human behaviour. (Verikios et al. 2011) Pandemics have occurred throughout the history of mankind, and they have had profound social impacts, sometimes altering history (Bell & Lewis 2004). Research into their economic impact, however, has been limited until recent. As there has not been a severe global pandemic in a century, empirical data is very limited and outdated. This has resulted in models and estimates which appear to be very inaccurate in today’s context. With the introduction of a new global pandemic in the winter of 2019-2020, the economic impact has become a relevant topic which deserves attention.  The current pandemic, a coronavirus causing a disease called COVID-19, has had the largest economic impact any pandemic or epidemic has had in the modern history. Previous estimates have used too optimistic assumptions, and the researchers have not fully understood how wide-spread consequences a pandemic outbreak can have. The length of the current pandemic remains to be seen, as well as the length of economic consequences caused by it. Most of the past research about the economic impacts of pandemics has claimed that economic impacts are largely short-term, except for the reduction in labour force caused by mortality. I suspect the current pandemic will cause at least medium-term effects, especially with the current way of handling the outbreak.  The purpose of this thesis is to provide a starting point for research into the economic effects of pandemics in general as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper includes a large number of sources covering different fields.  Historical pandemics and their economic effects are reviewed. This thesis also includes many studies about the economic effects of a potential pandemic, providing an overview of their results. Resilience and vulnerability, both important concepts in understanding the economic 7 effects of pandemics, are also explored. The impact of different policies when facing the current pandemic are also examined. The next chapter of this thesis introduces the definition of epidemics and pandemics and goes through historical pandemics. Past studies of economic impacts of pandemics are used as source material. Third chapter focuses on the research into potential economic impacts of pandemics. I included several different studies and articles from the last two decades in an effort to build understanding about past research and obtained estimates. Focus in the third chapter is on the results, mathematical models included in the studies are not presented.  If the reader is interested in the models or the theory behind them, more information can be found in the cited articles which are publicly available online.  Chapter 4 is about the concept of resilience to pandemics. Resilience and vulnerability are defined, and I introduce them in the context of pandemics. This is a very little researched subject, and I try to build the idea of resilience to pandemics based on literature about disaster and regional resilience. Chapter 5 gives an overview of the current coronavirus pandemic, focusing on the economic aspects. The impact on resilience of different policies is discussed. As the situation is new and evolving at the time of writing this thesis, majority of the sources are news articles and publications by authorities. Chapter 6 concludes this thesis. Findings and their policy implications are discussed, and some potential future research ideas are presented.   8 2 CASE EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS 2.1 About epidemics and pandemics In order to talk about epidemics and pandemics throughout this paper, I need first to define their meaning. As the focus in this thesis is in economics, going too deep into medical terms is not necessary. I am simply adopting definitions used by Bloom and Canning in their paper Epidemics and Economics, which are originally from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They give the following definition for an epidemic:  “The occurrence in a community or region of cases of an illness, specific health-related behaviour, or other health-related events clearly in excess of normal expectancy. The community or region and the period in which the cases occur are specified precisely. The number of cases indicating the presence of an epidemic varies according to the agent, size, and type of population exposed; previous experience or lack of exposure to the disease; and time and place of occurrence…Generally, a disease that exhibits large inter-annual variability can be considered as epidemic. (World Health Organization)” According to this definition, an epidemic is an unusually large amount of some health-related event occurring in a region. In this thesis epidemic refers always to some disease. Next, I give the definition for a pandemic used in the same source:  Pandemic: “An epidemic occurring over a very wide area (several countries or continents) and usually affecting a large proportion of the population. (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)” A pandemic is simply an epidemic that occurs over a large geographical area, inflicting a substantial proportion if the population.  (Bloom & Canning 2006) Diseases, epidemics and pandemics have impacted humans always, and over 10 pandemics have been identified in the past 300 years (Jonung & Roeger 2006). Same diseases that circulate the world today can be seen in human remains from ancient Egypt. There are numerous documented epidemics and pandemics since ancient times, and these might have contributed even to the rise and fall of empires. For example, in the conquest of America by Europeans diseases had a huge role, as the American 9 population lacked immunity against European diseases. It is estimated that the population of Mexico declined from 28 million to 1,6 million in the century after the Spanish invasion due to repeated outbreaks of diseases.  (Bell & Lewis 2004)  As pandemics cause such death in societies, they must have had significant social and economic consequences. The next part focuses on four past pandemics and their economic effects. Three of them happened in the modern era, and their economic consequences are particularly interesting. 2.2 Case diseases and their economic impacts 2.2.1 The Black Death  The most well-known historical pandemic, at least in the Western world, is the Black Death. It swept through Europe between 1347 and 1351, killing 25-35% of the population. It was caused by a bubonic plague spread by fleas living in rats and other rodents. Even in the medieval period Europe had a dense and active network of trade routes linking different areas of the continent, allowing the plague to spread rapidly. The plague devastated Europe: worst hit cities lost more than 3/4 of their population. (Bell & Lewis 2004) It is easy to deduce that an event of this magnitude would have huge economic consequences to the regions it impacted. In a society that relied heavily on agriculture the price of land had been expensive, and the plague caused land prices to fall and the marginal cost of agricultural production to reduce. This combined with a significantly lower population lead to more plentiful food supplies. Labour shortages also provided more employment opportunities to those who survived. (Bell & Lewis 2004) There has been some research into the economic effects of the Black Death, confirming the rise in real wages and a decrease in land rents. However, the return on capital declined. The direct long-term effect of the plague on Europe’s production level was negligible. This could be partly explained by the recurring outbreaks of plague and wars, especially the Hundred Years War fought between France and England. (Bell & Lewis 2004) 10 2.2.2 The influenza pandemic of 1918 The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, also often called the Spanish Flu, killed at least 40 million people worldwide from the spring of 1918 to the late spring of 1919. An estimated 25-30% of the world’s population were infected, and up to 11% of the infected died. Even though it killed at least twice as many as the partly concurrent First World War, there has been very little research into its economic impact. In 2002, none of the leading textbooks of economic history mentioned the epidemic. (Brainerd & Siegler 2003) Perhaps the lack of research and literature regarding the Spanish Flu is explained by the First World War, which is thoroughly reviewed in the literature, including its economic impacts. The research that does exist focuses on the health effects and mortality differences between socioeconomic classes. (Garrett 2007) Even though the pandemic was widely called the Spanish Flu, its origins remain unclear: suggested origins include Midwestern United States and China (Kilbourne 2006). The virus swept across the globe in three waves, the wave in the fall of 1918 being the deadliest (Bell & Lewis 2004). The global troop movements during the war and the demobilisation after it contributed greatly to the spread of the virus in a world where movement of people was usually on a much lower level (Garrett 2007). Even strictest quarantines did little in preventing the spread of the epidemic (Brainerd & Siegler 2003).  Of all the pandemics in the last 300 years, the 1918 pandemic seems to be the most severe, and it was easily the most severe in the 20th century (Arnold et al. 2005). Typical influenzas are usually dangerous for the very young and old, being less severe for healthy adults. The influenza of 1918 was unique in this regard: it was unusually deadly for population aged 18 to 40, and especially for men. The vulnerability of men is sometimes linked to the higher prevalence of latent tuberculosis, which can lead to more severe symptoms (Bell & Lewis 2004). One source from the United States reports that from a total of 272 500 male influenza deaths in 1918, 49% were 20-39 years old. (Garrett 2007)  Usually the age profile of mortality rates in influenzas is U-shaped, as the disease is deadliest for young children and the old. Most deaths in a typical influenza are caused 11 by a secondary bacterial infection leading to pneumonia (Arnold et al. 2005).  In the influenza of 1918, the shape represented the letter W, as people in prime working age were affected unusually heavily (Brainerd & Siegler 2003). In this age group death was not usually caused by a pneumonia, but by a immunological overreaction to the virus, causing the individuals with the strongest immune systems to perish (Garrett 2007). Young and healthy individuals often died in less than 48 hours (Arnold et al. 2005). Even though the economic effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic are little researched, it is clear that it was a large shock that had substantial macroeconomic effects (Brainerd & Siegler 2003). As the influenza killed a disproportionate amount of working age men, it reduced the labour supply and had a significant economic impact on businesses and families. The effect was amplified as the First World War had already killed a large amount of the same demographical group, especially in Europe. (Garrett 2007)  Brainerd and Siegler found that the epidemic in the United States was positively correlated with the following economic growth. They included the states for which data was available and concluded that a 0,1% increase in the death rate led to a 0,2% increase in the annual rate of economic growth for the next decade. However, they also found that business failure-rate was unusually high in 1919 and 1920, possibly due to deaths and economic effects of the pandemic. This means that the growth after the influenza is at least partly just a return to the trend. (Brainerd & Siegler 2003) There is also the possibility that the First World War had caused economic stress and limited investments during the war, and the ending of the war could have also caused a significant boost to the economic growth.  Most of the easily quantifiable microeconomic effects of the influenza were short-term. Businesses in the service and entertainment industry suffered double-digit revenue losses, but at the same time companies specialised in health care products and equipment experienced a period of growth. Some research suggests that a shortage of labour increased wages, at least for some time. (Garrett 2007) 12 Based on the available research, the overall economic effects of the influenza pandemic of 1918 seem to be relatively small. Economic data from the period of the pandemic is often either missing or distorted due to the First World War, which makes research difficult and inaccurate.  Even though it had a massive scale and the influenza killed a disproportionate amount of working-age people, in the years after the pandemic there is very little evidence about negative impacts on economy.  2.2.3 The SARS epidemic of 2003 SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, was the first deadly epidemic of the 21st century. After an initial outbreak in Guangdong, China, in November 2002, it quickly spread to at least 28 countries. The total number of cases reached 8 437 by July 2003, when the epidemic ended, and caused the death of 813 individuals. Regions that suffered the most were China and Hong Kong, with 348 and 298 deaths respectively.  (Lee & Mckibbin 2004) SARS was a new strain of coronavirus, it spread through droplets and caused pneumonia which could be fatal (Siu & Wong 2004). The case fatality rate was about 10%, and the emergence of the virus caused a lot of fear about a potential pandemic (Lee & Mckibbin 2004). Even though the virus was eventually contained, and the total number of killed was very low on global scale, SARS had significant economic impacts especially on the impacted areas (Bell & Lewis 2004).  The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a travel advisory urging people not to travel to Guangdong or Hong Kong on April 2, 2003. This devastated travel and tourism industries in the affected regions. In Hong Kong, the number of airline passengers fell by 77%, land travel dropped by 52% and travellers coming by sea declined by 72%. The occupancy rate in hotels dropped from 79% in early March to 18% in early May. (Siu & Wong 2004)  Even though SARS was a minor disease on global scale, it had large but short-term economic consequences. Some estimates put the cost of the virus at over 11 billion dollars. The economic consequences were caused by the strict measures taken to contain the epidemic and the uncertainty revolving around the epidemic. Modern and 13 global media coverage also helped to spread the fear and uncertainty (Bloom & Canning 2006). Fear of getting infected altered behaviour in the affected regions, reducing consumer demand (Lee & Mckibbin 2004). In Hong Kong the largest negative effects were on the demand side. As the residents were afraid of catching the virus, they started to avoid social interaction. Local consumption and export of services suffered heavy losses, the sales of restaurants and retail outlets dropped by 10-50%. Reduced demand and domestic consumption led to an increase in both unemployment and underemployment. (Siu & Wong 2004)  The stock market reaction to SARS was moderate. Between March 12th and April 30th, the Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong dropped by 1,78%. During the same period other indices continued to rise, except for the Taiwan Weighted Index and Japan’s Nikkei 225. The SARS epidemic had no supply-side effects in Hong Kong, as the regions manufacturing base in the Pearl River Delta was unaffected and global supply chains were unaffected. There was also no negative impact on domestic or foreign investment. (Siu & Wong 2004) The negative economic effects turned out to be short-lived, as the spread of the epidemic was successfully stopped. Tourism resumed, unemployment levels become lower and fear and panic subsided. The stock market quickly rebounded as the WHO declared the epidemic was over. (Siu & Wong 2004) The SARS epidemic also caused governments of the impacted regions to act. Hong Kong launched a one-time relief package of 1,5 billion dollars to help companies survive the shock. Singapore offered 132 million dollars in relief to help affected businesses. Taiwan authorised 1,4 billion dollars to cover business losses and medical costs and ordered nearly a million people to quarantine in May. (Bell & Lewis 2004) This was the first epidemic in the era of globalisation and modern markets, and it gave valuable insight about how pandemics could impact the economy. The economic consequences from a global disease are not limited only to the affected industries in the affected regions. As international trade and finance links have increased with 14 globalisation, an economic shock to one country is quickly spread to other countries (Lee & Mckibbin 2004).  SARS is an important case in understanding the economic effects of an epidemic. It clearly demonstrated that the economic effects are not limited only to the costs of lost lives and healthcare, which were both low in the case of SARS. Most of the economic losses are caused by psychological factors; fear and uncertainty reduce demand and expectations about the future are re-evaluated. The SARS epidemic also set a precedent for government involvement in both controlling an epidemic and mitigating economic losses caused by it.  2.2.4 The H1N1 pandemic of 2009 In May 2009, a new strain of H1N1 influenza emerged in Mexico. It is commonly known as the swine flu, as it is closely related to a pig influenza. It was highly infectious and spread to all six continents in five weeks. The virus spread more rapidly than expected, and WHO declared a pandemic on June 11, 2009. The virus spread to more than 200 countries, inflecting hundreds of millions of people. (Verikios et al. 2011) WHO confirmed over 18 000 fatalities by June 2010, but the amount of unconfirmed deaths may be significantly higher (Verikios et al. 2011). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that the worldwide death toll for the first year of the pandemic ranged from 151 700 to 575 400. The virus affected primarily children and adults, with 80 percent of those who were killed by the disease under 65 years old. (Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention 2019) The H1N1 virus proved to be a relatively mild strain of influenza, and efficient public health measures helped to stop the pandemic (Verikios et al. 2011). One study found the death rate to be just 0,026% (BBC 2009). Perhaps due to efficient public health measure and the low fatality rate of the virus, its economic effects are studied very little. One paper estimated the excess hospital admission costs in England totalled 45,3 million pounds between June 2009 and March 2011. Another research estimated that in Chile the pandemic lead to a loss of 16 million US dollars due to labour productivity 15 loss caused by missed days of work. Extrapolating the results to the United States, they estimated the cost of lost labour productivity there to be 2 billion US dollars. A 2013 paper estimated that due to the virus Mexico lost almost one million visitors, resulting in losses of around 2,8 billion US dollars to the tourism sector (Delivorias & Scholz 2020) These historical epidemics and pandemics give some information about what kind of economic consequences a pandemic can have. Labour supply is decreased in long-term due to mortality, and in short-term due to illness. Health related costs increase during a pandemic. More recent cases, SARS and H1N1, clearly demonstrate the impact on tourism, travel, and the hospitality industry. SARS also showed how significant role psychological factors play, reducing demand and even impacting financial markets.   16 3 THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL PANDEMIC  3.1 Past studies and estimates Numerous studies and reports have tried to quantify and predict the economic impacts of a possible pandemic outbreak. The methods and results vary a lot, depending on the expected characteristics of a new virus and the economic factors considered. Older papers, written before the SARS epidemic, tend to put a focus on the lost workdays due to illness and deaths. Newer studies generally try to include the effects of reduced economic activity and psychological factors. Some studies even consider the value of lost human lives (Fan et al. 2018).  The research however has been highly speculative, as there has not been a significant pandemic in a hundred years, and the world has changed a lot since then. Without empirical data and knowledge, researchers have had to use rough estimates for many factors. The models are sensitive to the estimated infection rate and mortality, used values have been mostly guesses about the true numbers of past epidemics.  A study conducted in 2005 by the United States Congressional Budget Office considered two separate pandemic scenarios and their effects in the United States. First scenario resembles the 1918 influenza pandemic, with 90 million people getting the disease and 2 million of them dying, with a 2,5% case fatality rate. In the second and milder scenario 75 million people are infected and 100 000 of them die, case fatality rate being around 0,1%. (Arnold et al. 2005) The scenarios included declines in short-term demand and supply, shrinking of labour supply, and a drop in the long-term supply. A lot of assumptions were made. In short-term, a surge in demand for health services was assumed. International travel was expected decline dramatically, but not completely. Nonessential activities requiring social interaction were expected to decrease significantly, including cultural events and going to restaurants. During a severe pandemic the health system would be overwhelmed, and health care workers would suffer disproportionately leading to further strain on health care. (Arnold et al. 2005) 17 Business confidence would falter, supply chains would be affected, and the stock market would fall for the period of the outbreak. The actions of governments would both mitigate and increase the negative effects. Enforced travel restrictions and quarantines would increase the economic impacts, but they would reduce the human toll and give time to develop a vaccine. (Arnold et al. 2005) The authors give rough estimates for both demand and supply-side effects in both scenarios, reminding the reader that the estimates give the cost of a potential pandemic, and not what a society would be willing to pay to prevent a pandemic and numerous deaths. In the severe scenario, the negative demand-side effects would be around 2% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and supply-side effects 2,25%, giving a total GDP reduction of 4,25% in the year of the pandemic. The mild scenario would yield much smaller economic consequences, indistinguishable from normal economic volatility. The negative impact to both demand and supply would be 0,5% of the GDP, for a total reduction of 1%. This means that the GDP would likely continue to grow in the year of the mild pandemic. (Arnold et al. 2005) Long-term impact of a pandemic would be the reduction in labour force caused by excess mortality. This would depend greatly on the mortality rate and which age group the disease affects the most. If a large proportion of those who are killed are of working age, the economic impacts are magnified. Pandemic that affects mostly older people would not have such a large impact on the total labour force. (Arnold et al. 2005) In the study the authors admit that due to the lack of empirical evidence and estimates, calculating the effects of a pandemic is extremely hard. A clear lack in the study is that the authors do not consider potential unemployment caused by a pandemic. They also do not assess the possibility of increased business failures. The assumed declines in demand are also quite small, especially in the mild scenario. In the mild scenario, air transport is expected to decline by 17% and accommodation by 20%. Demand for other services declines by 1%. Finance sector is unaffected in both scenarios, even though the authors think the stock market would temporarily fall during a pandemic. (Arnold et al. 2005) 18 European Commission published a similar study in 2006, estimating the potential macroeconomic consequences of a pandemic in Europe. They concluded that even though a pandemic would cause a lot of suffering, the macroeconomic impacts would likely not be severe. Three important factors used in the modelling are the morbidity rate (infection rate), number of work weeks lost and mortality rate. In their calculations using a New Keynesian macro-economic model, they adopt the severe scenario from the previously mentioned study conducted by the United States Congressional Budget Office. (Jonung & Roeger 2006) The pandemic is assumed to last only one quarter, with morbidity rate being 30% and mortality rate 2,5%. Number of weeks off work due to the pandemic is estimated to be 3 weeks. In the base model, the effect of reduced demand causes a 0,5% drop to the GDP growth in the year when the pandemic occurs. The negative supply-side effect is 1,1%. In total, the GDP growth is expected to slow down by 1,6%. Mediterranean countries would be hit the hardest, due to their large tourism sector. (Jonung & Roeger 2006) The authors did also study additional scenarios. When the role of psychological factors, causing a larger reduction in demand, were increased, the GDP loss increased to 3,3%. Share prices falling by 10% would increase the loss by an additional 0,2-0,8%. If the pandemic would last two quarters instead of just one, the GDP would be reduced by 2,6%. Adding only these additional reductions together, the GDP growth of EU would drop by 6,1-6,7% in the year of the pandemic. There would also be additional losses if the pandemic happened during summer, when the tourism sector is the most active. The authors conclude that even a pandemic that would cause higher mortality than the influenza pandemic of 1918 would not spell disaster for the economy of Europe. The estimated impact is roughly the same as of a major recession. (Jonung & Roeger 2006) In a 2006 paper by McKibbin and Sidarenko, four different scenarios are considered: mild, moderate, severe and ultra. Each scenario includes shocks to the labour force caused by deaths and illnesses, supply shocks, demand shocks and risk premium shocks. The authors give the decrease in the global GDP only for mild and ultra scenarios, and they do not give assumptions about the severity of each scenario in an 19 easy-to-read form. The global GDP decrease is estimated to range from 0,8% in the mild scenario to 12,6% in the ultra scenario. They assume the economy of North America and Europe would not be impacted as much, and equity markets would fall, but only a little. (Mckibbin et al. 2006) A short paper by Burns et al. published in 2008 considered a pandemic similar to the 1918 pandemic. They assumed air travel, tourism, restaurant sales and consumption of public transport services would decline by 20%. Total mortality of population varies between regions, from 0,3% in the United States to over 2% in certain developing countries. In their model, the total impact to global GDP would be -3,1%. This includes reductions from mortality (-0,4%), illness and absenteeism from work (-0,9%) and efforts to avoid infection (-1,9%). The authors remark the assumptions about decline in demand are low compared to declines witnessed during the SARS epidemic, and actual number could be very different. (Burns et al. 2008)  Verikios et al., in a 2011 paper, also considered two separate pandemic scenarios: a virus with a low infection rate (3%) but a high case fatality rate (10%), and a virus with a high infection rate (40%) but a low case fatality rate (0,5%). These numbers represent a situation where there is no treatment or restrictions on movement. Their main findings were that a virus with a high infection rate, but a low case fatality rate, would have larger economic consequences. The effects would be amplified in regions that are more globally integrated. (Verikios et al. 2011) In modelling, the authors used a modified version of GTAP suitable for dynamic events. GTAP is a multi-regional, comparative-static, computable general equilibrium model. It includes world trade and investment, representing markets as perfectly competitive and traded goods as imperfectly substitutable. In simulating the economic effects of a pandemic, they included four different shocks: 1) An increase in demand for hospital and other medical services. 2) Temporary reduction in the labour force, due to sick leaves and school closures requiring parents to stay home.  3) Permanent reduction in the labour force caused by deaths. 20 4) Temporary reduction in international tourism and business travel. (Verikios et al. 2011) In the scenario with a high case fatality but a low infection rate, effect on the global GDP in the year the pandemic occurs is -0,27%. When looking at quarterly numbers, the effects are highest in the second quarter of the epidemic: GDP is -0,3% below baseline and employment -0,32% below baseline. Global economy starts to recover in the fourth quarter following the initial outbreak, and the recovery takes a year. (Verikios et al. 2011) In the scenario with a low case fatality but a high infection rate, effect on the global GDP in the year the pandemic occurs is -3,34%. When looking at quarterly numbers, the effects are again highest in the second quarter of the epidemic. GDP is -4,5% below baseline and employment -6,4% below baseline. Global economy starts to recover in the fourth quarter following the initial outbreak, and the recovery takes a year. The global GDP and employment stay above baseline for several years following the recovery. (Verikios et al. 2011) The results obtained by the authors additionally demonstrate that economies are affected not only by how the pandemic situation evolves within their own country, but also by how other areas and global trade are affected. As a result, economies relying heavily on tourism and international trade will be more heavily affected by a potential epidemic. (Verikios et al. 2011) The World Bank estimates that a global influenza pandemic similar to the 1918 pandemic could cost the global economy 3 trillion US dollars, which is 4,8% of the GDP. Even a less severe, moderate influenza pandemic would cost 2,2% of the global GDP. Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability of different countries to pandemics. The International Monetary Fund’s threshold for a major economic disaster is a loss of 0,5% in the GDP. (Global Preparedness Monitoring Board 2019) 21  Figure 1. Economic vulnerability of countries to pandemics in terms of GDP loss (Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, 2019.

Trying to quantify or model the economic impact has been very difficult, as there are no benchmarking events in recent history. Uncertainty about the biological characteristics of a potential pandemic, including length, infection rate and case fatality rate obviously impact estimates a lot. The number of different factors included in the estimates is also important.  Most of the estimates include the temporary and permanent reductions in the labour supply caused by a pandemic. Permanent reduction is naturally caused by deaths and depends to some degree on the demographic group the pandemic affects the most. Temporary reduction in most studies is defined by those who are ill and those who are forced to stay at home. Of course, there is also the chance that healthy individuals cannot work due to restrictions on movement or businesses, and this is largely unexplored in the studies I have examined. Potential unemployment caused by a pandemic is also largely unaccounted for. 22 Pandemics have obvious impacts to the demand and supply, but the expected reductions vary greatly between studies. Most agree that service industry and travel industry are the most affected, due to fear and travel restrictions. I found most of the estimated reductions in different industries to be very optimistic, and the numbers were not based on empirical evidence, except for tourism and air travel in the newer studies.  Psychological effects were included in some of the studies and including them generally gave much higher estimates. Fear and expectations alter the behaviour of both individuals and businesses, and even a mild epidemic can reduce demand a lot. Uncertainty, especially in the early stages of a pandemic, can also reduce risky behaviour of all market participants. It is possible that investments are reassessed and share prices become volatile as the future becomes uncertain. The potential impact of uncertainty in the financial markets was also largely neglected in these studies.  Analysing the potential economic impacts of a pandemic is and will be difficult, as pandemics are a rare event. Each one is also unique, they have different qualities, spread around the world with a different pace and have very different economic impacts. Creating an accurate and general model for estimating the economic impacts of pandemics is therefore likely impossible. It is more important to understand the different ways a pandemic can impact the economy.  Table 1 summarises the estimates. Most of the estimated impacts to GDP are quite small, ranging from almost zero to around -5%. Only the ultra scenario in the paper by McKibbin and Sidarenko gives a figure that is higher than 5%.              23 Table 1.

It refers to the ability to recover from a disturbance or disruption. The concept of resilience has been used for some time in numerous scientific fields, such as ecological sciences and engineering. (Martin 2012) First to use the term were ecologists in the 1970s, when it was defined as “the ability of systems to absorb changes … and still persist”. Since then the use of the term has spread to many scientific fields, including economics. Research of resilience to short-term disasters started in the 1990s, and limited study into the economic effects of disasters in the 2000s. (Rose 2009) The term resilience still lacks a uniform definition, maybe because it is applied in several different fields and situations. There are many different definitions for resilience from different fields, but I will mention only two relevant ones. It must be noted that I could not find a written definition for resilience to pandemics or epidemics.  From the literature of disaster resilience, the following definition of resilience mentioned by Cutter et al. (2008) can be used in the context of pandemics:  “a community or region’s capability to prepare for, respond to, and recover from significant disturbance-driven changes: while maintaining community character, cohesion and capacity, and without permanent impairment of the community’s public safety and health, economic, social, and national security functions, thus, accelerating recovery.” This definition is clearly related to the resilience of a community, and it only briefly mentions the economic aspects of resilience. But maintaining economic and social functions during a pandemic is obviously important for the resilience of any region or country.  25 Hill et al. (2008) define regional economic resilience as “the ability of a region to recover successfully from shocks to its economy that either throw it off its growth path or have the potential to throw it off its growth path but do not actually do so”. Regions can be thrown off their growth path by either a structural change or an external shock. Negative shocks can cause three different responses in a region. If the economy of a region is not impacted by a shock, it is called shock resistant. Regions that rebound quickly are called economically resilient. Those regions that are unable to return their previous growth path are non-resilient. (Hill et al. 2008) Economic resilience can also be divided into static and dynamic resilience. Static economic resilience is the inherent ability of a system to maintain economic functions when shocked. It is existing prior to the shock and includes for example inventories and emergency plans. Dynamic economic resilience is the recovery speed of a system from a severe shock. This adaptive form of resilience refers to the adaptation to new situation caused by a negative shock.  (Rose 2009) Martin, in his 2012 paper, explores the concept of regional economic resilience from multiple perspectives and tries to develop the idea further. He introduces three different interpretations of regional economic resilience, these are engineering resilience, ecological resilience and adaptive resilience. Martin also gives us four different dimensions of regional resilience, these are resistance, recovery, re-orientation and renewal. I will focus on these interpretations and dimensions in the following chapters. (Martin 2012) 4.1.1 Engineering resilience Engineering resilience has its root in physical sciences. It focuses on the resistance of a system; this refers to the ability to withstand and recover from shocks. A more shock-resistant system has a smaller initial reaction to a shock and recovers from it faster and is therefore more resilient. In the context of regional resilience, a resilient region rebounds faster to its original growth path following the shock. A region with low resilience is impacted more by the initial shock, and the recovery takes longer. (Martin 2012) 26 The focus of the engineering interpretation is on the stability of a system or a region near its equilibrium. The economy is assumed to be self-equilibrating: shocks that move the economy away from its equilibrium activate automatic compensating adjustments, which operate until the economy is back in the equilibrium. The time of recovery may vary, based on how quickly the adjustments start to affect, but the economy will return to the pre-shock equilibrium. This is illustrated in figure 2. (Martin 2012)  Figure 2. Impact of a shock on a region’s growth path. Adapted from Martin (2012). 4.1.2 Ecological resilience Ecological resilience focuses on the elasticity threshold of a system. Each system has a certain amount of disturbances or shocks it can absorb before these events push the system beyond its elasticity threshold. When the threshold is reached, the system changes form, function or position. Resilience is measured by the amount of disturbances a system can withstand before reaching the elasticity threshold. (Martin 2012) In the context of regional economic resilience, reaching the elasticity threshold can have two different results. The resulting change can have a positive impact on the 27 region’s economy, leading to a state that is better than the pre-change state. Such a region has high resilience. If the impact is negative, and the following state is inferior to the pre-change state, the region has low resilience. (Martin 2012) This leads us to the concept of hysteresis. Romer (2001) defines it as an event “where one-time disturbances permanently affect the path of the economy”.  For example, a recession can permanently change the industrial structure of a region, and the new growth path will be different. Destruction of businesses and increased unemployment might cause a permanent contraction to a region’s economy. Such a region has low resilience. There may also be positive effects caused by a shock, and the new growth path will be higher than before the shock. A recession may destroy old and ineffective structures, companies and policies, leading to beneficial reforms and new innovative businesses. A region that moves to a higher growth-path following a shock or disturbance has high resilience. (Martin 2012) 4.1.3 Adaptive resilience The roots of this interpretation are in the theory of adaptive systems. An adaptive system has a capacity to rearrange its internal structure spontaneously when facing an external shock or internal issues. In the context of regional resilience, a resilient region has the capacity to reconfigure its structure when facing external or internal shocks or disruptions. A resilient region can maintain a good growth path, with for example high rates of entrepreneurship and firm formation, innovativeness, willingness to move beyond current sector and the diversity of economic structure. (Martin 2012) This interpretation views resilience as a dynamic progress, which is always evolving. A region with has high level of adaptive resilience continuously replaces outdated and unproductive activities and businesses with new structures, companies and innovations. An external shock, such as a recession, accelerates this progress. The impacts of a recession, both negative and positive, are different for different regions and for example the pre-existing industrial structure has an effect. A region where the positive adaptation effects outweigh the negative shock effects is resilient. (Martin 2012) 28 4.1.4 The dimensions of regional resilience Martin suggests that there are at least four different dimensions of regional resilience, which are all interconnected. First of these dimensions is resistance, which refers to a region’s vulnerability and sensitivity to disturbances and disruptions. These include for example recessionary shocks. Recovery is about the speed and extent a region recovers from a shock. The third dimension concerns the extent of structural re-orientation of a region, and how the associated changes impact the region’s economy. The fourth dimension, renewal, concerns the degree of a regions’ resumption to the pre-shock growth path. (Martin 2012) 4.1.5 The role of industrial structure The industrial structure plays a large role in the resilience of a region. The more diversified the industrial structure is, the better a region’s resistance to shocks is. The analogy is largely the same as for a diversified investment portfolio – the risk of an industry-specific shock becomes smaller when the number of industries goes up. The industries should not be closely linked to each other, or in investing terms their correlation when facing certain shocks should be low. Specialising in only one industry is risky for a region in the same way investing in only one company is. There are however positive externalities associated with specialisation, so the solution for the optimal industrial structure is likely not just maximised diversity. (Simonen et al. 2020) Specialising in one industry does not automatically lead to regional economic problems when facing a negative shock. If the shock hits only some specific industry, the probability that it hits the specific industry a region is specialised in is low. A shock that impacts the whole economy nullifies the benefits of a diversified industrial structure. Some industries also are naturally more resilient than others, limiting the risk of specialisation. Martin also claims in his 2016 paper that the overall importance of economic structure is limited. The specific competitive qualities of a region play a larger role in how regions react to and recover from economic shocks. (Martin et al. 2016) 29 4.2 Regional economic resilience and pandemics The theories and concepts of regional economic resilience can also be used when considering resilience against pandemics. Resilience to epidemics or pandemics can be applied to individuals, businesses, regions or countries. Even the global resilience to pandemics could be considered. Literature about economic resilience to epidemics and pandemics is largely non-existent, I was able to find only one article related directly to it. There is literature about resilience to disasters, both natural and man-made. Some of the analogy of resilience to disasters is easily applied to the context of epidemics and pandemics, as they are natural disasters. When considering economic resilience facing a disaster such as a pandemic, it is important to take time into account. As the pandemic becomes prolonged, resilience starts to erode. Inventories start to deplete as mobility is limited and supply chains start to suffer, which causes damage to businesses relying on inventories. Individuals whose mobility is restricted spend less money. As the resilience continues to decrease, it becomes increasingly harder to implement actions that would improve the resilience of a system. As time goes on and businesses and industries suffer and potentially fail, a domino effect starts. (Rose 2009) Pandemics can have major effects on resilience, depending on the magnitude and duration of the pandemic. It is of course impossible to know how long the outbreak and its consequences last. Pandemics can challenge individual businesses and the economy as a whole, and due to this enhancing resilience with proper preparation is desirable. Individuals can also increase their personal resilience by preparing for a potential pandemic. They can also help the economic resilience in a pandemic situation by supporting businesses with continued consumption. (Rose 2009) Resilience to pandemics is a very underresearched subject and deserves more attention. As we are currently experiencing the most serious pandemic in a century, resilience to pandemics is an interesting and important topic. I am sure there will be many studies about resilience after the pandemic from several different perspectives. Future studies should consider which variables to include and how to measure for example a country’s resilience and vulnerability to pandemics. It is obvious that some countries 30 are more vulnerable than others, and not all countries are equally resilient to pandemics.  There are many factors that can contribute to vulnerability against pandemics. These include for example population density and the extent of transportation network. Regions that rely on the economic sectors that are most affected, for example tourism, are more vulnerable to suffer from a pandemic. Their recovery is also slower. This means that the industrial structure plays an important role in defining the resilience and vulnerability of a region. There are also demographic, social and cultural characteristics that add to vulnerability. Age and health of the population is a big factor in how many deaths a pandemic can potentially inflict. Social and cultural differences between countries and regions, such as the level of intimacy and attitudes towards preventive measures, also play a big role. (Cutter et al. 2008) As the mobility is reduced, rich countries where working and studying from home is possible are better equipped to keep the society running. They are also likely to have better infrastructure and health care. Rich countries are also likely to be better prepared for a pandemic and they have more options to deal with the crisis. Social safety nets are also known to be more extensive in developed countries. Developed countries, however, are often more globally linked. This increases the risks that an epidemic in some other part of the world has an impact on these countries. Small countries with small domestic markets and a reliance on international trade are especially vulnerable.  4.3 Resilience management during a pandemic Massaro et al. (2018) studied societies’ resilience during epidemics, and how different policies impact the resilience. In their research they considered the impact of an epidemic on society’s economy, infrastructure and service disruption. Both theoretical and data-driven methods were used. They combined the attack rate of disease, that is the chance for an individual to catch the disease, with human mobility deterioration caused by a disruption to the systems functionality. Their main finding was that interventions to contain an epidemic, such as travel restrictions and quarantines, may have a negative impact on a society, as they reduce resilience and lead to a slower recovery. (Massaro et al. 2018) 31 They considered many aspects in their study of resilience, including societal aspects like infrastructure and service disruption, and economic aspects such as forgone output and fiscal deficits caused by a crisis and poverty. Their study had a temporal dimension to analyse the recovery of a society. They simulated the spread of an infectious disease in connected populations and monitored the system-level response caused by the prevalence of the disease, restricted travel and social distancing. While intervention strategies reduce the risk for an individual to catch a disease, they progressively degrade the system’s functionality and resilience by degrading mobility. (Massaro et al. 2018) Important factor that mitigates the spread of an epidemic is the behavioural change in the population, caused by fear and awareness of the disease, and even the fear and awareness of others. Examples of such behaviour changes are working from home, decreased travel and avoidance of public. In addition to self-initiated social isolation there may be mandatory travel limitations further deteriorating the system’s functionality. When there are fewer human interactions, naturally the epidemic does not transfer as efficiently, and the spreading slows down. (Massaro et al. 2018) In their model, at time 𝑡, system-wide critical functionality 𝐶𝐹(𝑡) is defined as a function of the disruption to the system’s functionality caused by reduced human mobility and the risk for an individual to get the disease. It is simply the product of the fraction of active travellers 𝐴(𝑡) and the fraction of healthy population 𝐻(𝑡). Resilience 𝑟 is defined as the integral over time of the critical functionality, normalized over the control time 𝑇𝑐 and it is given by the following function (Massaro et al. 2018): 𝑟 =1𝑇𝑐∫ 𝐶𝐹(𝑡)𝑑𝑡.𝑇𝑐0 The critical functionality is calculated in a very simple way, containing only two components which are equally weighted. A more complex model could include several different components. These could include: 1) Details concerning the spread of the disease, such as mortality, infectiousness, recovery time and possible residual immunity obtained from other diseases. 32 2) Preparedness, including the availability of vaccines, hospital capacity and pharmaceuticals. 3) The socioeconomical costs caused by an outbreak and interventions, for example school closures, travel bans and quarantines. 4) Politics, media and the public perception of risk. (Massaro et al. 2018) The purpose of measures that restrict human mobility is to stop the epidemic from spreading to new areas, which are not yet affected by the disease. However, they have a significant impact on the economy and impact the delivery of services, including medical supplies and specialised personnel. Travel restrictions have significant costs, and before implementing their costs and benefits should be considered thoroughly. (Massaro et al. 2018) The authors define a global invasion threshold 𝑅∗ as a function of the inherent reproduction number of a disease, 𝑅0, and the mobility parameter 𝑝. Under no travel restrictions, we have 𝑝 = 1. When 𝑅∗ ≥ 1, the epidemic is spreading and multiplying, and therefore continuing to stay in the system. When limiting mobility, the purpose is to achieve a level of mobility that keeps the global invasion threshold from reaching one. The critical level of mobility 𝑝, when 𝑅∗ = 1,  is denoted as 𝑝𝑐. (Massaro et al. 2018) From a risk perspective, the best strategy in an epidemic outbreak is to restrict movement as much as possible, as the attack rate of the disease falls when the value of 𝑝 becomes lower. From the perspective of overall resilience, the story is different. While risk decreases when mobility is restricted and the value of  𝑝 starts to go down from 1, resilience also starts to decrease. Resilience finally starts to increase when 𝑝 =𝑝𝑐, as the epidemic is under control. (Massaro et al. 2018) 33 The reason why resilience decreases when mobility is reduced is mainly due to the critical slowing of the epidemic spreading near the invasion threshold. When the value of 𝑝 becomes lower, the spreading of the disease slows. The spread becomes increasingly slower when 𝑝 approaches 𝑝𝑐, but as the value of 𝑅∗ ≥ 1, the epidemic continues to spread. As the spread of the epidemic slows down, the risk becomes lower, but because the system must stay in a state of deteriorated functionality due to compromised mobility, its resilience suffers. The minimum resilience exists at the point where 𝑅∗ = 1, as the length of the epidemic is maximised. This is illustrated in figure 2. (Massaro et al. 2018) Figure 3. Resilience (r) and the fraction of infected population with different values of 𝒑. Figure is only illustrative.  Adapted from Massaro et al. (2018).  Another factor contributing to the spread of an epidemic is the amount of self-initiated behavioural change in a system. An individual changes behaviour when he fears catching a disease, and the fear can be increased for example by media coverage or the actions of other individuals. The number of individuals who choose to avoid risky situations by reducing movement has a similar impact to the spread of the epidemic as travel restrictions. The higher the fraction of individuals limiting their risky behaviour, 34 the lower the overall risk. When the fraction increases, resilience reduces. (Massaro et al. 2018) When implementing travel restrictions and limiting mobility in other ways, there should be a thorough cost-benefit analysis. It is also an ethical question, as not reducing travel likely leads to excess deaths and human suffering. On the other hand, setting too harsh travel restrictions compromises system’s resilience for a long period. As new epidemics emerge and information is unperfect, the natural reaction is to manage risk conservatively and limit travel. Methods such as quarantines and travel bans should be analysed well before implementing, as they may be burdensome and ineffective. (Massaro et al. 2018) Data-driven simulations also prove the theoretical models. With travel restrictions and self-initiated behaviour included, three different regimes are found: 1) With low travel reduction, a very severe epidemic spreads fast throughout the system, but due to the short duration the system goes back to normal quickly. Resilience is high. 2) When the amount of travel reduction is close to the global invasion threshold, risk is low, and a small fraction of the population gets the disease. System critical functionality, however, is compromised for a long time and the resilience is low. 3) Travel is reduced enough to keep the epidemic from reaching global invasion threshold, and it does not spread. Risk is low and resilience is high.  In the data-driven model, the required mobility level to stop the epidemic is extremely low. It is reached only with very severe travel restrictions, which are practically impossible to maintain with modern transportation networks. In practice, limiting mobility by travel restrictions or self-initiated behaviour always results in lower resilience but reduced risk. (Massaro et al. 2018)   35 5 THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC OF 2020 (COVID-19) On December 31st, 2019, Chinese authorities informed WHO of a new strain of coronavirus that had not been previously detected in humans. The virus was first detected in Wuhan, China, and likely originated in animals, possibly bats or pangolins, from which it jumped to humans. This new strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes a disease called COVID-19. (Andersen et al. 2020)  The virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets, and incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days. Symptoms range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, tiredness and muscle pain. Severe symptoms include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and sepsis. These symptoms can be fatal, and as of April 2020 there is no cure or vaccine. (Delivorias & Scholz 2020) Most of those who are infected develop a mild to moderate respiratory illness, and do not require special medical treatment. Older people, or those with underlying medical problems, are particularly vulnerable to develop a serious illness. These underlying conditions include cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, diabetes, obesity and cancer. (World Health Organization 2020) At the moment of writing this thesis, a lot of information about the virus was still unknown or uncertain. On April 13, 2020, the current case fatality rate of confirmed cases is 6,17% with 1,85 million confirmed cases and 114 300 deaths (John Hopkins University 2020). The case fatality differs a lot between countries, from 0,35% in Israel to 11% in Italy. Variation in fatality rates between countries is likely explained by differences in testing: countries that test only severe cases naturally have higher statistical death rates. As the virus can be asymptomatic, and most of the mild cases go unnoticed, the real fatality rate is likely much lower. (BBC Future 2020)  One study, using data from mainland China, estimated the crude case fatality rate to be 3,67%, after adjusting for censoring. The same study estimated the total illness fatality rate to be 0,66% in mainland China. This number includes undiagnosed cases and gives a better picture about the overall severity of the disease. The fatality rate rises quickly in the category of over 60-year olds. For the age category 60-69, infection 36 fatality rate was estimated to be 1,93%, and for individuals over 80 years the estimate was7,80%. (Verity et al. 2020)  5.1 Timeline in 2020, until April 15th. • January 7. Chinese authorities identify the virus. • January 11. First reported death in China. • January 13.
