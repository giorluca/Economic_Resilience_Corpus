In this context, biofuels and e-fuels make an important contribution to achieving climate neutrality targets, especially if their distribution can take place within existing infrastructure, as in the case of methane. The aim of this work is to carry out a techno-economic and environmental assessment of the combined pro-duction of biological and synthetic methane in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Methane yield from biogas, usually associated only with biogas upgrading, is enhanced by recovering CO2 to produce additional synthetic natural gas (SNG) through a methanation process. The analysis is applied to a medium-sized WWTP in Italy, whose biogas production profile is known throughout the year. In the current scenario, SNG is not competitive on the gas market. The investment costs of the technologies and the electricity price are then varied in order to better investigate the profitability of SNG production. The results show that, considering long-term cost projections and an electricity price of about 50 €/MWh, SNG can become competitive, with a production cost of 1.4 €/Sm3. Finally, the environmental competitiveness of SNG (direct and indirect CO2 emissions) with respect to fossil natural gas is investigated: results are shown as a function of the carbon intensity of grid electricity and the share of local renewable energy. To make SNG environmentally sustainable, the renewable share must increase to 46% or, alternatively, the carbon intensity of grid electricity must decrease to 187 gCO2eq/kWh.   1. Introduction The share of fossil fuels in the global energy mix has been consis-tently high for decades and accounted for around 80% in 2021 [1]. This has led to the release of massive amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere, which are responsible for climate change. Policies and agreements – such as the Kyoto Protocol (1997), the Paris Agreement (2015) and the Glasgow Climate Pact (2021) – have been adopted to counteract this phenomenon. In this context, bio- and e-fuels, when employed in place of fossil fuels, can contribute to the achievement of climate neutrality targets by avoiding GHG emissions [2]. Another compelling reason to invest in these fuels is that they are not only a clean energy source, but also a secure one, as they can be produced locally, which increases energy security by reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. Among alternative fuels, biomethane and synthetic methane are experiencing a strong momentum since they can be transported and exploited by means of the same gas infrastructure and end-use technologies already in place for natural gas. The European Union has recognised their potential as renewable fuels and has set targets for their production, as well as implemented some initiatives aimed at developing new technologies and increasing production, such as EU’s Horizon 2020 research program (2014–2020), Horizon Europe (2020–2027), "Fit for 55" package (2021), BIOMETHAVERSE project (2022), REPowerEU plan (2022). According to the REPowerEU plan, biomethane production must reach a target value of 35 billion of cubic meter per year by 2030 [3]. Biogas and biomethane production in Europe has grown steadily over the last 10 years, reaching 4.5% of the European Union’s gas consumption in 2021 Abbreviations: AD, Anaerobic digester; BG, Biogas; BNG, Biological natural gas; BT, Battery; EF, Emission factor; EL, Electrolyser; GHG, Greenhouse gas; HHV, Higher heating value; LCOP, Levelised cost of product; LHV, Lower heating value; MT, Methanation unit; NG, Natural gas; NTP, Normal temperature and pressure; NPC, Net present cost; O&M, Operation & maintenance; PEM, Proton exchange membrane; PV, Photovoltaic; RES, Renewable energy sources; SNG, Synthetic natural gas; SOC, State of Charge; UP, Upgrading unit; WWTP, Wastewater treatment plant. * Corresponding author.

A good opportunity to increase their production comes from sewage sludge generated in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) as part of the water cleaning process [5,6]. There are several articles in the literature on the production of bio-methane and the methanation process, but usually these processes are considered as separate arguments. Both Qyyum et al. [7] and Angelidaki et al. [8] provided a comprehensive overview of the available technologies and future pros-pects for biomethane production. Specifically, the first study focused on biogas production, cleaning technologies, current upgrading technolo-gies and possible biomethane liquefaction technologies, while the sec-ond study showed the state-of-the-art for biogas upgrading with particular attention to the emerging biological methanation processes. Other authors also examined the environmental and economic aspects of the main upgrading solutions in a life cycle perspective. For example, Ardolino et al. [9] carried out a techno-economic and environmental analysis based on data obtained mostly from existing Italian plants and the results showed the complete sustainability of the upgrading process. Many other studies only investigated the methanation process [10]. Hidalgo et al. [11] described current research and future trends on the methanation topic and also gave a general overview of power-to-methane plants in Europe. Other works focused more on the analysis of specific processes, comparing different innovative solutions and performing both a techno-economic and an environmental assess-ment [12–14]. In addition, recent studies have also focused on an innovative approach that involves the direct methanation of biogas. Gutiérrez-Martín et al. [15] explored three different configurations based on carbon dioxide (CO2) methanation, direct biogas methanation and syngas methanation. Canu et al. [16] carried out a thermodynamic analysis of the process, while Gutiérrez-Martín et al. [17] also consid-ered the economic side of the process and showed that the total cost of synthetic natural gas production is still high compared to natural gas. Instead, there is little literature on the upgrading of biogas to bio-methane and on the methanation of the biological CO2 recovered from the upgrading section. Collet et al. [18] studied methane production from sewage sludge by combining anaerobic digestion and power-to-gas technology. They performed a techno-economic analysis and a life cycle assessment for different configurations of the process and considered different technologies. A similar work was proposed by Ghafoori et al. [19], who estimated the production costs of biomethane from landfill biogas in both a standard biogas upgrading plant and an innovative plant with CO2 valorisation and methanation. In this context, the present work aims at evaluating the combined production of biological and synthetic methane from sewage gas, with the objective of an almost complete recovery of the carbon content from biogas. The analysis relies on a real case study (WWTP) with an hourly biogas production profile over the year. Starting from this specific case study, the results are then generalised through a sensitivity analysis on both environmental (carbon intensity of grid electricity, renewables share) and economic (cost of the components) parameters to provide a comprehensive overview of the boundary conditions that make CO2 methanation feasible from a techno-economic and environmental perspective, both in current and future scenarios. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 defines the case study and the available biogas hourly profile, while Section 3 describes the methodology for the techno-economic and environmental analysis and shows all the input data to the model. Results are presented and dis-cussed in Section 4 and main conclusions are summarised in Section 5. 2. Case study description The selected case study is a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located in the municipality of Collegno, near Turin, in Italy (Fig. 1). It is a medium-sized plant that serves around 200,000 equivalent in-habitants, treating an incoming wastewater inflow of 59,000 m3 per day [20] and producing about 500,000 Nm3 of biogas per year. The present work is based on the real hourly biogas production profile of the WWTP for the year 2019 (Fig. 2). The average biogas production rate is 57 Nm3/h, while peaks reach 145 Nm3/h during the winter season. The biogas flow rate follows a seasonal pattern throughout the year with a minimum value in summer (holiday season) due to lower availability of wastewater: this trend is typical for medium-sized WWTPs where most of the incoming wastewater is of residential origin [21]. In contrast, the biogas production is usually constant during the day. 3. Methodology Biological and synthetic methane production in the WWTP is investigated from a techno-economic and environmental point of view, with a focus on the potential to increase methane yield by recovering the CO2 waste stream from the upgrading process. Indeed, synthetic natural gas can be generated in a methanation reactor by combining the recovered CO2 with green hydrogen (which is generated on site through an electrolyser powered by local renewable energy sources). In this way, the plant produces both biomethane from the upgrading process (bio-logical natural gas, BNG) and synthetic methane (synthetic natural gas, SNG) from the methanation process. 3.1. Plant description The layout of the energy system analysed in this work is shown in  Fig. 3. Biogas is produced from the anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge. The biogas processing plant can be divided into two sections: 1) the biomethane production section, which includes the upgrading unit, and 2) the SNG production section, which includes the methanation unit and the electrolyser to produce green hydrogen from the on-site photovoltaic (PV) system. In the first section, biomethane is produced by converting the biogas in the upgrading unit, where the CO2 is removed from the biogas and electrical energy is consumed. In the second section, much of the recovered CO2 is used to produce synthetic methane by reacting it with H2 in a methanation reactor. The hydrogen is generated by an electro-lyser that is supplied with electricity from a photovoltaic system and the electrical grid. As shown in Fig. 3, no compression is required for the streams at the inlet of the methanation unit (i.e. CO2 and H2), as it is assumed that all components (upgrading, methanation reactor and electrolyser) operate under pressurised conditions (see Section 3.6.1) [10]. In addition, to better exploit the PV system and reduce the elec-trical energy imported from the grid, a battery storage system is also considered. The grey blocks depicted in Fig. 3 includes all the auxiliary compo-nents required for the operation of the units (e.g. water pumping system, cooling circuit and separators for the electrolysis unit).

Minardi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 10263233.2. System modelling The following section provides information on the modelling of the plant components. The main input data needed for the analysis can be found in Section 3.6. The present work is focused on the SNG production, which is high-lighted by the grey dashed line in Fig. 3. The biogas upgrading section is taken into account to evaluate the available CO2 stream (with hourly resolution) and the specific production cost of the BNG stream, but is not included in the techno-economic evaluation reported below, which indeed aims at assessing the SNG production cost. Anyway, details on the modelling of the anaerobic digester (AD) and the upgrading unit (UP) and on the evaluation of the BNG cost are shown in Appendix A. It should be noted that the following sections are based on volumetric flow rates. All volumetric flows and all the specific energy consumption values refer to normal temperature and pressure (NTP) conditions – i.e. at a temperature of 20 ◦C and a pressure of 1 atm – or, only for the SNG production cost, standard temperature and pressure (STP) conditions – i.e. temperature of 15 ◦C and a pressure of 1 atm [22]. 3.2.1. Methanation unit For this analysis, a catalytic methanation reactor is considered, specifically the one analysed in the EU project STORE&GO [23]. The main reaction that takes place is the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide [12]: Fig. 2. Biogas flow rate (hourly resolution and time horizon of one year) for the chosen WWTP. Hour 0 corresponds to January 1st, 00:00. Data are referred to year 2019. Fig. 3. Overall plant layout. The SNG production route is highlighted by the grey dashed line.  M. Minardi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 1026324CO2 + 4H2→CH4 + 2H2O Δh0298K = − 165kJmolCO2(1) For the simulation, a stoichiometric ratio of 4 moles of H2 to CO2 is assumed [24]. The key technical parameters of the methanation unit are:  • the conversion rate of the inlet CO2 (yCR,CO2 , in vol%), defined as the fraction of the inlet carbon dioxide to the methanation unit that is converted into CH4.  • the specific electrical energy consumption of the methanation unit, which takes into account the electricity demand of the auxiliary components (wMT, in kWh/Nm3SNG) • the specific thermal energy that can be recovered from the metha-nation reactor (qMT in kWh/Nm3SNG) and exploited at a temperature of 184 ◦C [23]. As shown in Fig. 3, the CO2 supplied to the methanation reactor (V̇CO2 ,MT , in Nm3/h) is a fraction of the CO2 produced by the upgrading system (V̇CO2 ,UP). As discussed in Section 4.1, this fraction is chosen to maximise the CO2 supplied to the methanation while keeping the SNG production cost close to its minimum value (i.e. without excessive oversizing of the electrolyser). The amount of CO2 entering the methanation unit that is converted into synthetic methane is defined by the conversion rate yCR,CO2 . The SNG stream leaving the methanation reaction (V̇SNG, in Nm3/h) is composed by the as-produced methane (V̇SNG,CH4 , in Nm3/h), the un-converted CO2 (V̇SNG,CO2 , in Nm3/h) and the unconverted hydrogen (V̇SNG,H2 , in Nm3/h), according to the following equations: V̇SNG,CH4 (t) = V̇CO2 ,MT(t)⋅yCR,CO2 (2)  V̇SNG,CO2 (t) = V̇CO2 ,MT(t)⋅(1 − yCR,CO2)(3)  V̇SNG,H2 (t) = V̇SNG,CO2 (t)⋅4 (4)  V̇SNG(t) = V̇SNG,CH4 (t) + V̇SNG,CO2 (t) + V̇SNG,H2 (t) (5) The electrical demand (WMT,in, in kW) and the thermal production (QMT, in kW) of the methanation unit are then evaluated based on the technical specifications of the reactor: WMT,in(t) = V̇SNG(t)⋅wMT (6)  QMT(t) = V̇SNG(t)⋅qMT (7)  3.2.2. Electrolysis unit A proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser, which operates under pressurised conditions [25], is employed for the production of hydrogen. The fast dynamic response makes PEM electrolysers a suitable choice in case of fluctuating power supply (e.g. variable renewable en-ergy sources) [26]. The specific electricity consumption of an electrolyser (wEL, in kWh/ Nm3) can be defined as the electrical power demand (of the stack and auxiliaries) per unit of hydrogen produced. This value depends on the operating point of the electrolyser. In the present work, a performance curve is therefore implemented within the model to express the specific electricity consumption of the electrolyser as a function of its operating power [27]. The electricity consumed by the electrolyser (WEL,in, in kW) can be then evaluated as: WEL,in(t) = wEL⋅V̇H2 (t) (8)  where V̇H2 (in Nm3/h) is the hydrogen flow rate produced for the selected operating point. The hydrogen required by the methanation section is derived from the stoichiometric ratio shown in Eq. (1) [24], according to the following expression: V̇H2 (t) = 4⋅V̇CO2 ,MT(t) (9)  3.2.3. Battery storage unit A Li-ion (lithium-ion) battery storage system is used to enhance the exploitation of the electrical energy generated by the PV plant. For each time step (t), the energy stored within the battery is evaluated by means of the following equation: EBT(t+ 1) = EBT (t) +WBT,in(t)⋅Δt⋅ηBT,ch −WBT,out(t)⋅ΔtηBT,dc(10)  where EBT (in kWh) is the stored energy, WBT,in (in kW) is the battery input power (charging), WBT,out (in kW) the battery output power (dis-charging), ηBT,ch is the battery charging efficiency, ηBT,dc is the battery discharging efficiency and Δt is the duration of the time interval (1 h in this analysis). To avoid premature battery degradation, the energy that can be stored in the battery is limited by a minimum and maximum state of charge (SOCBT,min and SOCBT,max, respectively), which are expressed as a percentage of the rated capacity of the battery (EBT,rated, in kWh), as shown in Eq. (11). EBT,rated⋅SOCBT,min ≤ EBT(t) ≤ EBT,rated⋅SOCBT,max (11)  3.2.4. Photovoltaic system It is considered the installation of PV panels on the roofs of the WWTP buildings to provide renewable energy for the on-site production of green hydrogen. First, the surface area of all roofs available for installing PV modules is determined. Then, using the PVGIS tool [28], the hourly production of the PV system (WPV , in kW) is evaluated for the location under analysis (Collegno, Turin). 3.3. Energy management strategy The energy simulation is performed over a reference year with an hourly resolution. For each time step, the input data are the biogas flow rate coming from the anaerobic digester and the hourly electrical energy produced by the photovoltaic system. The simulation starts with the biogas flow rate generated by the anaerobic digester. The biomethane produced and the CO2 flow rate recovered through the upgrading pro-cess are then evaluated. Knowing the value of the CO2 that is supplied to the SNG production section, the electrical energy demand of the elec-trolysis and methanation units are calculated. It should be noted that, in the simulation, the PV and battery storage systems are only used to supply electricity to the electrolysis and methanation units, but not to the upgrading system. This choice is due to the aim of the work, which focuses on the SNG production section. The electricity demand is first supplied by the PV system, then by the battery (based on the available SOC) and finally withdrawn from the grid. A complete flowchart for the energy management strategy is shown in the Supplementary Material (S. 1). 3.4. Economic analysis An economic analysis is carried out to understand the feasibility of the plant under investigation. Two economic indicators are employed to describe the economic performance of the energy system: the net present cost (NPC) and the levelised cost of product (LCOP). The analysis is presented here only for the SNG production section (see Fig. 3), as the focus of this work is to explore the economic and environmental per-formance of the SNG production route. However, in the Appendix A, the cost of the biological natural gas (BNG) from the upgrading unit is also evaluated for comparison with the SNG cost. M. Minardi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 10263253.4.1. Definition of costs The total investment cost (Cinv, in €), which occurs at the beginning of the analysis period, is given by the sum of the investment costs for all i-th components of the system (whose specific investment costs are re-ported in Table 2). The annual net operating cost (Cop,t , in €/y), computed according to Eq. (12), can be divided into operation and maintenance costs (CO&M,i), replacement costs (Crep,i), purchase of electricity from the grid (Cgrid,imp) and incomes from the plant sub-products. The incomes include the revenues for the electricity sold to the grid (Rgrid,exp) and the natural gas saving due to heat recovery within the WWTP (Rheat). Cop,t =∑i(CO&M,i +Crep,i)+Cgrid,imp −(Rgrid,exp +Rheat)(12) For each i-th component, the annual O&M costs (CO&M,i) are calcu-lated as a percentage of its investment cost. Replacement costs (Crep,i) are also computed as a percentage of the investment cost; they are due to the replacement of the electrolyser stack, the PV inverter and the battery modules over the plant lifetime. The Cgrid,imp term is due to the electricity imported from the grid (Wgrid,imp) when the PV system and the battery storage cannot satisfy the total electrical demand. Wgrid,imp can be eval-uated as: Wgrid,imp(t) = WEL,in(t)+WMT,in(t) − WPV,out(t) − WBT,out(t) (13)  where WEL,in and WMT,in are the electrical power required by the elec-trolyser and methanation units, while WPV,out and WBT,out are the elec-trical power supplied by the PV and battery systems. The revenues for the excess electricity (Rgrid,exp,) are estimated based on the amount PV electricity that is exported to the grid (Wgrid,exp), which is defined according to the following expression: Wgrid,exp(t) = WPV(t) − WPV,out(t) − WBT,in(t) (14)  where WPV is the total electrical power coming from the PV system, of which WPV,out is the share fed directly into the electrolyser and the methanation units and WBT,in is the share sent to the battery storage. The savings (Rheat) for the heat recovered from the methanation section (computed through Eq. (7)) are calculated as the avoided natural gas that would have been required to produce the same amount of en-ergy with a gas boiler (taking into account the efficiency of a traditional gas boiler). It is assumed that all recoverable heat is exploited within the WWTP, especially for the anaerobic digester heating, for which the thermal load is assessed according to the methodology shown in [29, 30]. 3.4.2. Economic indicators The final objective of the economic analysis is to evaluate two eco-nomic indicators: the net present cost of the system (NPCSNG, in €) and the levelised cost of product (LCOPSNG, in €/Sm3). The former is the present value of all the costs that the SNG production system incurs over its lifetime (minus the present value of all the revenues\\\\savings) and is computed as follows: NPCSNG = Cinv +∑nt=1Cop,t(1 + d)t(15)  where Cinv is the sum of the initial investment costs of all the components involved the system under analysis (i.e. for SNG production: PV system, battery storage, electrolyser, methanation unit, and heat recovery sys-tem), Cop,t is net operating cost during the t-th year (derived through Eq. (12)), d (in %) is the discount rate, and n (in years) is the lifetime of the plant. The LCOPSNG indicator represents the average cost per unit of the as- produced SNG. It is calculated as the ratio between the NPCSNG indicator and the discounted sum of annual SNG production: LCOPSNG =NPCSNG∑nt=1VSNG,y⋅(1 + d)− t (16)  where VSNG,y (in Sm3/y) is the annual production of SNG. This term is obtained as the sum, over one year, of the hourly values derived from Eq. (5), converted from Nm3 to Sm3 (this conversion is done for comparison with the gas market price). A similar approach is employed for the evaluation of the levelised cost of BNG, as discussed in Appendix A. A detailed investigation of the BNG production process is beyond the scope of this work but its pro-duction cost (LCOPBNG) has been assessed and is presented in the Results section for comparison with the SNG route. 3.5. Environmental analysis According to the Italian Ministerial Decree on biomethane [31], both biological and synthetic methane (if produced by the methanation of renewable hydrogen and CO2 contained in the biogas) are considered as biofuels of biological origin and can access the available incentive. Furthermore, biogas is considered a near carbon-neutral energy source, as the carbon dioxide emitted during its combustion and use is equal to the amount of carbon absorbed during the growth of the biomass from which it was produced [32,33]. The environmental analysis is developed according to a Scope 2 approach that accounts for both direct (e.g. fossil fuels combustion) and indirect (e.g. purchase of grid electricity) emissions. In order to evaluate the environmental sustainability of the SNG production route, the carbon ratio RCO2 (-) is introduced to compare the emissions from the use of SNG and those from fossil natural gas (see  Fig. 4). The carbon ratio can be defined as follows: RCO2 =MCO2 ,SNGMCO2 ,NG(17)  where MCO2 ,SNG (in kgCO2eq/y) is the CO2 equivalent emissions associated with the SNG, from the waste CO2 feeding the methanation unit to the use phase. This includes only the CO2 equivalent emissions related to the electricity taken from the grid to power the electrolyser and the methanation units, since the CO2 emitted during the combustion process has a net balance with the recovered one, which was already present in the atmosphere). The second term, MCO2 ,NG (in kgCO2eq/y), is the CO2 equivalent emissions associated with fossil natural gas (i.e. upstream and combustion emissions related to an amount of fossil natural gas equal to the amount of SNG produced by the plant under analysis). The MCO2 ,SNG and MCO2 ,NG terms (in kg) are computed according to Eqs. (18) and (19) respectively. MCO2 ,SNG =∑8760t=1Wgrid,imp(t)⋅Δt⋅εgrid⋅10− 3 (18)  MCO2 ,NG =∑8760t=1V̇SNG(t)⋅Δt⋅ΔhSNG⋅εNG⋅10− 3 (19)  where εgrid (in gCO2eq/kWh) is the carbon intensity of grid electricity, ΔhSNG (in MJ/Nm3) is the lower heating value of the synthetic natural gas (which depends on the fuel content of the produced SNG), εNG (in gCO2eq/MJ) is the emission factor (upstream and combustion emissions) of the fossil natural gas, and Δt is the duration of the time interval (1 h in this analysis). The Wgrid,imp term (in kW) is estimated through Eq. (13), whereas V̇SNG (in Nm3/h) is derived according to Eq. (5). A carbon ratio of 1 means that, when combusted, the bio-based SNG releases the same amount of CO2 equivalent emissions as would be released by fossil natural gas. At values above 1, the SNG emits more CO2 equivalent than fossil natural gas, making it unsustainable from an environmental point of view. On the contrary, for values below 1, the M. Minardi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 1026326use of the SNG is responsible of a lower amount of CO2 equivalent than the fossil alternative. As a limit scenario, a carbon ratio of zero corre-sponds to the case where the term MCO2 ,SNG is zero. In this scenario, the electricity comes exclusively from renewable energy sources (local generation or guarantees of origin) and there are no CO2 emissions (within the Scope 2 control volume) associated with the SNG. It is noteworthy that the considerations derived from this analysis also apply to any waste CO2 stream, further broadening the relevance and the applicability of the results. 3.6. Techno-economic and environmental input data 3.6.1. Technical data The main technical input data are shown in Table 1. For what concerns the PEM electrolyser, the specific electricity consumption (wEL) is a function of the electrolyser operating point (which is expressed as the ratio between the inlet electrical power and the nominal power of the electrolyser). The wEL term refers to the entire electrolyser system, including both the stack and the balance-of-plant components. The specific electricity consumption curve, retrieved from [34], shows a minimum of 3.9 kWh/Nm3 (LHV efficiency of 71%) for a load of 15%, while for higher loads the consumption increases to 4.7 kWh/Nm3 (LHV efficiency of 60%) at nominal load. The chosen conversion rate for the methanation section is 99.5%: starting from an equilibrium concentration in the range 96%-98%, and employing multiple reactors in series (as shown in [35]), higher con-version rates (up to 99.5%-99.6%) can be achieved [10]. It is also supposed that the upgrading, methanation and electrolysis units operate at the same pressure (neglecting pressure drops in the components). A value of 14 bar is assumed, as it is consistent with the operating ranges of the various components reported in the literature [27,36,37]. The gas boiler efficiency (to estimate the savings from the recovered heat) is set equal to 95% [38]. 3.6.2. Economic data The values assumed for the main economic parameters are shown in  Table 2. There is no cost for the CO2 stream recovered from the upgrading unit, as it is a by-product of the upgrading process. The cost of the water for the electrolyser is also neglected, as clean water is avail-able from the outlet stream of the WWTP. The price of energy vectors, such as the electricity imported from the grid, the excess PV electricity exported to the grid and the natural gas consumed by the plant, are estimated for the year 2019 for the Italian scenario (to avoid the price fluctuations of the 2020–2022 energy crisis). A sensitivity analysis is also performed to underline the effect of energy prices on the economic feasibility of the SNG production plant. The reference import prices of electricity and gas are retrieved from the Eurostat database and refer to Fig. 4. Biogenic SNG and fossil NG control volumes employed for the environmental analysis. Dashed red lines are associated with the biogenic CO2, which is not accounted in the carbon balance. Table 1 Technical parameters for the energy system.  Parameter Symbol Value Unit Ref.

Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 1026327non-household consumers (excluding VAT and other recoverable taxes and levies) for Italy [40,41]. The revenues from the excess PV electricity sold to the grid are calculated assuming that the electricity is sold at a price equal to the average national electricity price (Prezzo Unico Nazionale, PUN) during 2019. The PUN indicator stands for the wholesale price of energy exchanged between producers and suppliers in the national market. In order to explore the economic profitability of the SNG production route also in future scenarios, cost projections for the technologies are applied according to the data presented in Table 3. A reduction in the specific investment cost for the electrolysis, methanation and PV units are foreseen for the next decades (from 2030 to 3050). Regarding the methanation reactor, two cost projections are employed, as investigated during the STORE&GO project [42]: the first one (reference trend) shows the decrease in cost of a standard methanation reactor, while the second one (optimised trend) refers to an optimised reactor where im-provements are assumed for what concerns gas compression, catalyst cost and required mass, and gas hourly space velocity. 3.6.3. Environmental data The input data for the environmental analysis employs are the car-bon intensity of the grid electricity (for Italy, 2021 [50]) and the emission factor of natural gas [51]. These values are both expressed as CO2 equivalent emissions per unit of energy, as shown in Table 4. A sensitivity analysis on the electricity carbon intensity is also conducted (from 0 to 500 gCO2eq/kWh) to evaluate its effect on the environmental performance of the analysed process. 4. Results 4.1. Energy assessment The sizes and the results of the energy simulation are shown in  Table 5. The nominal size of the solar PV system (920 kW) is defined so as to cover the entire available roof area with PV modules. The rated capacity of the battery is set at 2 MWh, as higher values do not bring any significant energy improvements. Specifically, the chosen battery size allows to maximise the electrical load covered by the PV, as indicated in the Supplementary Material (S.2). The electrolyser size is chosen based on a sensitivity analysis, as show in Fig. 5 where the SNG production cost (namely, LCOPSNG) and the processed CO2 (i.e. the percentage fraction of the available CO2 from the upgrading unit that is supplied to the methanation reactor) are displayed as a function of the electrolyser rated power. A cost-optimal value (LCOPSNG equal to 3.86 €/Sm3) is found for an electrolyser size of 290 kW. However, this point corresponds to a pro-cessed CO2 of 71.6% (i.e. 28.4% of the available carbon dioxide from the upgrading unit is not sent to the methanation unit and thus not converted). On the contrary, the CO2-optimal point (with minimum cost) cor-responds to an electrolyser size of 930 kW (which is able to capture all the carbon dioxide recovered from the upgrading unit) and leads to a production cost of 4.59 €/Sm3. In this scenario, 100% of the recovered CO2 is fed to the methanation unit to be processed. The chosen design point (blue dots in the figure) is a trade-off be-tween the cost-optimal and the CO2-optimal solutions and it is associ-ated with an electrolyser size of 550 kW. In this configuration, the production cost is equal to 4.05 €/Sm3 (+4.8% compared to the mini-mum value) and the processed CO2 is 96.6% (i.e. only 3.4% of the available CO2 is not sent to the methanation unit). The goal of the chosen sizing approach is to convert as much CO2 as possible while avoiding too large system oversizing (which would lead to an increase in the final SNG production cost). Details on the energy simulation profiles during the year can be found in the Supplementary Material (S.3). With this configuration (electrolyser size equal to 550 kW), the plant produces 330 kNm3/y of biological natural gas (BNG) and 165 kNm3/y Table 3 Cost projections for 2030 and 2050 scenarios.

Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 1026328of synthetic natural gas (SNG), through the recovery of 297 t/y of CO2 from the upgrading unit. The electrical energy required for the elec-trolysis and methanation unit is 3031 MWh/y, of which 67.5% is im-ported from the grid and the remaining 32.5% comes from the PV system (with support from battery storage system). The PV plant produces 1050 MWh/y, of which 97% is used for the electricity needs of the SNG pro-duction section and the remaining 32 MWh/y are exported to the grid. Finally, a heat recovery system enables to recover 258 MWh/y from the methanation unit, which can be used to meet about 9.1% of the thermal energy demand associated with the anaerobic digester. 4.2. Economic assessment Fig. 6 shows the net present cost (NPC) and the breakdown of in-vestment and operating terms for the current scenario and for the sce-narios with the future cost projections. The results are evaluated here considering the reference electricity import price of 163.2 €/MWh (Table 2) and the reference trend for the methanation unit (Table 3). The economic analysis shows that the NPC amounts to 8.54 M€ in the cur-rent scenario (Fig. 6a). Specifically, operating costs account for the largest share (63.7%) and are dominated by the electricity withdrawn from the grid (Fig. 6c). Investment costs (Fig. 6b) make up for the remaining 36.3% and consist of the cost of the methanation reactor (30.9%), followed by the PV plant and the battery storage (23.4% and 22.9% respectively), the electrolyser (21.3%) and finally the heat re-covery unit (1.5%). Considering the future projections for the investment costs of the technologies (as defined in Table 3), the NPC could decrease by 16.9% (7.10 M€) in the short term and by 36.7% (5.94 M€) in the long term. As shown by the blue areas in Fig. 6a, the share of investment costs in the total NPC decreases in the future scenarios from 36.3% (current) to 29.1% (short term) and 20.9% (long term). The methanation unit is always the most expensive component and accounts for 31%-33% of the investment costs in all scenarios. It is worth noting that the operating costs are the largest contributor to the NPC, mainly due to the costs associated with the large amount of electricity imported from the grid for the electrolysis process (“Energy” bar in Figure c). Their influence increases in the future scenarios due to the decrease in investment costs and accounts for 63.7%, 70.9% and 79.1% of the total NPC in the current, short-term and long-term sce-narios, respectively (green areas in Fig. 6a). The resulting value for LCOPSNG is 4.05 €/Sm3 in the current scenario and decreases to 3.36 €/Sm3 and 2.72 €/Sm3 in the short- and long-term scenarios, respectively. The NPC analysis discussed so far has highlighted the key role of operating costs, and in particular the electricity contribution, in the economic feasibility of SNG production. To better investigate this aspect, a sensitivity analysis on the price of electricity is then carried out, increasing it up to 350 €/MWh. Fig. 7 shows how the LCOPSNG changes in the current scenario as a function of the electricity import price. It can be observed that the green area labelled “Energy” (which is dominated by the cost of the electricity purchased from the grid) decreases as the price of electricity decreases. Even at low electricity prices of about 50 €/MWh (which are representative for photovoltaic or wind power plants [52]), the LCOPSNG is not economically competitive within the existing gas market, reaching a value of 2.62 €/Sm3. The EU gas market exhibited values above 1 €/Sm3 only during the 2022 energy crisis (with peaks up to about 3.3 €/Sm3 in August 2022) and the average price is usually below 1 €/Sm3 (e.g. average values of about 0.4–0.5 €/Sm3 in Q1-Q2 2023) [53]. As can be seen in Fig. 7, even if the price of electricity falls, there is still an important cost share (dominated by the investment costs), which makes the SNG production not competitive. The production cost of biological natural gas (LCOPBNG) is also shown in the graph (orange dashed line) and ranges from 0.24 to 0.35 €/Sm3 depending on the cost of the electricity. The current biological pathway of biomethane production is indeed already competitive within the gas market, while more technological learning and incentives are needed to make SNG production viable. The costs shown in Fig. 7 are in line with those reported in literature for this type of plant. Böhm et al. [54] estimated the SNG cost to be between 3.14 and 8.37 €/Sm3, while Schlautmann et al. [55] found slightly lower values in the range 2.72–4.19 €/Sm3. Fig. 6. NPC for the current, short-term and long-term cost projections (a), with contributions for the investment cost (b) and the operating costs (c). The “en-ergy” term refers to the cost of imported electricity net of revenues and savings. A reference electricity import price of 163.2 €/MWh is considered. M. Minardi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 1026329The profitability of SNG production was also investigated for future cost projections (defined in Table 3) and is shown in Fig. 8. The graph compares the LCOPSNG for the three scenarios (green lines) with the purchase price of biomethane in Italy in 2019 (orange dashed lines) and 2022 (yellow dashed lines) [56], both without incentives (darker col-ours, 0.17 €/Sm3 and 1.25 €/Sm3, respectively) and with incentives (lighter colours, 0.48 €/Sm3 and 1.56 €/Sm3, respectively). The in-centives for biomethane injection into the natural gas grid, in Italy, are currently provided for both biological (from biogas upgrading) and synthetic (produced from biological CO2) methane. According to [57], biofuels can be classified as “advanced” (usually from biological sub-products and waste streams) and “not advanced”, depending on the biomass source. The sewage biogas is included in the “advanced” bio-fuels. The incentives for grid injection consist of 375 € per CIC (“Cer-tificati di Immissione in Consumo”), for a maximum period of 10 years. Each individual CIC is given for the injection into the national gas grid of a quantity of 5 Gcal of advanced biofuels (10 Gcal for not-advanced biofuels) [58]. The attractiveness of SNG production is improved by reducing the investment costs for the technologies. In particular, competitiveness is achieved in the long-term scenario, where LCOPSNG reaches a value of 1.39 €/Sm3 with an electricity import price of 50 €/MWh. This value is close to the gas prices in 2022, while still above gas prices before the energy crisis (2019). Methane is indeed a relatively cheap commodity, which makes it difficult for SNG to become economically convenient. Fig. 8 also shows that at very low electricity prices (below about 20 €/MWh), the SNG production cost could reach values similar to 2022 gas prices. Even in future scenarios, the SNG costs are in line with those reported in the literature by Böhm et al. [54], who obtained a value of 1.57 €/Sm3. In contrast, Schlautmann et al. [55] estimated a more optimistic value of 0.94 €/Sm3. Since the methanation unit is the component that has the greatest impact on the total CAPEX, the impact of an improved methanation reactor design is also assessed (i.e. optimised trend in Table 3). The results of the optimised trend and the comparison with the reference trend are included in the Supplementary Material (S.4). It is found that the cost projections of the optimised trend have a rather negligible impact on the economic assessment compared to the reference trend. It should also be noted that no specific subsidy for CO2 recovery is considered in this analysis, which would further improve the attrac-tiveness of the SNG production process. 4.3. Environmental assessment The results of the environmental analysis are summarised in Fig. 9. The map shows the value of the carbon ratio (RCO2 , defined in Eq. (17)) as a function of the carbon intensity of the grid electricity (in gCO2eq/ kWh) and the RES share (in %). The latter term is defined as the fraction of total electricity consumption of the SNG production process that is covered by local RES (for which the carbon intensity is zero). The white point in the map refers to the analysed case study: the carbon intensity of the electrical grid in Italy is 234 gCO2eq/kWh [49] and the share of electricity covered by the on-site PV plant is 32.5%, as discussed in Section 4.1. The resulting carbon ratio for this case study is 1.25. This means that the SNG production process, if supplied with the on-site PV system (32.5%) and the electrical grid (67.5%), would result in more CO2 emissions than those released by using the same amount of Fig. 7. Levelised cost of SNG (LCOPSNG) as a function of the electricity import price (for the current scenario). The “energy” term refers to the cost of imported electricity (net of revenues and savings). The orange dashed line represents the cost for the production of BNG through the upgrading unit (LCOPBNG). Fig. 8.

M. Minardi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 10263210fossil natural gas (+25%). To achieve a carbon ratio of less than 1 (i.e. the SNG-based route leads to a lower amount of CO2 equivalent than the fossil alternative), the RES share must be higher than 46% (horizontal dashed arrow) or, alternatively, the carbon intensity of electricity must decrease to 187 gCO2eq/kWh (vertical dashed arrow). Overall, the map shows the combinations of electricity carbon in-tensity and RES share that make the SNG production process environ-mentally sustainable (RCO2 < 1) compared to fossil NG. It should be noted that, if only electricity from the grid is employed (RES share equal to zero), a carbon ratio lower than 1 is achieved for a carbon intensity of grid electricity below 127 gCO2eq/kWh. 5. Conclusions The aim of this study is to investigate the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of the combined production of biological (BNG) and synthetic (SNG) methane in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The energy simulation shows that it is possible to increase the total production of methane within the plant by 50%: from 330 kNm3/y when only biomethane is produced through upgrading, to 495 kNm3/y by adding 165 kNm3/y of SNG, obtained from methanation of the recov-ered CO2. The economic analysis reveals that, in the current scenario, the operating costs account for the largest share (63.7%), primarily due to the electricity drawn from the grid for the electrolysis process. The remaining 36.3% of the total expenses are attributed to investment costs, which consists in the methanation reactor (30.9%), the PV plant and the battery storage (23.4% and 22.9% respectively), the electrolyser (21.3%) and finally the heat recovery unit (1.5%). The levelised cost of synthetic natural gas (LCOPSNG) is found to be 4.05 €/Sm3 in the current scenario. However, with future cost pro-jections for the investment costs of the technologies, the LCOPSNG can decrease to 3.36 €/Sm3 and 2.72 €/Sm3 in the short- and long-term scenarios, respectively. This study also underlines the importance of the electricity price for the economic feasibility of SNG production. Even at low electricity prices (which are representative of electricity pro-duction from local renewable energy sources), the levelised cost of SNG cannot compete with the NG market price in the current scenario. However, with a future reduction in the cost of technologies and low electricity prices (of about 50 €/MWh), the production cost of SNG be-comes competitive, reaching a value of 1.39 €/Sm3 in the long-term scenario. Regarding the environmental analysis, a carbon ratio (RCO2 ) of 1.25 is computed for the selected case study. This means that, when operated with local PV (sized according to the available roof area) and grid electricity, the SNG-based route results in 25% more CO2 equivalent emissions than the fossil alternative. To make the SNG environmentally sustainable compared to fossil NG (i.e. a carbon ratio below 1), the RES share must be above 46% or, alternatively, the carbon intensity of grid electricity must drop to 187 gCO2eq/kWh. In summary, this study investigates the potential of combined bio-logical and synthetic methane production from sewage biogas. While the current production costs of SNG cannot compete with natural gas, future cost projections and favourable electricity prices could make SNG pro-duction economically viable. Moreover, achieving a beneficial carbon footprint in the selected case study requires a higher RES share or a reduction in the carbon intensity of grid electricity. Future works will explore further case studies (e.g. other biogas sources) and the imple-mentation of high temperature electrolysis to verify the advantages of a different technology for the hydrogen production process and its possible thermal integration into the biogas plant.

Appendix A The following section shows the methodology and the input data for the modelling of the anaerobic digester (AD) and the biogas upgrading unit (UP). The AD section is only investigated in terms of heat demand (following the methodology illustrated in [29,30] and validated for the specific case study) in order to verify the integration between the heat recovered from the methanation unit and the heat demand of the digester. The modelling of the UP section is required to evaluate the CO2 flow rate that can be recovered and the BNG production cost, but it is not included in the detailed techno-economic assessment of the SNG production route. Anaerobic digester The anaerobic digester is the component in which the sludge is stabilised, producing biogas and a solid biomass, called digestate. The organic matter remains in an anaerobic environment at a temperature of about 35–40 ◦C (mesophilic conditions) with an hydraulic retention time of about 20 days [59]. An external heating system is used to keep a constant temperature level inside the reactor [30]. Biogas can be considered as a sub-product of the anaerobic process in WWTPs since the main goal of the process is to stabilise the incoming sludges, which can then be used as secondary fuel in furnaces or landfilled.

Journal of CO2 Utilization 78 (2023) 10263211The molar composition of the inlet biogas is assumed to be 65% CH4 and 35% CO2 (average value for the selected WWTP [20,21,59,60]). Upgrading unit Membrane separation is used for the upgrading unit. It is currently the most widely diffused technology for CO2 capture both in Italy and Europe [4]. In this work, the upgrading unit is modelled as a black-box into which the biogas enters and two streams (i.e. biomethane and CO2) exit. The electrical energy consumption of the unit is also estimated (e.g. due to compressors). The following parameters are needed by the UP model:  ▪ the methane recovery ratio (RUP,CH4 , in vol%), i.e. the fraction of the methane contained in the inlet biogas stream that is recovered through the upgrading process.  ▪ the CO2 loss (fBG,CO2 ,loss, in %), i.e. the carbon dioxide contained in the inlet BG stream that is not separated from the methane. It is expressed as a percentage of the inlet carbon dioxide.  ▪ the specific electrical energy consumption of the upgrading system (wUP, in kWh/Nm3BG). By knowing the values of the technical specifications (see Table A1), the methane content in the BNG stream at the outlet of the upgrading unit (V̇BNG,CH4 , in Nm3/h) and the required input power to the upgrading unit (WUP, in kW) can be evaluated from Eq. (A1) and Eq. (A2): V̇BNG,CH4 (t) = V̇BG,CH4 (t)⋅RUP,CH4 (A1)  WUP(t) = V̇BG(t)⋅wUP (A2)  where V̇BG,CH4 (in Nm3/h) is the methane content in the biogas stream entering the upgrading unit and V̇BG (in Nm3/h) is the overall biogas feeding the upgrading unit (whose profile is displayed in Fig. 2 for the case study under investigation). As shown in Table A1, the methane recovery ratio (RUP,CH4 ) for the methane contained in the inlet biogas stream is assumed to be 100%. From the model of the upgrading unit, the flow rate of CO2 exiting the upgrading unit (V̇CO2 ,UP, in Nm3/h) can be expressed as follows: V̇CO2 ,UP(t) = V̇BG,CO2 (t) − V̇CO2 ,loss(t) (A3)  which can be rearranged as: V̇CO2 ,UP(t) = V̇BG(t)⋅yBG,CO2 ⋅(1 − fBG,CO2 ,loss)(A4)  where yBG,CO2 (in vol%) is the fraction of carbon dioxide in the inlet biogas stream and fBG,CO2 ,loss (in %) is the CO2 loss within the upgrading section. The CO2 stream that is not separated within the UP unit is then removed by a final purification system before the BNG is injected into the grid. The biomethane fed into the grid is then evaluated as: V̇BNG(t) =V̇BNG,CH4 (t)yBNG,CH4(A5)  where yBNG,CH4 is the methane content (vol%) in the BNG outlet stream after the final purification step, and it is equal to 100%. Finally, the levelised cost of product for the BNG stream (LCOPBNG, in €/Sm3) can be assessed as follows: LCOPBNG =NPCBNG∑nt=1VBNG,y⋅(1 + d)− t (A6)  where NPCBNG (in €) is the net present cost of the biogas upgrading section and VBNG,y (in Sm3/y) is the annual production of BNG. This last term is evaluated as the sum, over 1 year, of the hourly BNG flow rate values (derived in Eq. (A5), and converted from Nm3 to Sm3). The NPCBNG term includes the investment cost for the upgrading section, the annual operating costs (O&M) and the cost of the electricity supplied to the unit.
