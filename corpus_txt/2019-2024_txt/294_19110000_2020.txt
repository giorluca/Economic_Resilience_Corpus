Certain countries like Greece suffered a prolonged (and ongoing) economic crisis while others, Portugal and Ireland as discussed in this thesis, had periods of crisis but returned to normalcy after some time. Commitment to certain policies at the national level cannot fully explain the speed of these recoveries; Portugal and Ireland, for instance, had different levels of commitment to and popular willingness to endure austerity measures. All three countries will be discussed considering their parliamentary structures (i.e. whether governments held a parliamentary majority, were maintained by an ideologically consistent coalition, etc.) to show that the power and decisiveness of ruling parties played some role in economic recovery.  Introduction  The 2007-2008 financial crisis clearly outlined the interconnected nature of the global economy. While the crisis was set off by a much higher than expected default rate in the American subprime mortgage sector, the devaluation of assets related to the sector caused an outward cascade of panic among investors worldwide; soon, much of the globe was experiencing the same crisis. John L. Campbell and John A. Hall go as to say in their book The Paradox of Vulnerability that the collapse of the American financial firm Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 was a direct cause of the following economic crisis in Ireland.1 Given the scope of the crisis, major national, supranational and international political institutions were driven to respond to the crisis in order to move the world’s economies toward stability and recovery; from this, there arises a general question of how economic policy adapted by different governing bodies influenced the recoveries (or lack thereof) of countries around the world following the financial crisis.  For countries in the so-called ‘periphery’ of the euro area, relatively smaller economies than those of ‘core’ member states like Germany and France, the conditions that led to crises of investor confidence and of unsustainable debt and deficit hold some similarities. After accession to the eurozone, countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland were able to borrow at extremely  1 John L. Campbell and John A. Hall, The Paradox of Vulnerability: States, Nationalism, and the Financial Crisis (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2017), 91. 2  low interest rates from financial institutions in ‘core’ European Union countries due to the single currency, leading to nearly free lending conditions.2 However, when the 2007-8 crisis hit Europe, this led to a massive capital flight from the periphery back to institutions in the core; many countries found themselves in the midst of sudden debt crises. Chart 1. GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)  Several factors complicate analysis of these economic crises. Certain euro area peripheral countries like Ireland and Portugal have, in one way or another, demonstrated a full economic recovery and growth and have shown increasing employment and investor confidence as measured through government bond yields in recent years. In terms of GDP per capita, Ireland and Portugal have both surpassed their 2007 and 2008 levels with relative ease; as of 2018,  2 Campbell and Hall, 83-84. 01000020000300004000050000600007000080000900002001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)YearEuro area Greece Ireland Portugal3  Greece had only just nearly recovered to their pre-crisis level of GDP per capita (Chart 1).3 Despite the three countries sharing the same currency and, thus, sharing the same monetary policy, the severity and lengths of their economic crises and the scale and speed of their economic recoveries were quite different. What accounts for these differences? The following thesis will argue that the structure of parliamentary power within peripheral euro area member states can account for the asymmetry of economic crises and recoveries related to the late 2000s global financial crisis. Using the case studies of Ireland, Portugal and Greece, it will be shown that governing parties or ideologically consistent/goal-oriented coalitions with the majority of seats within the national parliamentary structure of any given country corresponded with a ability toward economic recovery; by ability, this author is referring to just that – a majority government, for instance, does not guarantee economic recovery but simply a variable which can enable recovery to occur. For the purposes of this thesis, the author has chosen to characterize the presence of decreased 10-year government bond yields and/or decreased unemployment to pre-crisis or near-pre-crisis levels as a signal of economic recovery. Low bond yields, a sign that foreign bond market investors view a country’s economy as stable and holding little risk, and low unemployment, a measure of the proportion of a national job market which is jobless and actively seeking work, do not in all instances co-exist and can imply different, even if often compatible, notions about the state of an economy. However, both indicate increased activity or at the very least great potential for increased activity within a national economy and thus are both appropriate in indicating economic recovery. Literature Review  3 “GDP per capita, PPP (current international $) – Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Euro area,” World Bank, International Comparison database, last updated 2018. <https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=GR-IE-PT-XC>. 4   There have been several pieces of literature analyzing asymmetric economic recoveries from shared crises; one of the most recent pieces of literature and perhaps the most relevant to this thesis is John L. Campbell and John A. Hall’s 2017 book The Paradox of Vulnerability. The authors argue that small states with strong national identities and ‘thick’ (strong) institutions guided by expert advice perceive themselves as vulnerable to outside attack and therefore react to crises decisively and effectively. Campbell and Hall focus on Denmark, Ireland and Switzerland as three examples of the model in action, with Denmark as their ‘ideal’ model and the Swiss/Irish as examples of how modifications to the model can be made. In their application of the model to Ireland, the only country they observe which utilizes the euro as its currency, , the authors argue that the 2008 crisis was brought on by huge amounts of public and private spending on real estate and construction in the 2000s mostly financed by other European countries; when Ireland acceded to the euro area in the early 2000s, it suddenly had access to capital at extremely low interest rates.4 According to Hall and Campbell, as Lehman Brothers and other global financial institutions collapsed and a liquidity crisis within Ireland’s banks was triggered, foreign capital flooded out of Ireland back toward the rest of Europe; a guarantee  made by the Irish government to insure deposits for ailing banks additionally allowed for the accumulation of debt and the sustenance of a large deficit, adding an additional crisis to Ireland’s worries on top of the banking crisis.5 Hall and Campbell to some extent also suggest that a supposed hubris of Irish officials led to the crisis through ‘thin’ (rather than ‘thick’) institutions guided by politics rather than economic expertise.6  4 Campbell and Hall, 83-84. 5 Campbell and Hall, 91-93. 6 Campbell and Hall, 103-106. 5   If institutional thinness is what led Ireland into sustained crisis, what eventually led the economy toward recovery? Campbell and Hall note several factors: luck, insofar as the euro remained quite weak compared to the US dollar and UK pound sterling allowing for an increase in Irish net exports.7 Another suggestion they make is that “the presence of a cluster of high-powered, flexible human capital” within Ireland, established during the Celtic Tiger era, led to an increased willingness from the international community to reinvest in Ireland.8 This latter point is rather important to Campbell and Hall’s argument; the Greek crisis serves as something of a counterexample to their argument for the Irish recovery. The authors suggest that while Greece had many of the same problems Ireland was facing in terms of massive capital outflow, the accumulation of debt and the sustenance of a large deficit and some measure of institutional thinness.9 However, the authors contend that “Greece was unlike Ireland in one very important respect – Greece did not develop hidden economic strength during the earlier period of growth,” -  in Ireland’s case the cluster of human capital - “that might have facilitated a fairly rapid recovery from the financial crisis.”10  7 Campbell and Hall, 105. 8 Campbell and Hall, 105-106. 9 Campbell and Hall, 159. 10 Campbell and Hall, 159-160. 6   While it is true that the presence of human capital has been associated with strong national economic performance, a third country complicates Campbell and Hall’s distinction between Ireland and Greece: Portugal. Despite an observed lack of ‘hidden economic strength’ in the form of human capital in Portugal established prior to the crisis,11 the Portuguese economy appears to have staged a recovery in terms of decreased unemployment (Chart 2).12 This author would contend that while the Campbell and Hall model accurately explains some aspects of Ireland’s economic recovery (and Greece’s lack thereof) but misses some elements of this asymmetry. Proposed Model  Moral and political philosopher Brian Barry’s 1980 essay “Is it Better to be Powerful or Lucky?” may provide some guidance in considering the variables at stake within the discussion at hand. In his piece, Barry was attempting to offer an “alternative way of thinking about” political power and the chance that a political actor will accomplish or ‘succeed’ at some given  11 See Stéphanie Guichard and Bénédicte Larre, “Enhancing Portugal’s Human Capital,” OECD Economics Department Working Papers no. 505 (2006). <https://doi.org/10.1787/871641300584>. 12 See World Bank, “GDP per capita.” See “Portugal’s Economic Recovery: How Much Came from Ditching Austerity?,” Knowledge@Wharton, August 1, 2018, <https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/portugals-economic-recovery-how-much-came-from-ditching-austerity/>; See “Unemployment by sex and age – monthly average,” Eurostat, last updated March 24, 2020, <https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-datasets/-/UNE_RT_M>. 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.020.02006 January2006 September2007 May2008 January2008 September2009 May2010 January2010 September2011 May2012 January2012 September2013 May2014 January2014 September2015 May2016 January2016 September2017 May2018 January2018 September2019 May2020 JanuaryUnemploymentDateChart 2.

Thought about in terms of a hypothetical committee of political actors, luck is defined as the “proportion of adventitious successes” that a committee member has if they do nothing whatsoever; this can also be understood as the probability that one’s surroundings in and of themselves will grant this actor with some advantage (e.g. everyone on the committee agrees on a number of issues).15 Decisiveness, on the other hand, is the “proportion of adventitious successes” that a committee member has if they do act; this can be understood as the probability that an actor’s actions will increase their chances of success (e.g. lobbying or voting for a piece of legislation’s effects on its chances of passing).16  This author would suggest that Barry is slightly selling short the depths of his ideas by boiling them down to the success = luck + decisiveness formula. Barry suggests that power must be distinguished from this notion of decisiveness. While decisiveness refers to a proportion of success given action, power is better understood, according to Barry, as a committee member’s “ability to overcome resistance.”17 While Barry does not apply this directly to the formula previously suggested, it does have some bearing on his logic. If a committee member’s ability to overcome resistance is zero (e.g. they are absent from the committee due to illness and have no means of voting remotely), regardless of their decisiveness they will be relying solely on luck. Simultaneously, one’s ability to overcome resistance can be understood as proportional to some capacity; if a committee member is able to overcome resistance 85 times but fails to overcome  13 Brian Barry, “Is It Better to be Powerful or Lucky? Part 2,” Political Studies 28, no. 3 (1980): 338. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid. 16 Ibid. 17 Barry, 348. 8  that same resistance 15 times, their potential to be decisive in the latter 15 cases is effectively zero and measured at their ‘proportion of adventitious successes’ in the event of action in the other 85 cases. How, then, does power interact with the success = luck + decisiveness formula? Barry’s definition of power can be understood to act as a multiplier in the original formula for decisiveness and the formula presented to represent his work can be better defined as such: success = luck + decisiveness*power. Why is this useful in examining the relationship between economic recovery and policy? Take the exact cases presented for this thesis as an example. In the context of the euro area at the national level, there are several shared aspects of luck: monetary policy for all countries is set by the same supranational body in the form of the European Central Bank; the European Commission and other supranational organizations in charge of economic policy coordination may have different protocol or agenda items in place at any given time that may be beneficial or non-beneficial to some member states; the domestic political considerations of powerful, ‘core’ European Union member states may also impact one’s chances of success; etc.. These can all be coded as ‘luck’ in that peripheral member states of the euro area have little-to-no ability to affect the circumstances of these variables. There are some things over which countries like Ireland, Portugal and Greece are decisive. Fiscal policy and banking policy are still largely made at the member state level in the European Union meaning that member states themselves can have some hand in staging an economic recovery. This is not to say that all policies have the same level of decisiveness; the level of decisiveness of any given policy would be considered the proportion of cases in which that policy leads to economic benefit (e.g. renewed bond market confidence, reduced unemployment, increased growth, etc.). 9  As for power, this author would suggest that the size and proportion of the governing party (or governing coalition)’s bloc, formal or informal on the basis of ideology, within the national parliamentary system is a key aspect of considering a government’s ability to overcome resistance. If your government holds under 50 percent of the seats in the parliamentary body and cannot convince a majority to implement policy, the government’s decisiveness effectively is diminished to zero given their inability to implement preferred policies; on the other hand, if the government has a strong majority within the parliamentary system, it is quite likely that policies leading to success (or not) can be implemented. Table 1 serves as a list of possible variables belonging to the three categories. Table 1.

According to Perry Anderson in The New Old World, some of these included the following: Jean Monnet, the French diplomat commonly considered one of the most influential figures in the founding of what would become the European Union, wanted to create a source of peace in Europe which would prevent the continent from breaking out into continent-wide wars that had been so devastating over the previous half century and thought economic and political integration might prevent such violence; the United States had an interest in European integration as it was increasingly concerned about the influence of the Soviet Union over Eastern Europe and wanted to create an Atlantic-centric alliance to contain the spread of that influence; France and West Germany, coming out of intense conflict with each other, had strategic and economic interests in balancing against one another.18 All of these factors played important roles in founding the basis of Europe’s common currency, the euro.  Europe’s integration was not just the product of geopolitical thought but also of economic thought and the basis of the monetary and fiscal policy executed by national and supranational governments in the European Union today can be found in the competing economic philosophies of France and West Germany. West Germany tended to prefer ordoliberalism as the basis of its monetary and fiscal policy; that is, a system in which rules are formulated in general terms and the state’s actions would ideally be limited to the enforcement of those rules while generally allowing unregulated free market activity.19 As West German (given reunification with the East toward the end of the century, eventually just German) economic philosophy developed over the  18 Perry Anderson, The New Old World, (London: Verso, 2009), 21. 19 Markus K. Brunnermeier, Harold James and Jean-Pierre Landau, The Euro and the Battle of Ideas, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2016), 61. 11  next several decades, other beliefs developed leading intellectuals toward  that lender of last resort activity, taken by central banks during times of economic crisis, could lead to a corruption of monetary policy and that crisis should be handled with a focus on structural reforms and austerity policies.20 French economic philosophy takes on a different stance toward rules; rules, according to the French philosophy, should be subject to the political process and possible renegotiation during times of crisis; additionally, unlike the German position, French intellectuals viewed austerity quite critically and monetary policy should be at least somewhat focused on increasing growth.21 In short, the German position centers around a ‘smart money’ approach to monetary policy prioritizing anti-inflation and balanced budget policy proposals, while the French position can be seen as a looser position more attuned to economic growth and crisis management.  Officially sanctioned motion toward a European monetary union started with a summit at the Hague in 1969 where heads of state in the predecessor to the European Union, the European Economic Community (EEC), called for the “full liberalization of capital movements, the total convertability of Member States’ currencies, and the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates.”22 By 1972, the collapse of the Bretton Woods’ system with US President Nixon’s decision to take the dollar off the gold standard led to an immediate need to stabilize exchange rates within the EEC; the so-called ‘snake in the tunnel’ mechanism was developed to manage the floating of European currencies within “narrow margins of fluctuation against the dollar” was briefly successful but challenging to maintain due to global economic turbulence during the mid-1970s.23 The  20 Brunnermeier et al., 66-67. 21 Brunnermeier et al., 74. 22 Quoted from European Parliament; “History of economic and monetary union,” Fact Sheets on the European Union, European Parliament, <https://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/en/sheet/79/history-of-economic-and-monetary-union>. 23 Quoted from European Parliament. Ibid. 12  European Monetary System, created six years later to fulfill the same goal of exchange rate stability, weighted the currencies of all Member States aside from the United Kingdom against a constructed ‘European Currency Unit’ (ECU).24 Bilateral rates (i.e. exchange rates between any two Member States) was calculated based on rates against the ECU and fluctuations “had to be contained within a margin of 2.25 percent on either side of the bilateral rates” for most Member States.25 The EMU was much more successful than the ‘snake in the tunnel’ as a first pass at controlling European monetary policy in that it was able to stabilize exchange rate variability.26  From the late 1980s to the early 1990s, many developments took place which accelerated the pace of monetary integration. The Single European Act and Jacques Delors’ tenure as President of the European Commission provided the foreground to provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty formally established protocol for the introduction of a single currency for much of the European Union approximately ten years later.27 The euro, now used as official currency by 19 of the 27 Member States of the EU, allowed for complete coherence on issues of monetary policy and the setting of universal interest rates for borrowing across the Union; however, fiscal policy was largely still in the hands of Member States, causing some commentators to question whether the Union was ready for economic integration of this type.28  Furthermore, the representation of German economic philosophy at the supranational level was quite clear through the adoption of the single currency.  The single official primary mandate given to the European Central Bank, the institution managing the euro, was to maintain price stability through low inflation.29 The ability of member states to use monetary policy to  24 Ibid. 25 Ibid. 26 Ibid. 27 Ibid. 28 Anderson, 33. 29 “Objective of monetary policy,” European Central Bank, <https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/intro/objective/html/index.en.html>. 13  counter trends like rising unemployment was now only available at the supranational level. Another clear instance of clear ordoliberal economic reasoning was evident in the adoption of Article 125 of the Maastricht Treaty – an effective ban on direct bailouts or rescue funds shared between individual Member States and a ban on the ECB directly buying government debt.30 While other Member States saw this as a relatively unimportant rule with some flexibility, Germany saw this rule as quite important.31 The rule can be interpreted as yet more representation of German-style ordoliberalism in the economic structure of the European Union; without the ability to pursue expansionary monetary policy on one’s own or seek direct cash-based help from other Member States or the ECB alone, expansionary fiscal policies might saddle the country with an unsustainable deficit and debt. Thus, the probability of taking on an austerity-based solution, amenable to the German economic philosophy, in this set of limited options is relatively high. Crisis Management  During the first several years of the euro as the main currency across much of the European Union, positive economic growth associated with lowered borrowing costs for many peripheral euro area countries and the increased flow of capital around the EU was a trend seen generally throughout the supranational polity; while some Member States experienced significantly faster rates of growth than others, the outlook was generally quite positive for most of the 2000s.32 However, economic contagion from the housing market crisis in the United States led to a sustained period of economic downturn within the euro area, particularly affecting states in the periphery such as Ireland, Greece and Portugal. Germany expected that measures such as  30 Brunnermeier et al., 98. 31 Ibid. 32 David Sondermann et al., “Economic structures 20 years into the euro,” European Central Bank Occasional Paper Series no. 224 (June 2019): 10, <https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecb.op224~2349417aaa.en.pdf>.. 14  Article 125, the ban on direct bailouts granted to Member States by other countries in the euro area or by the European Central Bank, would be strictly enforced;33 this provoked something of an ideological battle among European heads of state about whether to adapt a French or German style of crisis response. As described in detail in the country-level sections of this paper on Ireland, Greece and Portugal, bailouts to countries dealing with unsustainable economic crises were eventually managed by the European Central Bank and European Commission with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, collectively the ‘troika.’ While these bailouts sound in line with French economic philosophy, they were conditioned on the imposition of often harsh austerity policies aimed at restoring the confidence of international investors at the expense of growth and employment, a concession to more ordoliberal-minded thinkers.  One key moment in what Brunnermeier et al. call the ‘battle of ideas’ occurred at a summit between German and French leaders at Deauville in October 2010. The countries, led by Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy respectively, set forth an agreement that future troika bailouts would involve some level of private sector involvement – the taking on of some costs or losses by private creditors.34 According to Brunnermeier et al., this led to some uncertainty among investors who feared this agreement would increase the probability of default among countries undergoing crisis; borrowing costs skyrocketed for many of countries in rough economic states and pressure mounted to preemptively implement austerity policies in the economic-philosophical interest of Germany.35 According to the trio of authors, this was a decisive moment in the handling of the crisis that cemented control firmly with German interests.36  33 Brunnermeier et al., 99. 34 Brunnermeier et al., 29. 35 Brunnermeier et al., 29-31 36 Ibid. 15   During the rest of the 2010s and the beginning of 2020, the European Central Bank itself took on measures related to monetary policy to ease liquidity conditions across the euro area. The European Central Bank has not raised interest rates since July 2011 and, in fact, with multiple instances of decisions to lower interest rates, has held a negative interest rate since June 2014.37 In 2015, the European Union decided to pursue quantitative easing (QE), a monetary policy in which a central bank makes targeted purchases of government bonds and other financial assets in order to directly add money into the economy. QE performed by the European Central Bank between 2015 and 2018 will be discussed in greater detail in the country-specific sections presented in this paper. In September 2019, the ECB decided to resume QE programs; the current global COVID-19 pandemic, seen by many central banks around the world as a prelude to another economic crisis, prompted the European Central Bank to expand greatly ongoing asset purchasing through QE.38  This understanding of the EU and ECB’s response to crisis is vital in assessing the luck aspect of this thesis’s Barry-influenced model. For a better look at power, one must turn to discussion of the member states themselves. In this thesis, Greece, Portugal and Ireland will be examined. Recent Political/Economic History and Crises at the National Level Greece  Perhaps the most infamous case to be examined for the purpose of this thesis, Greece may serve as an example of ineffective response to crisis at both the national and supranational levels. The late 2000s crisis battered Greece and recovery from the crisis has been remarkably  37 “Key ECB interest rates,” European Central Bank, accessed April 2020. <https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/key_ecb_interest_rates/html/index.en.html>. 38 Martin Arnold, “ECB’s Draghi ignored in-house advice on decision to restart QE,” Financial Times, October 10, 2019, <https://www.ft.com/content/de4a958a-eab3-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55>; Larry Elliott, “ECB U-turn shows it fears coronavirus could destroy eurozone project,” The Guardian, March 19, 2020, <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/ecb-u-turn-shows-it-fears-coronavirus-could-destroy-eurozone-project>. 16  slow for the country; Greek unemployment at the end of 2019 stood at nearly twice pre-crisis levels of unemployment and more than twice that of the euro area as a whole.39  While Greece is the most complicated case of the three at hand for this thesis in that the country’s economic woes are in many senses significantly less resolved than those of Ireland and Portugal, its crisis provides a clear lens through which the background to the actions of the ‘troika,’ the collaborative venture between the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund effectively to provide bailouts in exchange for austerity can be seen. In order to understand Greece’s economic downturn and, therefore, the nature of the economic crisis across Europe it may help to understand more broadly the modern history of Greek democracy. Before the Eurozone   On July 23, 1974, a military junta which had instituted authoritarian control over Greece for more than seven years collapsed following growing divisions within the government and military establishment over the Turkish invasion of North Cyprus.40 Former Conservative Prime Minister, Constantine Karamanlis, shortly thereafter took over as Prime Minister under the leadership of a new political party, New Democracy.41 Greece underwent several constitutional reforms over the following seven years under Karamanlis’s rule, culminating in the admission of Greece to the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1981.42  Greece’s entry into the EEC was happening at a unique moment in European history; while European integration had been an active project for over three decades, US President  39 See Eurostat, “Unemployment.” 40 “Greece’s Debt: 1974-2018,” Council on Foreign Relations, accessed February 18, 2020, <https://www.cfr.org/timeline/greeces-debt-crisis-timeline>. 41 “BBC ON THIS DAY: July 23, 1974: Greek military rule gives in to democracy,” BBC News, accessed February 18, 2020, <http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/23/newsid_2515000/2515819.stm>. 42 Ibid. 17  Nixon’s abandonment of the Bretton Woods gold standard dollar peg in 1971 had disrupted the normal business in trade in an increasingly integrated Europe. The requirements and the economic experiences of those under the European Monetary System, previously described in the section describing the economic history of the euro, would greatly affect future entrants into closer economic integration like Greece.43 During the 1980s, meeting the conditions for remaining within the EMS was no easy task for Greece; Greek GDP steadily fell during the first half of the decade.44  After the Maastricht Treaty and the agreement of conditions for the establishment of the euro, Greece was just eking “out primary surpluses.”45 According to Tooze, however, debts were piling up as political control swayed between the previously mentioned center-right New Democracy party and the social-democratic PASOK party; “huge stocks of debt” were accumulated in this time as the parties aimed at bringing Greece to modernity.46 Between 1980 and 1993, the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 20.8 percent to 91.2 percent.47 By 2000, on the eve of its eurozone membership, Greek public debt reached 104 percent of GDP, breaching the Stability and Growth Pact’s (SGP) upper limit of 60 percent on this figure.48   In short, the roots of later Greek fiscal woes were taking their place prior to and on the eve of eurozone accession.

As previously stated, the Greek government was able to maintain primary surpluses while foreign borrowing allowed for modernizing Greek infrastructure and institutions. This meant that while foreign borrowing took place, a fairly significant amount of tax revenue was being collected. In 2001, as borrowing costs and service charges fell with accession to the euro area, it could have been an opportunity to use tax revenues to pay off accumulated debt; instead, the Greek government decided to relax tax collection altogether.49 Between 2000 and 2003, the Greek deficit also went beyond SGP limits of 3 percent of GDP and reached more than 5.3 percent of GDP given heavier-than-expected costs for the Athens Olympics in 2004.50  Overall, during the period leading from accession to the crisis, it is not the level of debt which stands out but the lack of tax revenue and deficit. Contrary to popular belief and expectation given lower borrowing costs, the rate of Greek public borrowing did not increase significantly after euro area accession. In fact, in 2006, the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio was marginally lower than it had been than in 2001.51 Greece accounted for less than 2 percent of cross-border funding in the euro area prior to the crisis.52 However, the level of debt-to-GDP was still quite high and this was being added onto an entirely deficient tax revenue program. Not only were Greek taxes low in theory, in practice they were not being paid at particularly high rates. Across this period, Greece had the highest percentage of self-employed workers of any European  49 Ibid. 50 “Greece’s Olympic bill doubles,” BBC News, November 12, 2004, <http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4007429.stm>. 51 Tooze, 324. 52 Tooze, 107. 19  country – 35.1 percent -- and many ‘professionals’ in this sector “declared incomes that placed them consistently below the taxation threshold.”53  In 2007 and 2008, as the housing crisis in the United States started to spread across the Atlantic to European financial centers, it actually seemed as if Greece might have been immune from the worst effects of financial uncertainty; these hopes were, of course, dashed in light of questions about the level of debt and deficit. Greek exports and tourism slumped, certainly, but this was not unexpected or unusual.54 In fact, at the time of this slump, Greek banks attracted considerable deposit flows, peaking just months before the onset of the Greek crisis, given their lack of direct exposure to the American housing market security crisis.55 There were also, however, several questions about the level of Greek government debt and deficit; sovereign bond yields between Greece and Germany (i.e., the “premium investors demand to buy Greek government debt rather than German benchmarks”) skyrocketed from 2008 to 2009.56 The debt, as previously described, was indeed staggering and the deficit, according to communications between Athens and the Eurogroup, appeared to be heading toward above 10 percent of GDP in July of 2009.57 The Onset of the Crisis and Austerity/Papandreou and Trichet: October 2009 – November 2011  On October 4, 2009, George Papandreou’s PASOK won the most seats in the Greek legislative elections, allowing for a PASOK majority government under his leadership.58 Papandreou was immediately faced with a looming public debt and deficit crisis which had remained unaddressed by his New Democracy predecessor, Kostas Karamanlis. Two weeks after  53 Stathis Kalyvas, Modern Greece: What Everyone Needs to Know (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 162. 54 Tooze, 323. 55 Kalyvas, 155. 56 Kalyvas, 155-56. 57 Tooze, 324. 58 Helena Smith, “Greek socialists claim victory in election,” The Guardian, October 4, 2009, <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/04/greece-election-pasok-party>. 20  the election, Papandreou’s government alerted Eurostat that the Greek deficit would exceed 12.7 percent of GDP and subsequent budget revisions increased the Greek debt burden from 99 percent to 115 percent of GDP.59 The size of the deficit was shock to many given previously reported data from Greece; a European Commission report released in January would find that Greece’s financial figures were “so unreliable” and falsified that the deficit and debt might be even higher.60 Indeed, Eurostat would later update its 2009 estimates of the Greek deficit and debt to 15.4 percent of GDP and 126.8 percent of GDP respectively.61 By the end of 2009, €293 billion in Greek public debt was outstanding with €206 billion being foreign-owned debt and €90 billion being owned specifically by European banks.62  In early 2010, the EU’s leading institutions and de facto leading countries (France and Germany) were already taking sides in what was shaping up to be a deeply ideological battle over the fate of Greek debt. Looming over the EU was a May 19th deadline when Athens was due to make payments of €8.9 billion to creditors.63 French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Commission were in favor of mobilizing funds to bail out the Greek state and were opposed broadly to debt restructuring.64 This position can perhaps be explained by the state of French banks at the time; already in a fragile position, two of France’s most significant banks, BNP Paribas and Dexia, were holding significant amounts of Greek debt.65 For the French economy (or at least for the sake of French banks), haircuts (losses investors might incur if debt were restructured) might have been very detrimental.  59 Ibid. 60 Tony Barber, “Greece condemned for falsifying data,” Financial Times, January 12, 2010, < https://www.ft.com/content/33b0a48c-ff7e-11de-8f53-00144feabdc0>. 61 Helena Smith, “Greek deficit much bigger than estimate,” The Guardian, November 5, 2010, < https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/nov/15/greek-deficit-bigger-than-thought>. 62 Tooze, 325. 63 Tooze, 335. 64 Tooze, 325 65 Tooze, 326. 21   On February 11, 2010, however, Germany announced that they would support any emergency funds taken to support the euro but veto any specific offer of help to Greece.66 This was twofold; first, Germany was legally opposed to bailout out the Greek’s directly as Article 125 of the Maastricht Treaty seems to rule out any such direct financial funding of ailing EU member-states by other EU member-states; second, developing German public opinion was in opposition to mutual responsibility for debt.67 This opinion developed consistently in Germany; a January 2012 Eurobarometer questionnaire on debt pooling found that 71 percent of Germans believed that such proposals would benefit only those in the worst difficulties, 74 percent believed that it would penalize those not in difficulty and only 35 percent believed it would reduce the cost of crisis; these answers were fairly significantly higher, higher and lower respectively than the average across the EU.68  This is not to suggest that official statements by German officials were uniform in this strictly anti-bailout sentiment. German Minister of Finance Wolfgang Schäuble proposed in Spring of 2010 a European Monetary Fund for the explicit task of bailing out member-states like Greece; Angela Merkel publicly denied the viability of the scheme, calling instead for IMF involvement in the Greek crisis.69 While Merkel’s plea for IMF involvement eventually won out, some, Schäuble included, felt that IMF involvement would be deeply embarrassing for Europe.70 Eventually, despite pan-European concerns about the optics of IMF involvement, the European Troika, composed of the IMF, European Commission and ECB was initiated on March 25, 2010; after this point, it is made clear that the path forward would be support conditioned on  66 Tooze, 329. 67 Tooze, 329-330. 68 “Eurobarometer 76.1: Crisis,” European Parliament, January 2012, <https://europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/files/be-heard/eurobarometer/2011/europeans-and-the-crisis-iv/aggregate-report/en-aggregate-report-europeans-and-the-crisis-iv-201201.pdf>, 78. 69 Tooze, 332. 70 Tooze, 333. 22  implementing massive structural reform within Greece in the form of austerity and support granted only in cases when Greece was at risk of completely losing access to international markets.71  It did not take particularly long for such an event to occur. On April 22, 2010, given the dire state of the debt and deficit in Greece, Fitch Ratings downgraded Greece’s creditworthiness, effectively shutting it out of the international bond market.72 Five days later, the Greek government formally requested Troika assistance.73 Meanwhile, the situation across Europe particularly within banks exposed to Greek debt was decaying rapidly; Tooze described interbank lending as essentially at a complete standstill during this period.74  By early May, a deal for support from the Troika was reached with approval by both the Greek and, given their significant amount of sway over the proceedings, German parliaments. Greece, as part of the ‘Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies’ package agreed to deliver a turnaround in its budget balance of 18 percent of GDP and reduce its deficit by 7.5 percent GDP in 2010 in exchange for €110 billion from the Troika.75 76 The ECB also launched the so-called Securities Market Programme, an initiative to buy and sell government bonds in order to ease market conditions.77  The reception to these measures in Greece was initially mixed; over 50 percent of respondents in a poll of Greek citizens said they would prefer these programs over a default but the same programs resulted in a general strike from Greek workers during and following Troika  71 Tooze, 336-337. 72 Tooze, 338. 73 Kalyvas 158. 74 Tooze, 339. 75 Tooze, 340 76 Kalyvas, 171. 77 Krista Hughes and Sven Egenter, “UPDATE 2-ECB to buy euro zone govt bonds to fight crisis,” Reuters, May 10, 2010, <https://www.reuters.com/article/eu-greece-ecb/update-2-ecb-to-buy-euro-zone-govt-bonds-to-fight-crisis-idUSLDE64905120100510>. 23  deliberations.78 79 Eventually, the position of Greek workers in opposition to austerity gained the upper hand in the balance of Greek public opinion; the years to come would be characterized by mass public demonstrations against Troika involvement in the Greek economy and austerity more generally. By early 2011, despite the toughness of these austerity measures and the size of aid packages, the conditions in Greece did not appear to be getting very much better. The ECB at one point owned 15 percent of Greek public debt and, with rising inflation threatening the German economy, Jean-Claude Trichet decided that something needed to change.80 The ECB, in the midst of the crisis, raised interest rates, severely restricting credit conditions within the euro area.81 Over the next few weeks, the Greek sovereign bond yield spread as opposed to the rest of the eurozone reached 1200 points, showing how risky international investors felt Greek bonds were at the time (and, therefore, how unconfident they were in the ability of Greece to solve its debt crisis).82 In June, the US and Germany called for more debt restructuring which would be pushed through in yet another austerity package in the Hellenic Parliament later in the month; an IMF assessment published in July detailing the likely effects of the package concluded that it would not be nearly enough to address the scale of the crisis in Greece.83 Later that month, France and Germany agreed to yet another provision of funds and an expansion of the EFSF bond market stabilization funds.84 In October, yet another plan was drafted involving debt restructuring seeing banks take haircuts of tens of billions of euros, more than 100 percent of Greek GDP in troika  78 Tooze, 340 79 Kalyvas, 172 80 Tooze, 378. 81 Ibid. 82 Tooze, 379. 83 Tooze, 384-5. 84 Tooze, 388. 24  funds and, once more, more austerity.85 With Greek unemployment at 19.7 percent, up from 8 percent before the onset of the crisis, Papandreou decided that enough had been enough and he would call a public referendum on whether to continue the Troika programs.86 At a G20 meeting in early November, however, it was made clear to Papandreou with pressure from Merkel and Sarkozy that the only referendum they would accept the results of without repercussion was whether Greece would remain in the euro area.87 This lack of agency amidst the already high-pitched political discontent in Greece led to his fairly swift replacement by Lucas Papademos, a former vice president from the ECB, under a new national unity party.88 Coincidentally, Mario Draghi took over as President of the ECB about a week before this political shift in Greece, ending Jean-Claude Trichet’s tenure and leading to questions about what was in store for Greece and the Troika. Papademos/Samaris, Draghi and Stagnation: 2012-January 2015  Despite Papademos’s leadership under a ‘unity’ party, Greece was anything but unified. Perhaps signifying helplessness among the Greek public and weariness over austerity being tried over and over again to little change for the better, several significant movements had begun to arise in opposition to the two major parties, PASOK and New Democracy. On the left was Syriza, a “radical alternative to PASOK” under the leadership of Alexis Tsipras; and on the right was Golden Dawn, a neofascist movement which, in Crashed, Tooze likened to the original Nazi movement in Germany, writing that both involved “a comprehensive social and economic crisis [providing] the setting for a program of a national racial community.”89  85 Tooze, 408. 86 Tooze, 409. 87 Ibid. 88 Tooze, 410. 89 Tooze, 375-6. 25  Both of these radical parties made major gains in the May 2012 Greek legislative election while both New Democracy and PASOK lost ground from the previous election in terms of vote count. After approximately one week of attempts to form a government with no success, another election was scheduled for June 17 in which the leftist Syriza party performed even more convincingly. Ultimately, the New Democracy party was able to form a government under Antonis Samaras under a coalition with PASOK and DIMAR, a small social-democratic party.90  Kalyvas noted that this political lack of clarity and extended election period “had significant repercussions” on the debt crisis, leading to a continued lack of progress in bringing Greece toward recovery.91 Overall, as debt structuring continued across 2012 (with private creditors conceding €107 billion), the actual reduction of debt was less than hoped for (19 percent).92 Even worse, planners at the supranational level had significant lapses in judgment over certain policies; one policy aimed at making Greek exports more competitive, wage reductions for the average Greek laborer, ended up moving the current account into surplus but only by contracting Greek imports; Greek exports remained stagnant, drawing a distinction between its experience and simultaneous experiences in countries like Ireland.93  90 Tooze, 435. 91 Kalyvas, 176. 92 Tooze, 426-7. 93 Kalyvas, 177. 26  Across 2013 and 2014, conditions further worsened. In July of 2013, the Greek parliament okayed another round of austerity measures as calls for a general strike increased across Greece.94 By 2014, Greek unemployment had reached 27 percent with the majority of young people out of work (Chart 3).95 Understandably, these conditions led to significant unrest and discontent with the Samaras premiership.  Quantitative Easing (QE), Syriza and a (Brief) Glimmer of Change  On January 22, 2015, Mario Draghi announced that the ECB would start a quantitative easing (QE) program of 60 billion euros a month, aiming to purchase government and corporate bonds  to stabilize the markets and increase the supply of money to investors; the hope was that such a program would stimulate the economy in ways similar to those experienced in the United States as it embarked on a similar program several years earlier.96 While the ECB had gone on bond-buying excursions before, none was quite as targeted as what QE was after.  That same week, Greek elections resulted in a change of government. Samaras was ousted in favor of a coalition between Syriza and ANEL, a nationalist conservative party with a eurosceptic world view. With Alexis Tsipras as the Prime Minister and Yanis Varoufakis, a new  94 Council on Foreign Relations, “Greece’s Debt.” 95 Tooze, 515; See Eurostat, “Unemployment.” 96 Ibid. 0.05.010.015.020.025.030.02006 January2006 July2007 January2007 July2008 January2008 July2009 January2009 July2010 January2010 July2011 January2011 July2012 January2012 July2013 January2013 July2014 January2014 July2015 January2015 July2016 January2016 July2017 January2017 July2018 January2018 July2019 January2019 JulyChart 3. Greek Unemployment Over the Period of Crisis 27  Finance Minister, there was some sense that the status quo might change with respect to austerity. Varoufakis, for instance, believed that Draghi’s turn to QE, if accepted unilaterally by Athens, would box Greece into accepting even more austerity and believed that if the new government were to have any grasp over debt negotiations, it would have to play a game in which it threatened possible financial contagion.97 Varoufakis’s game plan? To threaten to default on bonds present on the ECB’s balance sheet, making quantitative easing a huge red flag to conservative thinkers across the eurozone.98 This hardball plan did not result, however, in the expected result. By June, Varoufakis had been able to delay an offer of more austerity but was given an ultimatum on another bailout plan with more of the same.99 Syriza, elected to oppose such austerity, was put in the position to reject the offer and face potential expulsion from the eurozone (and perhaps, if legally mandated, the European Union); Tsipras called a popular referendum on the matter. 61 percent of Greek voters rejected the troika’s austerity proposal in a referendum on July 5; Tsipras, however, decided at the last minute to not abide by the results of the referendum and upon Varoufakis’s resignation accepted a plan with modest debt write-offs but continued austerity, scheduled to conclude in August of 2018.100  Ultimately, the state of things remained unstable in Greece over the next several years. In February 2017, the IMF warned that the Greek debt it had fought so hard to restructure in 2015 as part of the troika remained unsustainable and on “an explosive” path.101 10-year bond yields, a proxy for the Greek government’s borrowing costs from private creditors, had only just reached near pre-crisis levels, signaling something akin to economic recovery but without much  97 Tooze, 515. 98 Ibid. 99 Tooze, 528. 100 Tooze, 530-1. 101 Shawn Donnan, “IMF board split over bailout terms for Greece.” Financial Times, February 6, 2017. <https://www.ft.com/content/6756e4f6-ece6-11e6-930f-061b01e23655>. 28  resonance among the Greek public or within the international bond markets.102 While Greece was able to stage its first bond sale in three years later that year, half of those who bought bonds were already holders of existing Greek debt, suggesting ambivalence on behalf of investors unaffected thus far to invest in Greece.103 In 2018, the Greek government approved of extremely unpopular property reforms which allowed for the electronic auctioning off of foreclosed-upon properties; by April 12, 2018, an estimated 10 percent of the population had been affected by such auctions.104 The End of Austerity and What Remains/Conclusion  In August 2018, Greece’s long inclusion in the troika’s austerity-bailout program finally came to an end with European officials telling journalists that Greece could finally “turn the page” on the crisis.105 With unemployment in the country still at nearly twice what it was prior to the crisis, it was no surprise that Syriza’s years of leadership, less effective than many in the country had hoped for, had come to an end and New Democracy would lead the country forward with a decisive majority in the Hellenic Parliament.106 After years of failed government action against austerity and a misplaced submission to austerity, Greece’s attempts toward economic recovery more or less looked ineffectual.

On April 25, 1974, modern Portuguese democracy began with the ousting of the so-called Estado Novo regime. While it appeared at first to some in the West that Portugal’s new leadership would align with the Soviet Union because of the apparent strength of Portuguese Communists, the Socialist Party (PS) was brough to power by the electorate a year after the ousting of the dictatorship. The Socialist Party was a social-democratic party, a member of the Second International, along with the German SPD and the British Labour Party and was committed to what Daniel Finn calls “Atlantic normalcy.”107 This transition from authoritarianism to democracy provided the background for Portugal’s accession into the European Economic Community and its eventual membership in the European Union’s monetary union. Eurozone Accession/Before the Crisis  Portugal’s entry into the euro area in 1999 was relatively shaky compared to other member state experiences. At this juncture, traditionally strong Portuguese sectors were finding themselves increasingly unable to compete with new entrants to the global market like China and India. The end of the Multi Fiber Agreement in the mid-1990s led to a significant shift in the prioritization of sectors in the Portuguese economy; whereas textiles represented 33 percent of total Portuguese exports before the end of the Agreement, they only represented 13 percent of total exports by 2006.108   107 Daniel Finn, “Luso-Anomalies,” New Left Review vol. 106 (July/August 2017): 7, <https://newleftreview.org/issues/II106/articles/daniel-finn-luso-anomalies.pdf>. 108 Pedro Lourtie, “Understanding Portugal in the Context of the Euro Crisis,” in Resolving the European Debt Crisis, ed. W.R. Cline and G. Wolff (Washington, D.C.: PIIE, 2012), 5-6. <https://www.piie.com/publications/papers/lourtie20110913.pdf>. 30   Portugal had a somewhat underwhelming first decade as a euro area member-state at least compared to the spectacular performances of some smaller, Mediterranean euro area economies. While the Portuguese economy grew at a substantial rate overall, it was being outpaced substantially by other EU member-states. Portuguese GDP, as a percentage of the average EU GDP, fell from 75 percent in 2001 to 66% in 2008.109 By 2006, the average Portuguese worker was earning 60 percent of the wage given to their Spanish counterparts.110 While Portuguese net growth was undeniable, it was also not consistent. During 2003, a year of growth for Greece and Ireland of 5.9 percent and 4.4 percent respectively, Portugal registered negative growth of -0.9 percent, making it the only euro area country other than Germany to enter a recession during that year.111  This is not to say that Portugal’s entry into the euro area did not come with the benefits shared by other so-called ‘peripheral’ countries. Portugal experienced an influx of foreign capital as a result of its monetary integration with Europe similar to Ireland.112 One distinction was that investment was primarily occurring in non-tradable sectors rather than in, say, the real-estate sector as was the case in Ireland.113 This allowed for substantial structural reforms in Portugal all while government expenditure was consolidated. Total government expenditure decreased from 45.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to 43.6 percent of GDP in 2008, allowing for a deficit that stood at only 2.7 percent of GDP.114 Meanwhile, substantial investment was occurring in education, research and development and production focus and initiative was being shifted toward renewable energy sources.115 While Portugal’s current account deficit remained high by the end  109 Finn, 16.  110 Ibid. 111 Lourtie, 5. 112 Finn, 17. 113 Finn, 18 114 Lourtie, 14-15. 115 Lourtie, 8-10. 31  of the decade, the country’s export growth from 2006 to 2010 exceeded that of other peripheral countries.116 The Crisis  The end of the 2000s started, like Greece, far less dramatically than the following years might have suggested. While it was clear that the American subprime crisis was cascading into European markets, it appeared for some time that some of the more dramatic ripples of economic contagion would at least partially skip over Portugal. During the second half of 2009, 10-year Portuguese government bond yields decreased and the difference to German bonds was less than 100 basis points, a signal that investors saw the Portuguese economy as relatively stable.117  In November 2009, 10-year yields were at their lowest monthly showing since March 2006.118  This is not to say that the picture was wholly positive in Portugal; by the end of 2009, it was also clear that the Portuguese economy was in the midst of an economic recession with official figures projecting that the economy would contract by more than 3 percent during that year.119 Worsening economic conditions, even if not quite as dramatic as the hardest-hit European economies up to that point, explain the diminished performance in the 2009 legislative election of the incumbent Socialist Party; whereas the party had received 45.03 percent of the vote in the 2005 election, that plurality fell to 36.56 percent of the vote in 2009.120 121 José  116 Lourtie, 15, 17. 117 Lourtie, 18. 118 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, “Long-Term Government Bond Yields: 10-year: Main (Including Benchmark) for Portugal [IRLTLT01PTM156N],” accessed March 2020, distributed by FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IRLTLT01PTM156N>. 119 Peter Wise, “Portugal suffers another credit warning,” FT, October 29, 2009, <https://www.ft.com/content/62a0e4e6-c496-11de-912e-00144feab49a>. 120 “CNE Resultados Eleitorais – 20-02-2005,” Comissão Nacional de Eleições  accessed March 20, 2020, <http://eleicoes.cne.pt/raster/index.cfm?dia=20&mes=02&ano=2005&eleicao=ar>. 121 “CNE Resultados Eleitorais – 27-09-2009,” Comissão Nacional de Eleições  accessed March 20, 2020, <http://eleicoes.cne.pt/raster/index.cfm?dia=27&mes=09&ano=2009&eleicao=ar>. 32  Sócrates, the party’s leader, formed a minority government at the end of 2009, making him the leader of the country as Portugal’s economic woes accelerated dramatically.122  The economic recession Portugal had entered into in 2009 was clearly the most pressing issue that the incoming government under Sócrates would have to face but it was also clear that Portugal’s deficit and public debt were reaching unsustainable levels. Portuguese public debt reached 87.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and the deficit had reached 9.4 percent of GDP. The scale of the deficit had been expected to be much lower in earlier estimates, adding to pressing concerns over the sustainability of economic conditions within Portugal.123 124 Sócrates’ government, in response to brewing investor concerns and warnings from credit agencies about deteriorating sovereign debt conditions, revealed a budget proposal which would have reduced the deficit by 1 percent of GDP over the following year and to below 3 percent of GDP by 2013.125 However, growing investor fears during the first few months of 2010 over the unsustainability of debt in Greece had a contagious effect, fueling rising bond yields in Portugal.126 Additionally, the budget proposal faced significant opposition within Portugal from workers who objected to wage freezes and benefit cuts. To make matters worse, the National Statistics Institute (INE) in March revised growth estimates for 2009 downward leading some to question whether the austerity proposed would be enough.127 128 All in all, it seemed as if the  122 Wise, “Credit Warning.” 123 “Government deficit/surplus, debt and associated data,” Eurostat, last updated January
