The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been felt by the Indonesian people since the implementation of the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) on Digital Communication Management Bandung City Government in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery in Bandung City  Ekasari, Saktisyahputra, Ambulani, and Akib    134 | Ilomata International Journal of Management                    https://www.ilomata.org/index.php/ijjm  March 15, 2020. Community activities are forced to be carried out through digital transformation in services, transactions and work, for example the Bekasi City Government. The digitalization of media through the wide internet gateway is open to all people. Most of the world's population is connected to the internet. There are several research results that Indonesia ranks one to five as the country with the largest number of social media to the content that floods the digital medium. For institutions or organizations, it provides a kind of alternative for information dissemination, activation, public and business communication, as well as public relations and business activities for institutions. Digital media provides changes and even revolutions in the relationship between institutions and society. During this time, communication tends to be dominated by one-way and broadcast type, but now it has become interactivity. Institutions and audiences are entities (in internet language referred to as nodes) that are comparable, are in the same network, and can influence. For example, digital media constructs trust and sentiment through trending topics, viral, as well as issues discussed and stored (databases and archives) that can be accessed. The digital communication research trend is on the rise and is popular nowadays. This is evidenced by many researchers conducting research and publications in international journals discussing digital communication. Like,  (Permatasari, et al., 2021), (Minaeva, 2019), (Sarah M.L. Krøtel, 2019), (Agostino et al., 2020), (Zhou et al., 2020), (Charalambous, 2019), (Uitz, 2012), (Al-Ghafri et al., 2016), (Vaterlaus et al., 2022), (Salafia & Diplacido, 2022), (Sajane & Gaikwad, 2022), (Wilantika & Wibisono, 2021), (Akbar et al., 2021), (Ryanto Budiana et al., 2016), (Fajriyah et al., 2020), (Jernigan, 2020), (Isaac Kofi Nti; Adebayo Felix Adekoya; Michael Opoku; Peter Nimbe, 2020), (Enilda Romero-Hall; Erika Petersen; Renata Sindicic; Linlin Li, 2020), (Stephan Längle, 2019), (Martins, 2022), (Kenneth Nwanua Ohei, 2019), (Squires, 2022), (Orji-Egwu, A. O., Oyekele, A. S., Alike, N., & Sanita, 2019), (Permatasari et al., 2021), (Aboh & Ezeudo, 2020), (Charalambous, 2019), (Uitz, 2012), (Al-Ghafri et al., 2016), (Vaterlaus et al., 2022), (Minaeva, 2019), (Febriani et al., 2023), (Saktisyahputra et al., 2022)  discusses how the use and utilization of digital communication in various communication industries such as Public Relations, Advertising, Marketing Communication, Social Media and Broadcasting is happening around the world today. Based on the formulation of the problem above, the purpose of this study is to find out the Bandung City Government's Efforts in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery through Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities and Evaluation in Bandung City.    METHOD This study uses the method of Phenomenology of Edmund Husserl. Husserl asserted that not only research but philosophy of theory or philosophy of science. The method used to find out from his experience actually becomes the truth he experiences. Method is to be understood here not as a technique of research, but in the etymological sense of a means of access to a field of research, which is to say that those considerations belong to the theory or philosophy of science. Digital Communication Management Bandung City Government in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery in Bandung City  Ekasari, Saktisyahputra, Ambulani, and Akib    135 | Ilomata International Journal of Management                    https://www.ilomata.org/index.php/ijjm  According to Husserl, the method of achieving eidetic knowledge is knowledge of reality. So, intentionality or directness to objective knowledge is a formal goal. Intentionally, denoting the presentational and objectivating function of consciousness, more precisely, the fact that the same object appears in a variety of manners of presentation, is entirely due to apperceptive characters. Practicing the phenomenological method, the non-essential elements are reduced through epoche. By placing non-essential elements to consciousness to capture the meaning and understanding of reality. (Poespowardojo & Seran, 2016) Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process. Communication management can be defined as public relations activities and accompanying activities to run programs, campaigns, and projects (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021; Viola et al., 2021) In simple terms, planning can be grouped into four clusters of digital communication activities, namely promotion, conversion, strategy, content. Strategy The first activity is conducting market research. This is done by determining the target target, segmentation, target age, situation or demographics. The second activity carries out campaign goals (campaign goals). The third activity of the publication channel, this is done by analyzing social media, publication channels, types of content on social media. The fourth activity determines promotion channels. The fifth stage is to determine the main performance indicators (KPIs). Content Creating content by means of Keyword Analysis, something that is currently popular in the community.

Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results. (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021) The objects used as informants in this research are Mr. Nicodemus Risang Bayu Citra Saptadi as a Digital Communication Practitioner who lives at Gang Atma No.213 Blol 187 B Jl. West Maleber RT 06 RW 3 Maleber Village, Andir District, Bandung City, Mr. Adi Saputra as a Digital Communication Practitioner who lives in Bale Bumi Asri No. 16 Bandung and Mrs. Reni Diyah Permataningsih, residents of Bandung City. The total number of informants is three people. This informant is seen to represent what he wants to study and is selected based on the context that the researcher wants to discuss in this study. The results of the study were formulated in two main terms, namely the quality of the research instrument, and the quality of data collection. The quality of the research instrument is in accordance with the validity and reliability of the instrument and the quality of data collection is in accordance with the methods used to collect data. Data collection is done naturally (natural setting), in the laboratory with experimental methods, at home, seminar meetings, discussions, and others. The technique of collecting is done by questionnaire (questionnaire), observation (observation), interview (interview), and collaboration. (Sugiyono, 2021) Data analysis in qualitative research is carried out during data collection. Researchers conduct interviews, if the answers interviewed after being analyzed feel unsatisfactory, the researcher will continue the question until the stage of obtaining data that is considered credible. Miles & Huberman (1992) suggested that activities in qualitative data analysis were carried out interactively. Activities in data analysis are data reduction, data display, and data verification. Conclusions in qualitative research answer the problem formulation, maybe not. The conclusions of qualitative research are expected to get new findings that have never existed or complement existing findings. The findings are in the form of a description or description of the object of research. (Ronda, 2018).  RESULT AND DISCUSSION Researchers conducted interviews with key informant Mr. Nicodemus Risang Bayu Citra Saptadi as a 38 year old Digital Communication Practitioner who lives at Gang Atma No.213 Blol 187 B Jl. West Maleber RT 06 RW 3 Maleber Village, Andir District, Bandung City. Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process. Communication management can be defined as public relations activities and accompanying activities to run programs, campaigns, and projects (Nasrullah, 2021). The Bandung City Digital Communication Management Bandung City Government in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery in Bandung City  Ekasari, Saktisyahputra, Ambulani, and Akib    137 | Ilomata International Journal of Management                    https://www.ilomata.org/index.php/ijjm  Government's digital communication planning is quite good through a digital platform to help Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. Mr Nicodemus said that “…In my opinion, it's pretty good, because the digital platform is more helpful for small entrepreneurs, especially now focusing on Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. One of them is Digital Transformation by continuing to encourage the implementation of smart cities through digital transformation in various aspects of public services. Bearing the title as a pioneer of smart cities in Indonesia, the seriousness of the Bandung City Government in strengthening the supporting ornaments of smart cities has never stopped. Especially in pursuing digital transformation as an important pillar of the realization of Smart City Bandung. The motivation for the digital transformation of the City of Bandung has become even more after a pandemic storm because it is undeniable that the Covid-19 pandemic requires the implementation of several restrictions. It was solved through the go digital switch. Mayor of Bandung, Mr. Yana Mulyana, revealed that digital transformation is a necessity for the Bandung City Government. Not only as an implementation of the Smart City Bandung program but because of a commitment to providing convenience to the community. So far, the digital transformation of the city of Bandung has touched almost all aspects of service. In population services, for example, the City of Bandung has presented many digital services. Such as e-Space or a 24-hour online registration system, the KIA Pavilion (Children's Identity Card), the Gallery Room or the Mini Command Center which is a monitoring room for population services at the Population and Civil Registration Offices and Districts. Then there is e-PunTEN or Electronic Non-Permanent Resident Registration which is a breakthrough for population administration services in the form of an application. "Digital transformation in population services is also carried out through Salaman innovation, namely a breakthrough in online population administration services through the Bandung City Population and Civil Registration Service website,". "Including Youth, namely Mandiri Data Updating is a web and mobile-based application that is used to update population data independently," he added. The Mayor of Bandung added that the digital transformation of the City of Bandung also provides convenience for job seekers with the presence of the New BIMMA (Bandung Integrated Manpower Management Application) Application. BIMMA makes it easier for the community to take care of making AK-1 or Job Seeker Cards, training and apprenticeships, competency tests, as well as recording disputes and other services. The convenience of the citizens of Bandung City is also provided in fulfilling their tax obligations through the e-SATRiA innovation. This application facilitates taxpayers to pay their obligations without the need to come to the Regional Revenue Management Agency office. The successful innovation brought the City of Bandung into the Top 99 Public Service Innovations 2018. As a creative city that has many Micro, Small and Medium Business Actors, the City of Bandung also supports the growth of business actors by presenting the SIRKUIT application or the Integrated Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise Entrepreneurship Information System and Salapak. which is a place for offline and online product exhibitions. The commitment of the Bandung City Government in providing ease of service through digital transformation is certainly not just a slogan. "As evidence, there are around 75 innovations presented through regional device organizations Digital Communication Management Bandung City Government in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery in Bandung City  Ekasari, Saktisyahputra, Ambulani, and Akib    138 | Ilomata International Journal of Management                    https://www.ilomata.org/index.php/ijjm  (OPD) with most of them being digital-based," in harmony with the spirit of smart city implementation. The city of Bandung also continues to try to integrate all existing applications with the presence of Bandung Sadayana as a digital home for all applications. The presence of Bandung Sadayana also serves as a place for digital literacy and collaboration for the people of Bandung. The Bandung Sadayana innovation is also equipped with supporting features that are integrated with various government digital services, startups in the city of Bandung Bandung and other agencies such as population services, licensing, taxation, CCTV, PMI blood stock, PD Pasar food prices, open data, Covid-19 information. , JDIH, BPOM, tourism, LAPOR!, to Call Center 112. He added, the Bandung City Government also encourages economic acceleration through digital transactions by actively campaigning for the QRIS media. As a result, the Bandung City Government has succeeded in being ranked first as a regional government that implements electronic transactions in West Java. The first rank achievement was obtained from the digitalization process in transactions at the local government level…” Digital communication activities can be grouped into four clusters, namely strategy, content, promotion, and conversion  (Nasrullah, 2021). The Bandung City Government cooperates with the Daegu Digital Promotion Agency in helping the economic recovery of the citizens of the City of Bandung. Mr Nicodemus said that “…Since the beginning of the pandemic, businesses in Bandung began to turn into Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises so that the usual conventional forms of business transactions began to become digital, the Bandung City Government has helped more to increase skills in digital training and most recently is collaborating with Daegu Digital Promotion Agency, considering that the cities of Bandung and Daegu have similar demographics, I hope that this collaboration will further improve the economic recovery of the citizens of Bandung, since this is the first time I have seen the direct effects…” The institution's digital communication management will evaluate the performance that has been carried out. Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). Evaluation is currently still limited to socialization. Mr Nikodemus said that “…So far the evaluation may still be limited to socialization, considering that there are still areas that have not had full access, such as those in the suburbs, which have entered the district, but for municipalities as far as I can see and feel it is more pronounced because maybe many young people are already literate. technology compared to the more senior generation, many young entrepreneurs were helped but as I discussed earlier the majority of the culinary businesses were affected…” The researcher also conducted interviews with the informant Mr. Adi Saputra as a 35 year old Digital Communication Practitioner who lives in Bale Bumi Asri No. 16 Bandung. Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process.

The Bandung City Government's Digital Communication Planning is still less than optimal. Mr Adi said that “…Not so optimal, because there is no single agency/department that is concerned with digital massiveness efforts in an effort to recover the economy. If someone integrates the parties in one big digitalization movement, the impact on the economic recovery will be greatly felt…” Digital communication activities can be grouped into four clusters, namely strategy, content, promotion, and conversion (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). The Bandung City Government has not been massive and inclusive in making several efforts. Mr Adi said that “…the Bandung City Government has made several efforts but they are not yet massive and inclusive, they need to be further improved…” The institution's digital communication management will evaluate the performance that has been carried out. Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). The evaluation of the Bandung City Government's digital communication still needs to be improved. Mr Adi said that “…The Bandung City Government's digital communication evaluation still needs to be improved, because there is still a lack of participation from other parties, both in planning and implementing digital communications…” The researcher also conducted interviews with the informant Mrs. Reni Diyah Permataningsih is 60 years old as a resident of Bandung City. Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process. Communication management can be defined as public relations activities and accompanying activities to run programs, campaigns, and projects (Kirk Hallahan in Heath, 2013: 153) (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021).  The Bandung City Government's Digital Communication Planning has seen a better impact on economic recovery in the City of Bandung. Mrs. Renny said that “…Honestly, when I was younger, I was a contractor for the Bandung City Government so that I memorized every corner of the Bandung City Government room. I think that the Bandung City Government Digital Communication Planning currently looks better for the economic recovery in Bandung City with everyone's digital communication. can quickly absorb information or whatever…” The institution's digital communication management will evaluate the performance that has been carried out. Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). Evaluation of digital communication is that we must always be updated and up-to-date for any developments including digital communication. Mrs. Renny said that Digital Communication Management Bandung City Government in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery in Bandung City  Ekasari, Saktisyahputra, Ambulani, and Akib    140 | Ilomata International Journal of Management                    https://www.ilomata.org/index.php/ijjm  “…I have stated above that I do not follow digital communication in Bandung City Government, but basically we must always be updated and up-to-date for any developments including digital communication…”  CONCLUSION  Based on the Data Findings, Data Results and Discussions that the researchers have conveyed, it can be concluded that the Bekasi City Government has implemented Digital Communication Management both from Planning, Activities and Evaluation in helping an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery in Bekasi City.

The evaluation of digital communication so far is still limited to socialization, considering that there are still areas that have not yet received full access, such as in suburban areas, they have entered the Regency area. The researcher recommends that the Bandung City Government can create an agency / service that focuses on socializing digital literacy in an effort to recover the economy. The two Bandung City Governments help provide subsidies to the community to take part in the certification of the National Professional Certification Agency of the Republic of Indonesia (BNSP RI) for the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Assistance scheme to help improve the competence of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Facilitators and help increase the turnover and profit of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises actors. , Small and Medium Enterprises which are fostered by Micro, Small and Medium Business Facilitators.
