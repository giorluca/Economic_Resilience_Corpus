With a few exceptions, most studies on tropospheric ozone (O3) variability during and followingthe COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) economic downturn focused on high-emission regions or urban envi-ronments. In this work, we investigated the impact of the societal restriction measures during the COVID-19pandemic on surface O3 at several high-elevation sites across North America and western Europe. Monthly O3anomalies were calculated for 2020 and 2021, with respect to the baseline period 2000–2019, to explore theimpact of the economic downturn initiated in 2020 and its recovery in 2021. In total, 41 high-elevation siteswere analyzed: 5 rural or mountaintop stations in western Europe, 19 rural sites in the western US, 4 sites inthe western US downwind of highly polluted source regions, and 4 rural sites in the eastern US, plus 9 moun-taintop or high-elevation sites outside Europe and the United States to provide a “global” reference. In 2020,the European high-elevation sites showed persistent negative surface O3 anomalies during spring (March–May,i.e., MAM) and summer (June–August, i.e., JJA), except for April. The pattern was similar in 2021, except forJune. The rural sites in the western US showed similar behavior, with negative anomalies in MAM and JJA 2020(except for August) and MAM 2021. The JJA 2021 seasonal mean was influenced by strong positive anomaliesin July due to large and widespread wildfires across the western US. The polluted sites in the western US showednegative O3 anomalies during MAM 2020 and a slight recovery in 2021, resulting in a positive mean anomalyfor MAM 2021 and a pronounced month-to-month variability in JJA 2021 anomalies. The eastern US sites werealso characterized by below-mean O3 for both MAM and JJA 2020, while in 2021 the negative values exhibitedPublished by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union.15694 D. Putero et al.: Fingerprints of COVID-19 economic downturn on ozone anomaliesan opposite structure compared to the western US sites, which were influenced by wildfires. Concerning the restof the world, a global picture could not be drawn, as the sites, spanning a range of different environments, did notshow consistent anomalies, with a few sites not experiencing any notable variation. Moreover, we also comparedour surface anomalies to the variability of mid-tropospheric O3 detected by the IASI (Infrared AtmosphericSounding Interferometer) satellite instrument. Negative anomalies were observed by IASI, consistent with pub-lished satellite and modeling studies, suggesting that the anomalies can be largely attributed to the reduction ofO3 precursor emissions in 2020.1 IntroductionTropospheric ozone (hereafter simply referred to as O3) is ashort-lived climate forcer (Szopa et al., 2021) that plays a keyrole in the climate system. It is one of the most powerful an-thropogenic greenhouse gases (the third most important, aftercarbon dioxide and methane), and it also impacts the lifetimeof methane, which is one of the O3 precursors (Monks et al.,2015; Gulev et al., 2021). Moreover, at the surface it also hasadverse effects on ecosystems, crop productivity, and humanhealth (Fleming et al., 2018; Mills et al., 2018).The COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) pandemicemerged in late 2019 and initiated a global economic down-turn in 2020, which was characterized by a drastic reductionof emissions related to several sectors, such as private trans-portation and both domestic and international aviation (e.g.,Le Quéré et al., 2020; Friedlingstein et al., 2022). The reduc-tion of emissions turned into a reduction of air pollutants thatcan directly be related to O3 variability due to its photochem-ical formation from O3 precursors, such as nitrogen oxides(NO and NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and non-methanevolatile organic compounds (NM-VOCs).Several studies in the past few years have investigated theimpact of the COVID-19 economic downturn on O3 concen-trations and variability at global, regional, and local scales(Gkatzelis et al., 2021; Sokhi et al., 2021). However, mostof these works focused on high-emission sources or urbanenvironments (Sicard et al., 2020; Adam et al., 2021; Chos-sière et al., 2021; Keller et al., 2021). A number of studiesindicated varying O3 behavior as a function of the reductionin the emissions, mainly dependent on whether the photo-chemical O3 formation in the considered regions was NOx-or VOC-limited (Gaubert et al., 2021; Matthias et al., 2021;Mertens et al., 2021; Cuesta et al., 2022).Concerning free-tropospheric values, which could be con-sidered representative of background atmospheric condi-tions, Steinbrecht et al. (2021) reported a reduction of O3of 7 % (∼ 4 ppb) from April to August 2020 in the 1–8 kmaltitude region of northern midlatitudes with respect to the2000–2020 climatological mean. Cristofanelli et al. (2021)observed reductions in the 2020 monthly mean O3 values(with respect to a 25-year climatological mean) at a moun-taintop site in Italy. Other studies have indicated the presenceof negative O3 anomalies in the free troposphere in 2020,mainly as a consequence of emissions reductions (Bouararet al., 2021; Clark et al., 2021; Miyazaki et al., 2021). Changet al. (2022) determined that the free-tropospheric O3 nega-tive anomalies in 2020 were the most profound since 1994for both Europe and western North America and that the2020 anomalies had a weakening influence on the 1994–2019positive O3 trends above these regions. The O3 reductionsin the free troposphere were also confirmed by the work ofZiemke et al. (2022), in which satellite measurements of tro-pospheric column O3 show that the 2020 negative anoma-lies in the Northern Hemisphere occurred again in spring–summer 2021.In this study, we analyzed the O3 variability at 41 high-elevation sites across the globe, representative of differ-ent environments and emission source regions, during theCOVID-19 economic downturn. The aim of this work is todetermine if the negative O3 anomalies observed in the freetroposphere (e.g., Bouarar et al., 2021; Clark et al., 2021;Steinbrecht et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022; Ziemke et al.,2022) also occurred in the boundary layer by focusing ona selection of mountaintop and high-elevation monitoringsites with available data up to December 2021. Therefore,our study will cover both the COVID-19 economic downturnin 2020 and the following year of 2021, which was associ-ated with a recovery of emissions representative of a pre-pandemic level.The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 will presentthe methodologies adopted, Sect. 3 will focus on the discus-sion of the results obtained, and conclusions will be drawn inSect. 4.2 Methods2.1 Surface ozoneFigure 1 shows the geographical location of the sites consid-ered in this study, and additional details (station name, lati-tude, longitude, and elevation) for each station are reportedin Table 1. Hereafter we will refer to each site by using itsacronym (code), also listed in Table 1. The stations comprisea selection of 41 high-elevation sites worldwide, representa-tive of five different environments (the so-called “regions” inTable 1 and Fig. 1), i.e., (i) 5 European rural or mountain-top sites (EUR), (ii) 19 sites in the western US representativeAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15693–15709, 2023 https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15693-2023D. Putero et al.: Fingerprints of COVID-19 economic downturn on ozone anomalies 15695of rural conditions (WUS_R), (iii) 4 sites in the western USdownwind of highly polluted source areas (WUS_P), (iv) 4eastern US rural sites (EUS), and (v) 9 other globally dis-tributed mountaintop or high-elevation sites (OT). The OTsites are representative of very different environments (e.g.,Antarctic conditions compared to the tropical latitudes of Mt.Kenya or Mauna Loa); however, these sites provide a charac-terization of baseline O3 variability in several regions of theworld that are far away from major anthropogenic emissions.At all of the considered sites the UV-absorption methodis used for measuring surface O3, and common guidelinesare followed for the reliability and consistency of O3 dataamong the different monitoring programs (e.g., Galballyet al., 2013). With the exception of MBO, the 27 high-elevation monitoring sites in the US are Clean Air Status andTrends Network (CASTNET) sites maintained by the Envi-ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National ParkService (NPS). The remaining 14 sites are all part of theGlobal Atmosphere Watch program of the World Meteoro-logical Organization (WMO/GAW), including 9 global sta-tions, 4 regional stations, and 1 contributing station. The dataprocessing involved, when necessary, re-formatting the data,time shifting to UTC (all measurements hereby presentedrefer to UTC), and unit conversions. Similar to the meth-ods of Cooper et al. (2020) and Cristofanelli et al. (2020),the ZSF time series shown here is derived from merging theobservations carried out at both Zugspitze summit and theSchneefernerhaus station (see more details in the Supple-ment).2.1.1 Surface ozone data selectionAs our study focuses on the quantification of O3 anomaliesat high-elevation and remote locations, careful data selectionwas carried out to focus on well-mixed atmospheric condi-tions and to also avoid times of the day that can be influencedby fresh anthropogenic emissions that can lead to the local-ized production or destruction of O3 (Cooper et al., 2020).As the sites in Fig. 1 are representative of very different en-vironments, the analysis of the diurnal cycles led to the iden-tification of the following conditions for data selection.– Nighttime (i.e., between 20:00 and 07:59 local time)data for mountaintop and stations above 1500 m a.s.l.This selection was chosen to focus on regionally rep-resentative O3, and to avoid the presence of local airmasses that are transported, during daytime, from thevalleys up to the mountaintops by upslope winds (Priceand Pales, 1963; Cooper et al., 2020; Cristofanelli et al.,2020). This condition was valid for all of the Euro-pean sites above 1500 m a.s.l., for some of the OT sites(MLO, TLL, IZO, MKN and PDI), and MBO.– Maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) O3 values for allof the US EPA and NPS sites (i.e., all stations belong-ing to WUS_R, WUS_P, and EUS, except MBO). Thiswas chosen as these stations can experience surface de-position at nighttime, which can therefore lower theO3 values. MDA8 values are typically characteristic ofthe time of the day when the boundary layer is wellmixed and are therefore representative of a broad regionaround each measurement site.– Daily mean data for HPB, SUM, and the two stationsin Antarctica (DCC and SPO); the latter three sites arecharacterized by almost no diurnal O3 cycle, and there-fore all data from the full 24 h record can be used.2.1.2 Trend detection and calculation of the anomaliesTo describe and quantify the effects of the COVID-19 eco-nomic downturn on O3 values, we computed monthly O3anomalies at each of the selected sites, derived after remov-ing the seasonal and trend components from the O3 monthlymeans. The deseasonalization allows the production of amore precise trend with less uncertainty and avoids estima-tion bias due to missing data. Similar to Cooper et al. (2020)and Cristofanelli et al. (2020), we followed several stepsto calculate the monthly O3 anomalies (also summarized inFig. S1 in the Supplement).First, we determined the monthly O3 means for each site,setting a threshold of 50 % on hourly data availability foreach month. We also carried out a sensitivity study by adopt-ing a different threshold (i.e., 66 %) or by extending thethreshold to daily means before calculating monthly values.The sensitivity study produced no significant variation in ourresults (see Fig. S2 in the Supplement). The choice of a morerelaxed 50 % threshold was made for retaining enough dataat several sites, such as MKN, MBO, or PDI, which could en-counter various issues that prevented the collection of com-plete data samples each month.Second, we computed the “climatological year”, com-posed of the 20-year mean for each of the 12 months. Thebaseline period for the 20-year mean is 2000–2019; shorterperiods were used if data availability was limited (see Table 1for the different starting years).Then, we obtained the “monthly differences”, i.e., themonth-by-month differences between the monthly meansand the corresponding months of the climatological year.Last, we used the monthly differences for quantifyingthe long-term O3 changes and also to compute the monthlyanomalies (i.e., deseasonalized and detrended monthlymeans) in order to further compare the consistency of theCOVID-19 impact at different sites. We used quantile re-gression for evaluating the trends (and choosing the 50thpercentile, i.e., equivalent to the median regression), whichis recommended as a standard approach for trend analysisfor the TOAR-II activity (Chang et al., 2023b). It is a well-suited technique for detecting heterogeneous distributionalchanges (Chang et al., 2021) and can incorporate covariatessuch as piecewise trends for change point analysis.

To account for autocorrelation and het-eroscedasticity, the moving block bootstrap resampling algo-rithm is implemented (Lahiri, 2003): for each iteration thequantile regression model is fitted to a series of randomlyselected block samples and the sampled trend value is ex-tracted. The final trend value (and its uncertainty) was thendetermined by the mean (and standard deviation) of the sam-pled trend values. All trends are reported with their 95 % con-fidence interval and p value.We also carried out additional analysis to demonstrate thesensitivity of trend estimates based on climatological meansor medians. The results are shown in Fig. S3 of the Sup-plement: although some differences can be seen at individ-ual sites, the general features and conclusions remain thesame, indicating that no systematic discrepancies are foundbetween different approaches to estimate the seasonality.2.2 IASI dataThe IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer)instrument is a nadir-viewing Fourier transform spectrom-eter flying on board the EUMETSAT (European Organisa-tion for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) Metopsatellites (Clerbaux et al., 2009). The IASI instrument op-erates in the thermal infrared between 645 and 2760 cm−1with an apodized resolution of 0.5 cm−1. The field of viewof the instrument is composed of a 2× 2 matrix of pixelswith a diameter at nadir of 12 km each. IASI scans the atmo-sphere with a swath width of 2200 km and crosses the Equa-tor at two fixed local solar times: 09:30 (descending mode)and 21:30 (ascending mode), allowing the monitoring of at-mospheric composition twice a day at any location. Threeversions of the instrument were built and launched at differ-ent times: one aboard the Metop-A platform (October 2006),one aboard the Metop-B platform (September 2012), and oneaboard the Metop-C platform (November 2018). Note thatMetop-A was deorbited in October 2021.Ozone profiles used to calculate O3 partial columns forthis study are described in Dufour et al. (2021). A datascreening procedure is applied to filter cloudy scenes and toensure the data quality (Eremenko et al., 2008; Dufour et al.,2010, 2012). It is worth noting that the maximum sensitiv-ity of the retrieved profile in the lower troposphere is around4 to 6 km (Dufour et al., 2010, 2012). Therefore, we use thelower free-tropospheric column product from 3 to 6 km. Onlythe morning overpasses of IASI are considered in order toensure better sensitivity to the lower troposphere. To coverthe longest possible period with consistent data, we consideronly IASI on Metop-A in this study. A consistency analy-sis of the IASI-A, IASI-B, and IASI-C time series is neededto use the three instruments simultaneously. Consistent withthe surface O3 measurements, we calculated anomalies forthe O3 partial columns, after removing the seasonality andthe trend (see Sect. 2.1.2).https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15693-2023 Atmos.

Decadal O3 trends (50th percentile) for the 41 high-elevation sites used in this study. The reference periods for trendcalculation for the different sites are listed in Table 1. Trends areordered by latitude (y axis), and the colors indicate the sign and pvalue on the trend, with blue shades for negative trends (p ≤ 0.33),red shades for positive trends (p ≤ 0.33), and green for trends of ei-ther sign (p > 0.33). The shapes identify the different regions, i.e.,EUR – Europe, WUS_R – western US “rural”, WUS_P – westernUS “polluted”, EUS – eastern US, OT – other.3 Results and discussion3.1 Ozone trendsA trend analysis spanning the first 2 decades of the 21st cen-tury for long-term observational datasets collected at high-elevation remote and rural locations was performed for mostof the stations. The overall picture is reported in Fig. 2, wheredecadal O3 trends are reported by latitude and grouped byeach of the regions considered in this study (Fig. 1). Thecalculation period of the trends is 2000–2021 (or shorter forsome stations, when data back to 2000 were not available); arecent study (Chang et al., 2023a) has shown that, for MBO,the long-term positive trend was clearly weakened when in-cluding the anomalous year 2020 compared to 2004–2019,but the trend rebounded in 2021, between the 5th and 95thpercentiles. The variations of the long-term trends at all ofthe sites, computed by varying the calculation periods of thetrends (i.e., 2000–2019, 2000–2020, and 2000–2021), are re-ported in Table S1. In several cases, the trends did not revealany relevant impact of the 2020 anomalies, while for 10 sitesthe 2000–2020 trend was weakened compared to 2000–2019,and a rebound was observed when including 2021. It is inter-esting to note that for the European sites above 1500 m a.s.l.(i.e., CMN, JFJ, SNB, and ZSF) the long-term trend wasweakened when including 2020 and continued to weakenwith the addition of 2021 data (see Table S1).Considering the full 2000–2021 record, the observedtrends for the 41 high-elevation sites vary greatly from−4.79to 2.82 ppb per decade. Decreases in surface O3 were ob-served for 30 European and North American sites, withthe exceptions of MBO (2.82 ppb per decade) and GNP(1.30 ppb per decade). The trend values for the sites belong-ing to the OT category showed large differences, with O3increases recorded for TLL (2.26 ppb per decade) and MKN(1.70 ppb per decade); on the other hand, PDI (although lim-ited by the rather short reference period) and SUM stationshowed O3 decreases (−4.79 and −2.37 ppb per decade,respectively). Both Antarctic sites showed positive trends(SPO: 1.33 ppb per decade, and DCC: 0.32 ppb per decade),which are in line with previous studies described in Kumaret al. (2021). It has to be noted that the trend at DCC could beaffected by the large data gap in the measurements between2014 and 2016, and this will certainly need further investiga-tion.The trends for most of the sites in western North Americaconsidered in this study were previously reported by Changet al. (2023a), although considering a slightly longer period(1995–2021). Their results are consistent with the ones re-ported in Fig. 2 for the WUS_R and WUS_P categories, in-dicating that the majority of the sites in western North Amer-ica show a consistent pattern of negative trends, pointing toan overall decrease in regional boundary layer O3. The clearoutlier is MBO, but this site is uniquely situated on the sum-mit of an isolated mountain. During nighttime conditions re-ported here, MBO is strongly influenced by the lower freetroposphere, which has experienced a small increase in O3since the 1990s (Chang et al., 2023a); during summer andautumn MBO is also impacted by ozone produced from west-ern forest fires, which have become more frequent in recentyears (Farley et al., 2022; Jaffe et al., 2022). It has to benoted that the inclusion of 2020 and 2021 in the analysisdid not cause any notable variation in the trend values forseveral sites across the western US (see Table S1), with theeffects of the COVID-19 economic downturn on the long-term trends only visible when considering the spring season(Chang et al., 2023a).Despite their variability when considering different peri-ods for the trend calculation, the trends for the European sitesover 2000–2021 showed persistent negative values whencompared to previous literature (e.g., Cristofanelli et al.,2020; Christiansen et al., 2022). While the trends for JFJand SNB remained almost unchanged, CMN showed a largernegative trend with respect to the 1996–2016 trends reportedin Cristofanelli et al. (2020), and ZSF showed a higher (i.e.,a less negative) value with respect to this reference period.The positive trends in the Southern Hemisphere are in linewith the modeled trends reported by Wang et al. (2022) andwith the trends obtained from the TCR-2 chemical reanalysis(Miyazaki et al., 2020).Regarding positive trends, model studies report increasesin the tropospheric ozone burden occurring mainly in the freeAtmos.

Putero et al.: Fingerprints of COVID-19 economic downturn on ozone anomalies 15699troposphere (700–250 hPa, see Fiore et al., 2022), while thesurface trends tend to be mixed, especially for the extratrop-ical regions in the Northern Hemisphere (see also Miyazakiet al., 2020; Chang et al., 2023a). This is indeed the case forthe European and North American sites reported here (seeFig. 2), indicating that surface O3 trends are often not relatedto the trends observed in the free troposphere (Gulev et al.,2021), as also reported by Chang et al. (2023a). However,we emphasize that the sites in Fig. 2 only cover a limitedportion of the Earth’s surface, as we are limited by the avail-able observations, and these results cannot be assumed to berepresentative of the entire world.3.2 Quantification of the anomaliesFigure 3 provides a detailed summary of the anomalies foreach site, which are grouped by region and ordered by lati-tude. Figure S4 in the Supplement shows the same anoma-lies, but in the form of monthly time series, together withthe mean anomalies for the different regions. Figure 3 showswidespread persistent negative anomalies affecting most ofthe sites in 2020 in both spring (March–May, i.e., MAM) andsummer (June–August, i.e., JJA). The situation was some-what similar in 2021, although some sites showed partial O3rebounds (e.g., the sites in the western US). A closer lookat the mean seasonal differences for the regions is providedin Table 2, while the focus on the spatial distribution of theanomalies (for the sites in North America and western Eu-rope) for 2019, 2020, and 2021 is provided in Figs. S5–S7 ofthe Supplement.By analyzing seasonal means of the anomalies, the west-ern US rural (WUS_R) sites experienced persistent negativeanomalies for MAM and JJA 2020 (−6 % and−5 %, respec-tively), as well as for MAM 2021 (−2 %), while JJA 2021was characterized by a strong positive anomaly (2.8 ppb,6 %). Late summer 2020 was characterized by the spreadof wildfires in the western US (Filonchyk et al., 2022; Jaffeet al., 2022; Peischl et al., 2023; Langford et al., 2023), re-sulting in positive mean anomalies for August and Septem-ber 2020 (2.3 and 2.5 ppb, i.e., 5 % and 6 %, respectively) forseveral sites (see Fig. S6). Without considering August 2020,the JJA 2020 seasonal mean would result in a much morepronounced negative anomaly, i.e., −4.5 ppb (−10 %), giv-ing an indication of the magnitude of the secondary produc-tion of O3 following the spread of wildfires and thus partlyinfluencing the strong negative anomaly that characterizedthis region following the 2020 COVID-19 economic down-turn. As reported by the World Meteorological Organization(2022), the fire season in western North America in 2021 wasalso very intense, with the annual total estimated emissionsranking in the top one-third of the years 2003–2021, and con-tributed to widespread air pollution. The emissions producedby the large widespread wildfires that impacted North Amer-ica in these months can also explain the different patternsin the western US compared to eastern US and Europe (seeFig. 4).The situation for the four western US sites downwind ofpolluted areas (WUS_P) was slightly different, with the neg-ative anomalies being larger than those of WUS_R in MAM2020 (−4.1 ppb, −9 %), and positive anomalies for 2021(3 % for both MAM and JJA 2021). The mean anomaly inJuly 2021 is slightly weaker compared to the WUS_R meandue to the negative anomaly at the JOT site (Fig. 4), despitethe other stations being heavily impacted by the North Amer-ican wildfires (the mean, excluding JOT, for JJA 2021 was2.8 ppb or 5 %).The sites in the eastern US (EUS) category experiencednegative anomalies in 2020 (−4 % and−12 % for MAM andJJA, respectively) and in JJA 2021 (−8 %) and a positiveanomaly in MAM 2021 (3 %). It is interesting to note that,in both of the summer seasons, the EUS sites exhibited anopposite structure with respect to WUS_R and WUS_P sites.The European sites (EUR) were characterized by per-sistent negative anomalies throughout all of the consideredseasons in Table 2. MAM 2020 reported a total negativeanomaly (−2.0 ppb, −3 %) but was characterized by an in-teresting increase in O3 concentrations in April, with valuesalmost comparable to the 2000–2019 values, for all stations(even HPB at lower elevation registered a positive anomalyfor April 2020; see Fig. 3 and Fig. S6 in the Supplement).This feature was previously observed at CMN by Cristo-fanelli et al. (2021), who reported that these higher O3 valueswere possibly attributed to the frequent occurrence of trans-port from the free troposphere, transport from areas usuallynot considered sources of anthropogenic pollution (i.e., theMediterranean Sea or northern Africa), or the transport ofstratospheric air masses. The negative anomalies then con-tinued (except a positive anomaly in June 2021 for HPB,SNB, and ZSF) until September 2021, when all EUR sitesexperienced a rebound in O3 values and registered positiveanomalies until the end of the year.While Table 2 reports mean values for the “other” (OT)sites, a consistent “global” picture cannot be drawn, as thesesites behaved very differently from each other (see Fig. 3).The SUM (and, partly, IZO) anomalies are more in line withthe EUR sites, while DEN, MLO, MKN, and TLL had alter-nating positive and negative anomalies. PDI showed by farthe largest negative anomalies in the first half of 2020 (meanof −8.3 ppb from January to October, −20 %), but unfor-tunately no information on possible O3 recovery in 2021 isavailable due to missing data. The distant Antarctic sites, onthe other hand, did not reveal any signal of influence fromthe COVID-19 economic downturn, with O3 values perfectlyin line with or even higher than the climatological means forboth DCC and SPO. For more details about the interannualvariability at each site, please refer to Figs. S8–S48 in theSupplement.https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15693-2023 Atmos. Chem.

(2022), who observed reduced val-ues of tropospheric column ozone (TCO) in spring–summer2020 and 2021 and who attributed the decrease to reducedpollution (i.e., reductions of ∼ 10 %–20 % in troposphericNO2 in the Northern Hemisphere). More specifically, Ziemkeet al. (2022) indicate a reduction of 3 Dobson units of TCO,corresponding to a ∼ 7 %–8 % decrease for the area 20◦ N–60◦ N. If we consider the seasonal means, excluding the OTcategory, we obtain almost comparable results for 2020 forthe surface O3 observations (mean negative anomalies of−6 % and −7 % for MAM and JJA, respectively). The sit-uation is different in 2021, for which we obtain higher val-ues (0 % for MAM and −6 % for JJA if we consider EUSand EUR only to exclude wildfire influence). However, it hasto be noted that we considered only a selection of sites andthat in some cases our seasonal means can be determined bya combination of sub-seasonal positive and negative anoma-lies (see Sect. 3.2), possibly due to the impact of other “local”factors.As 2020 was characterized by an unusual stratosphericO3 depletion event over the Arctic (Dunn et al., 2021), weinvestigated the possible role of the reduced stratosphericinput in O3 concentrations measured at the high-elevationsites. The minimum in the total column O3 was observed inMarch 2020, and this value rapidly recovered in the follow-ing months (e.g., Dunn et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022). Theeffects of this O3 depletion on the anomalies were also ana-lyzed by Steinbrecht et al. (2021), and simulations from theNASA GMI model indicated that this depletion contributedto less than one-quarter of the observed anomalies in the tro-posphere. Moreover, Ziemke et al. (2022) indicate that theobserved reduction in stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange(STE) in 2020 did not drive the anomalies in the free tro-posphere, as NASA satellite measurements showed negativetropospheric O3 anomalies in both 2020 and 2021, whereasthe meteorological conditions controlling the strength of STEAtmos.

Spatial distribution of the anomalies (1O3) for July(a) and August (b) 2021, for sites in North America and westernEurope. The full series of monthly maps for 2019, 2020, and 2021is provided in the Supplement (Figs. S5–S7).were close to the climatological means in 2021; thus, theysuggested that the tropospheric anomalies can be largely at-tributed to decreases in emissions. This was further con-firmed by our results: Table 2 shows that most of the regionsconsidered in this study showed the largest O3 anomalies inJJA 2020 rather than MAM 2020. Therefore, we hypothesizethat the reduction in the stratosphere-to-troposphere trans-port that occurred in 2020 could have played only a minorrole in modulating the O3 anomalies.3.3.1 Column O3 variability from IASIReductions in mid-tropospheric O3 seen by the IASI satel-lite instrument are similar to the ones from the surface ob-servations. Figure 5 shows the 2008–2020 variability of O3in the 3–6 km column (both monthly means and anomalies)for three specific regions: (i) an area around the EuropeanAlpine sites (i.e., EUR, 40–50◦ N, 5–20◦ E), (ii) the easternUS (EUS, 35–50◦ N, 85–70◦W), and (iii) the western US(WUS, 30–50◦ N, 125–100◦W). As stated in Sect. 2.2, the3–6 km column corresponds to the maximum sensitivity ofthe IASI retrieval in the free troposphere and is, thus, su-perior to the 0–3 km column, where the retrieval sensitivityis more limited and the column is not independent of thecolumn above. We did not include 2021 in the analysis asIASI-A operations stopped before the end of the year and allthe measurements were not done in the nominal mode of thesatellite and the instrument.In all three regions reductions in the 3–6 km column O3were observed in 2020 for both the monthly means and theanomalies. Mean negative anomalies were continuously ob-served throughout MAM and JJA 2020. The anomalies inMAM 2020 were quite similar among the regions, i.e.,−3 %for EUS, −4 % for EUR, and −5 % for WUS. A similaranomaly (−6 %) was also observed for WUS in JJA 2020,and these negative values also persisted in fall (SON), indi-cating that the wildfire influence had only a minor impact atthis upper layer with respect to the surface monitoring sites.For both EUR and EUS, negative anomalies were still ob-served in JJA 2020 (−1 % and −7 %, respectively), and arebound occurred in SON, with values falling within 1 stan-dard deviation of the 2008–2019 climatological mean. Thesmaller EUR anomaly with respect to EUS in JJA 2020 canbe explained by the increase in concentrations that character-ized the European region in June.Despite the differences due to the subsets investigated inthis study, these results are comparable to the reductions infree-tropospheric O3 observed by Steinbrecht et al. (2021),i.e., −7 % (with respect to the 2000–2020 climatologicalmean) from April to August and for the 1–8 km layer inthe Northern Hemisphere. Moreover, the behavior of theanomalies observed here is consistent with the troposphericO3 anomalies shown by Miyazaki et al. (2021) and Ziemkeet al. (2022) discussed above, including the rebound in SON,resulting in column O3 values comparable to the previousyears. However, it has to be noted that our anomalies areweaker than the ones presented in Ziemke et al. (2022),as we are limiting the IASI measurements to land regionsaround our measurement sites, while Ziemke et al. (2022) ob-served the largest negative 2020 and 2021 anomalies abovethe ocean areas of the Northern Hemisphere.3.3.2 Emissions reductionsTo investigate the reductions in the emissions, we analyzeddata from the Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time dataset ofglobal CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and cement produc-tion, available since January 2019 (Liu et al., 2020).Tables 3 and 4 report the CO2 global emissions varia-tions from the Carbon Monitor, divided into the different sec-tors, for the combinations of 2019, 2020, and 2021. As alsodone above for the characterization of the anomalies, herewe consider 2019 to be the reference year for “pre-COVID-19” emissions and 2020 and 2021 to be the ones affected bythe COVID-19 economic downturn, with a possible recoveryin emissions. By analyzing all sectors together, we can im-mediately spot the decrease in emissions occurring in 2020with respect to 2019 (−5.3 %) and the strong rebound ofemissions in 2021 (+0.5 % and +6.1 % with respect to 2019and 2020, respectively). The rebound of emissions near pre-COVID-19 levels was also analyzed in other recent works,indicating that fossil fuel CO2 emissions in 2021 nearlypushed global emissions back to 2019 levels (Jackson et al.,2022) and that 2021 emissions would have even exceeded the2019 values if not for several low-income countries that hadnot recovered from the pandemic yet (Davis et al., 2022).As the strongest O3 anomalies presented in this study areclustered in the western US and Europe, we also focused onregional CO2 anomalies by analyzing the US and Europe val-ues provided by the Carbon Monitor (see Tables S2 and S3https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-15693-2023 Atmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 15693–15709, 202315702 D. Putero et al.: Fingerprints of COVID-19 economic downturn on ozone anomaliesFigure 5. Annual variability of the 3–6 km column O3 monthly means (a, b, c) and anomalies (d, e, f) from IASI for the three regionsconsidered (i.e., EUR, EUS, and WUS; for details on definitions refer to Sect. 3.3.1). The gray lines indicate the single years from 2008 to2019, the black line is the 2008–2019 climatology (together with ± 1 standard deviation, dotted lines), and the red line indicates 2020.in the Supplement). In this case, no distinction between thewestern and eastern US is made, and Europe is consideredto be composed of the emissions in the 27 European Unioncountries plus the United Kingdom. While the decrease in2020 emissions with respect to 2019 was evident for bothregions (−10.9 % and −10.1 % for Europe and the US, re-spectively), the rebound to pre-COVID-19 levels (i.e., 2021against 2019 emissions) was smaller for these two areas withrespect to the global rebound (−2.7 % and −4.5 % for Eu-rope and the US, respectively). This may be one of the causesof the persistent O3 negative anomalies that still character-ized 2021. For Europe, the O3 negative anomalies that wereobserved throughout MAM and JJA 2021 could be partly ex-plained by an incomplete recovery in the emissions (−2.9 %and −6.3 % for MAM and JJA, respectively, considering allsectors together). For the US, the CO2 anomalies are moreevident in MAM 2021 (−5.8 %) than in JJA (−0.3 %).Analyzing the different sectors separately, the limits im-posed on domestic and international aviation caused thelargest negative variations in 2020 with respect to pre-COVID-19 levels; these sectors witnessed the largest re-bounds in 2021, although they did not return to 2019 lev-els (and this was particularly true for international aviation,where a total difference of −48.3 % and −33.9 % was stillobserved for Europe and the US, respectively). Particularlyfor the rural and remote sites, aircraft emissions play a keyrole in determining the tropospheric O3 trends, mainly be-cause of the aircraft emitting NOx in the middle and uppertroposphere, where O3 production efficiency is high (Wanget al., 2022). Therefore, this incomplete recovery in aircraftemissions for 2021 could partly explain the persistent neg-ative anomalies observed. Also, ground transport and, toa lesser extent, residential emissions variations showed thesame behavior (while this was true for the global and USemissions, Europe had larger emissions for these two sec-tors in 2021 with respect to 2019; see Table S2). On a globalscale, rebounds in 2021 for power and industry were so largethat the emissions in this year exceeded those of 2019 (3.9 %Atmos. Chem.

Nevertheless, the datasets discussed here are to datethe most comprehensive time series for investigating theseanomalies from high-elevation stations. The availability ofvalidated 2022 data for the four mountaintop WMO/GAWglobal stations in Europe (i.e., CMN, SNB, ZSF, and JFJ)allowed us to investigate the possible rebound of O3 valuesfor this specific European area that encompasses the Alpsand the northern Apennines (see Fig. 6). In this case, themonthly data were again detrended before the calculation ofthe anomalies, but with respect to the whole 2000–2022 pe-riod; the reference for the calculation of the climatology wasstill the 2000–2019 period.At all four sites, the negative 2000–2019 trends becameincreasingly more negative when including the 2020 and2021 data (see Sect. 3.1 and Table S1). But the inclusionof the 2022 data slightly shifted the trends back towards thepre-pandemic levels, i.e., −2.35 ppb per decade (± 1.53 ppbper decade, p < 0.01) for CMN, −1.34 ppb per decade(± 0.74 ppb per decade, p < 0.01) for SNB, −0.52 ppb perdecade (± 0.77 ppb per decade, p = 0.18) for ZSF, and−0.64 ppb per decade (± 1.04, p = 0.22) for JFJ.When looking at monthly O3 values and anomalies(Fig. 6), an overall rebound for 2022 seems evident in thefirst part of the year (January to March) for all four sites, withmonthly means comparable to the climatology, while theanomalies from April to June showed negative values. Thevalues for the rest of the year were generally within 1 stan-dard deviation of the climatological means, with 2 months(July and August) exhibiting higher monthly means with re-spect to the 2000–2019 baseline. The characteristics of theO3 rebound in 2022, which are commonly shared among thehigh-elevation sites located in western Europe, will certainlyneed deeper investigation, especially for the attribution of thelower values observed from April to June, given that no re-strictions driving the variability of the O3 precursors werepresent in 2022. Other than meteorological variations, min-eral dust transport has been proven to significantly reducethe O3 values at these high-elevation sites (e.g., Duchi et al.,2016). As the first half of 2022 was largely affected by Sa-haran mineral dust transport events reaching western Europe(in both March and June 2022), these could have played animportant role in lowering the O3 values in this period.4 ConclusionsIn this paper we demonstrated that the negative O3 anomaliesthat were observed in the free troposphere in recent studiesalso occurred in the boundary layer surrounding several high-elevation sites. This was done by investigating the surfaceO3 variability at 41 regionally distributed high-elevation sitesfollowing the COVID-19 economic downturn that occurredin 2020 and the following year of 2021, associated with a re-covery of emissions. Widespread persistent negative anoma-lies were observed both in spring (MAM) and summer (JJA)2020 for all of the regions considered in this study, whilefor 2021 continuous negative anomalies throughout MAMand JJA were observed only for Europe and, partially, for theeastern US. On the other hand, the western US sites wereheavily impacted by wildfire emissions in 2021, resulting inpositive anomalies, especially for JJA and for the rural sites.A global picture for the rest of the world could not be drawn,as the sites span a range of different environments and didnot show consistent patterns.The anomaly behavior was further studied by analyzingthe variability in the column O3 from the IASI satellite prod-ucts.

The gray linesindicate the single years from 2000 to 2019, the black line is the 2000–2019 climatology (together with± 1 standard deviation, dotted lines),and the red, blue, and green lines indicate 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.2021; Ziemke et al., 2022), negative anomalies were alsoobserved in the free-tropospheric 3–6 km column O3 prod-uct for both MAM and JJA 2020 (−4 % for both seasons onaverage over the considered regions). These results indicatethat one of the causes of such widespread anomalies is thereduction in the emissions of the O3 precursors. To furtherassess this point, we also investigated the reduction in theemissions for the different sectors for the years 2019, 2020,and 2021, as derived from the Carbon Monitor, a near-real-time dataset of global CO2 emissions. The results highlightthe decrease in emissions that occurred in 2020 with respectto 2019 (−10.9 % and−10.1 % analyzing all sectors togetherfor both Europe and the US, respectively) and the rebound ofemissions in 2021 that took place globally. However, the re-covery in emissions in 2021 did not reach “pre-COVID-19”levels of 2019 in the two macro-regions that encompass mostof the sites investigated here (−2.7 % and−4.5 % for Europeand the US, respectively), and this could be one of the causesof the persistent negative anomalies that were observed inthese two areas.As our dataset was limited to the first full year after the2020 COVID-19 economic downturn, few conclusions couldbe drawn regarding the full recovery of O3 values to pre-COVID-19 levels. However, we made use of 2022 data forfour mountaintop sites in western Europe, and we observeda common pattern concerning O3 variability in 2022. Thiswas characterized by a rebound in the first part of the year(January to March), with monthly values comparable to theAtmos. Chem.

The rebound in O3 values starting from2021–2022 will certainly need deeper investigation, espe-cially concerning the attribution of the wide-ranging variabil-ity, and will be the subject of future research.Data availability.
