Regional Resilience: Are recessionary shocks persistent or transitory?

  Regional Resilience: Are recessionary shocks persistent or transitory?        Justin Andrew Doran  Christ’s College  June 2018                      This dissertation is submitted for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. i  Thesis Summary Justin Doran - Regional Resilience: Are recessionary shocks persistent or transitory?  The response by regional and national economies to exogenous impulses has a well-established literature in both spatial econometrics and in mainstream econometrics and is of considerable importance given the post-2008 economic crisis, which is characterised by a period of severe global instability resulting from unprecedented economic shocks. Martin et al. (2016) note that in economic geography resilience describes regions’ reactions to, and recovery from, negative economic shocks, based on a concept which has been widely used in the engineering and ecological sciences and which has been increasingly adopted in economic geography.  This PhD provides an empirical analysis of resilience at the national, regional, and individual level. Four empirical Chapters are presented which feature econometric analysis in the form of vector error correction (VEC) models, dynamic spatial panel models, and pooled cross sectional models. The national analysis focuses on European counties and the US and analyses the impact of shocks from within the EU and from the US on each country. The second empirical Chapter focuses on US metropolitan statistics areas and analyses the impact of industry structure on the resilience of US metropolitan areas. The third empirical Chapter focuses on the resilience of wages in the US to the global economic crisis. The final empirical Chapter analyses the impact of the crisis on individual’s employment outcomes in select European countries.  The results of the analysis clearly indicate that industry structure plays an important role in explaining the resilience of nations, regional, and individuals (who reside within broader regions). The findings suggest that diversity of economic structure and structural change can result in more resilient regions. At the individual level there is significant evidence that education plays a critical role in explaining the resilience of individuals’ wages and employment outcomes.   ii  Table of Contents Table of

The impact of global recessions on countries’ output growth paths is a highly relevant topic for analysis in light of the 2008 economic crisis.  The IMF notes that the 2008 crisis is the “most dangerous financial shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s” (IMF, 2008: pp xv).  They further suggest that while a recovery is expected “the pickup is likely to be unusually gradual” (IMF, 2008: pp 1).  The crisis, which began in August 2007 after the collapse of the US subprime mortgages market, intensified in September 2008 due to deepening solvency concerns which triggered large scale public intervention in the US and Europe (IMF, 2008).  According to figures from the World Bank (2012) average GDP growth for the global economy for 2002 to 2007 was approximately 5%1 while this slowed to approximately 1.3% in 2007 and contracted by approximately 2% in 2008.  The aim of this PhD is to analyse the resilience of countries, metropolitan areas and individuals to the 2008 economic crisis.  One of the motivations of this PhD is the work of Cerra and Saxena (2008) who suggest that different types of macroeconomic shocks can have a permanent effect on economies’ growth paths.  However, they highlight that not all economies respond in the same way.  I do not distinguish between alternative types of shocks, instead focusing specifically on the impact of economic recessions.  Assessing whether these shocks result in economies’ output being permanently depressed or whether output rebounds following a shock to its pre-shock growth path.  In doing so I analyse a variety of countries, regions and individuals2.  The PhD is also motivated by Fingleton et al. (2012), who explore the regional rather than national dimensions of resilience, and also by the review of the concept of regional resilience by Martin (2012), Martin and Sunley (2014) and Martin et al. (2016).  Fingleton et al. (2012) use vector error correction (VEC) modelling techniques to analyse the persistence of output                                                1 Using GDP in dollars at constant 2000 level prices. 2 While economic output is used for analysing the resilience of countries and regions to the 2008 economic crisis, wages and employment are used for individuals. 2  shocks on regional employment.  Using a VEC framework allows for an analysis of the persistence of shocks and the extent to which shocks and crises spillover from one economy to another, which is the topic of interest to this PhD.  However, VEC techniques limit the number of countries and regions which can be analysed, due to requiring a long time series for robust estimation and a small number of variables to facilitate tests for cointegration, but by utilising spatial panel techniques, it is possible to analyse a large number of observations, while at the same time taking account of the persistence of shocks through time, and controlling for spillover effects, and the spatial transmission of shocks across countries.  Controlling for these spatial effects is an important way to avoid biased estimates and inferences (Corrado and Fingleton, 2012; LeSage, 1998).   The approach used by this PhD in the empirical analysis of resilience is to employ causal economic models as a framework for estimating empirical models.  The results of these empirical models are used to generate counterfactual forecasts of what economic outcomes could have been had the economic crisis not occurred.  These counterfactual predications are then compared to the actual values to assess resilience to the crisis.  A number of alternative outcome measures are used as the PhD progresses through different spatial scales.  At the national level productivity is used as the key indicator.  When analysing city regions GDP is used as the outcome indicator.  Finally, at the individual level wages and employment are considered.    The general approach used in this PhD is as follows.  Initially, vector error correction (VEC) modelling is used, as is standard in the literature, to assess the responses of countries to economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s and to assess whether spatial spillovers in shocks are present.  Having established that shocks appear to be permanent in nature, that the responses to the shocks vary across countries, and that there is spatial transmission of shocks the analysis progresses to assess the impact of the 2008 economic crisis.  Following the country level analysis, metropolitan area resilience is analysed as, even within countries, there is substantial heterogeneity in the responses of regions to crises.  Dynamic spatial panel estimation and forecasting techniques are utilised and a series of possible explanatory factors which may convey resilience are assessed with a specific focus on industry structure.  The final element of this PhD is the analysis of the resilience of individuals to the 2008 economic crisis.  In this instance wage data (in a US context) and employment data (in a European context) are used and again econometric techniques are employed to generate counterfactual series to compare with the actual series.  Individual level characteristics, such as experience and education, are then assessed to understand their contribution to resilience. 3   1.2 Contributing to Existing Literature The contributions of this PhD to existing literature are detailed below.  The contribution of each empirical Chapter is outlined.  The final section (the Conclusions) draws together the contributions and findings of each Chapter.  The contribution of the initial empirical Chapter (Chapter 3), which focuses on time series techniques to analyse resilience to shocks from 1960 to 2011 are threefold.  In this Chapter the focus is on pre-2008 shocks to provide a context for the latter Chapters of the PhD which focus on the 2008 economic crisis.  First, it extends the work of Cerra et. al. (2008; 2009), but differs significantly in that it is concerned with non-stationary series (i.e. uses VEC not VAR models). Thus it contributes to the hysteresis and resilience literature focussing on the potentially permanent, rather than transient, impact of shocks on subsequent growth.  Second, it extends the work of Fingleton et. al. (2012) by modelling both GDP and employment levels combined to give productivity levels, applying this to the international level rather than being restricted to UK regions. And thirdly, it focuses on contagion and spillover effects, asking the question, ‘do shocks in neighbouring countries have a major effect domestically?’  The fourth Chapter contributes to the existing literature in a number of ways.  First, the modelling approach, involving both dynamic and spatial interaction, is relatively unusual and a clear advance on static spatial panel approaches which do not take account of time-dependency in spatio-temporal series. Secondly, and somewhat unusually, the dynamic spatial panel model (DSPM) estimation takes account of the potential endogeneity of the regressor, output, with respect to employment. Thirdly, the focus is essentially on city-region (i.e. MSA) resilience, in contrast to the more usual region- or country-specific estimates of resilience found in the literature.  Fourthly, the analysis seeks to avoid omitted variables bias by introducing covariates, and allows for endogeneity in the regression analysis, in an attempt to obtain consistent causal effects of industrial structure on resilience.     The fifth Chapter contributes to the existing literature by considering individual level resilience to the 2008 economic crisis.  The idea is to use individuals as the fundamental unit of analysis, rather than regions, cities or nations. This allows for the examination of the impacts of recent economic shocks focusing on an important aspect of the local economy, namely the level of individual wages.  The starting point for modelling individual wages is the wage equations derived from New Economic Geography (NEG) and Urban Economics (UE) theory, where 4  wages are a function of market potential and employment density respectively.  Expanding from the typical NEG and UE wage equations individual-specific factors which could influence wages are controlled for, as typically modelled in a Mincerian wage equation, such as experience, gender, qualifications and job-type, which when combined with the aggregate NEG and UE indicators allows for an assessment of the resilience of individuals, controlling for their intrinsic characteristics, to shocks in their local labour market.  The sixth Chapter extends the work of Chapter 5 by considering employment resilience at the level of the individual.  It is one of few pieces of research which to date analyses resilience in the regional context using the individual as the unit of analysis.  This Chapter provides insights into how individual specific characteristics and regional variations can help explain the resilience of employment outcomes during an economic crisis. The Chapter focuses on the crisis as it was experienced in 2010, following crisis impacts going forward from 2008.  1.3 Structure of the PhD The structure of this PhD is as follows.  Chapter 2 provides a review of existing literature on economic resilience.  It focuses on a number of concepts which are central to this PhD.  The first is engineering resilience (anti-hysteresis), the second is ecological resilience (hysteresis), and the third is adaptive resilience.  It then provides a discussion of the three key theories used to develop econometrics models in the later Chapters of the PhD.  Specifically it discusses Verdoorn’s law, New Economic Geography (NEG) theory, and Urban Economics (UE) theory.    Chapter 3 is the first of the empirical Chapters of this PhD.  It focuses on the resilience of European countries to economic shocks since 1960.  Verdoon’s law is used as the theoretical lens through which the empirical analysis is conducted.  Shocks originating from different sources are considered.  The Chapter uses vector error correction models to derive dynamic forecasts and orthogonalized impulse response functions (OIRFs) to analyse the resilience of countries to negative shocks.  Elements of this Chapter have been published in the journal Papers in Regional Science as: “Doran, J., & Fingleton, B. (2014). Economic shocks and growth: Spatio-temporal perspectives on Europe's economies in a time of crisis. Papers in Regional Science, 93(S1), S137-S165”.    Chapter 4 is the second empirical Chapter and progresses the analysis from country level to city level. The main contribution of this Chapter is to focus on cities as the unit of analysis, which is rare in empirical studies of resilience.  Specifically US metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) 5  are analysed.  Also Verdoon’s law is again used as the theoretical lens for the analysis.  In total 373 US MSAs are analysed to provide insights into their resilience to the 2008 economic crisis.  Elements of this Chapter have been published as “Doran, J., & Fingleton, B. (2018). US metropolitan area resilience: insights from dynamic spatial panel estimation. Environment and Planning A: Economy and Space, 50(1), 111-132”.  Chapter 5 is the third empirical Chapter of this PhD.  It progresses the analysis by considering the individual as the unit of analysis.  Using data from the American Community Survey (ACS) a model of individual’s wages is estimated and individuals’ wage resilience to the 2008 economic crisis is analysed using pooled regression analysis.  Due to the use of the individual as the unit of analysis, it is inappropriate to consider Verdoon’s law as the theoretical lens for analysis and instead Mincer’s wage equation is used.    Elements of this Chapter have been published in the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society  as: “Doran, J., & Fingleton, B. (2015). Resilience from the micro perspective. Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society, 8(2), 205-223”.    Chapter 6 is the fourth and final empirical Chapter of this PhD.  It builds upon the previous Chapter by considering employment resilience to the 2008 economic crisis using the European Social Survey (ESS).  Again the individual is the unit of analysis.  The main contribution of this Chapter is to consider, at an individual level, what factors convey employment resilience in the face of an economic crisis.  Elements of this Chapter have been published in the journal Regional Studies as: “Doran, J., & Fingleton, B. (2016). Employment resilience in Europe and the 2008 economic crisis: insights from micro-level data. Regional Studies,50(4), 644-656”.   Chapter 7 presents the conclusions drawing together the different empirical Chapters of this PhD.   6  Chapter 2: Literature Review In this Chapter I provide an overview of the three prevalent conceptual foundations of resilience; engineering, ecological, and adaptive resilience.  Following the discussion of these factors the Chapter presents the conceptual framework proposed by Martin et al (2016) for the process of adaptive resilience which can be summarised in four components; (i) risk, (ii) resistance, (iii) reorientation, (iv) recovery.  I present a brief summary of this model and outline the advances this PhD dissertation makes in terms of re-interpreting this through the application of formal economic models and counterfactual forecasting techniques to analyse the role of reorientation in promoting resistance and recovery.  This is followed by a discussion of the existing literature on resilience which summarises key articles in this area and provides a wider context for this PhD research.  Finally, the economic models which are used throughout this dissertation (Verdoorn’s law, new economic geography theory, and urban economics theory) are presented and discussed.   2.1 Regional Resilience – an Overview Davis and Weinstein (2008) note that the concept of multiple equilibria is a hallmark of modern economics extending to  diverse areas of the discipline.  However, they suggest that it is not an easy phenomenon to test as, at any moment in time, only the actual equilibrium is observable, not the innumerable potential equilibria which could have existed had the economy followed a different development path.  Moreover changes over time may be due to changing fundamentals within the economy and do not necessarily indicate the evolution to new equilibria.  However, following the 2008 crisis there has been increasing interest in resilience (sometimes defined in part as the ability to resist moving to new, lower equilibrium points).  Examples of recent studies are Fingleton et al. (2012), Martin (2012) and Fingleton and Palombi (2013), Martin et al. (2016), Brown and Greenbaum (2017), and Bristow and Healy (2018).  This PhD proposes to analyse the resilience of countries, regions and individuals to economic shocks.   Simmie and Martin (2010) note that there is no universal definition of resilience.  Martin (2011) and Fingleton et al. (2012) define resilience based on its Latin root, resilire, which is to “leap back or rebound” (Martin, 2011: pp 4).  They note that resilience can be defined as the ability of an entity or system to recover from a shock of some kind.  Foster (2007: pp 14) defines resilience as “the ability of a[n economy] to anticipate, prepare for, respond to and recover from a disturbance”.  While Hill et al. (2008: pp 4) defines a resilient region as having the ability “to recover successfully from shocks to its economy that either throw it off its growth path or have the potential to throw it off its growth path”.  7  Cross et al. (2010) note that within this definition of resilience two possible views can be adopted.  The first is referred to in the literature as engineering resilience and suggests that resilience defines the ability of a system to recover to its pre-shock state following a shock.  Typically the system is viewed as being in equilibrium before the shock and resilience relates to the time taken to return to this equilibrium position following a disruption.   Alternatively, resilience can be viewed as a system’s ability to adjust to a new state following a shock.  Again, this can assume that a system is in equilibrium prior to the shock and the resilience of the system relates to its ability to transition from the pre-shock equilibrium to a new equilibrium post-shock.  This is referred to as ecological resilience.  Simmie and Martin (2010) note that there are a number of lenses through which resilience can be considered; these being equilibrium and evolutionary theory.  While this discussion makes use of the assumption of equilibrium positions Martin (2010) argues that, even discounting equilibrium theory, for these concepts of resilience to hold all that is required is that following a shock the economy returns to where it would have been in the absence of that shock, regardless of whether or not that position is an equilibrium point, or adjusts to a new stable growth path.    Simmie and Martin (2010) raise the question as to whether resilience should measure not only an economy’s ability to recover from shocks or transition to a new equilibrium but also their ability to resist shocks.  They note that economies which can resist shocks are much more likely to recover than an economy which is severely affected by the shock.  They also question whether resilience relates to the ability of the economy to retain its structure throughout the shock or whether resilience should also consider the ability of an economy to restructure its industries and firms in order to recover.  They also point out that the resilience of an economy is likely to vary over time and may be dependent on the nature of the shock and may change as the economy becomes more advanced and evolves.  This has led them to extend upon the two measures presented in Cross et al. (2010) by including a third concept of resilience, adaptive resilience.    The following sub-sections describe in detail three concepts of resilience, which have their foundation in sciences outside of economics, and relates them to economic theories.  The concept of engineering resilience is similar to Friedman’s plucking model of growth while ecological resilience can be related to the concept of hysteresis.  The final concept is that of adaptive resilience which relates to evolutionary economic theory.  A concise summary of these three concepts is present in Martin and Sunley (2014) and is summarized, based on their typology, in Table 2.1.  8  Table 2.1 Definitions of Resilience Title Definition/Type Interpretation Main Field of Use Economic Link Engineering, Anti-Hysteresis, Plucking Model Resilience as bounce back from shocks Shocks are transitory in nature, bounce back occurs, the emphasis is on the speed of recovery Engineering resilience found in physical sciences.

Based on and adapted from Martin and Sunley (2014) 2.2 Engineering Resilience/Anti-Hysteresis Perrings (1998) identifies two types of resilience.  The first is concerned with the time taken for a disturbed system to return to some initial state and arises from Pimm (1984).  Perrings (1998) refers to this type of resilience as engineering resilience.  Cross  et al. (2009) identifies that this form of resilience has become referred to as engineering resilience as it is based on premises arising from the engineering discipline.  The definition draws heavily on the concept of the conservation of energy.  Taken in terms of economics the conservation of energy implies that nothing is lost or permanently changed if an individual, a market or an economy as a whole faces a temporary disturbance no matter how large.  It implies that shocks have a transient effect on economies, with the economy returning to its pre-shock equilibrium position following the shock.   9  Engineering resilience can be thought of as an economy’s ability to rebound after a shock.  Essentially, this definition of resilience relates to the ability of an economy to resist a shock and the subsequent speed of return following the shock to the economy’s pre-shock state.  One can think of the system as being in equilibrium prior to the shock and that the shock temporally knocks the system off this equilibrium.  An economy is more resilient than another if it is able to better resist the initial shock and if it returns more quickly to its pre-shock equilibrium state (Martin, 2011; Fingleton et al., 2012).  Martin (2011) links this notion of resilience with economic theories relating to self-correcting forces in mainstream economics.  The economy is assumed to be self-equilibrating so that any shock that moves it from its equilibrium point automatically engages compensating mechanisms that brings the economy back to equilibrium.  These self-correcting forces may take a while to activate but the assumption is that the economy will eventually return to its pre-shock levels.  Fingleton et al. (2012) and Martin (2011) note that engineering resilience displays characteristics which are similar to Friedman’s (1993; 1964) plucking model.  Figure 2.1 displays a stylised diagram of the plucking model.  This model of growth can be likened to a string attached to the underside of an upward sloping board.  The string can be plucked downward at times by shocks, however, the string will always rebound to the level of the board.  The board represents the slowly increasing ceiling level of output set by an economy’s factors of production.  While the extent of the decline in output will vary from shock to shock, output is assumed to rebound in all cases to the ceiling level.   This model therefore assumes that shocks are temporary in nature and have no permanent effect on an economy’s long-run growth ceiling or growth trend.      10  Figure 2.1: Anti-hysteresis   Source: redrawn from Fingleton et. al. (2012) 2.3 Ecological Resilience and Hysteresis Perrings (1998) identifies the second conceptualisation of resilience as referring to the size of a shock that can be absorbed by the system before the system is shifted from one equilibrium to another.  It assumes that systems are characterised as possessing numerous equilibria.  Martin (2011) refers to this as ecological resilience.  This conception of resilience focuses on the role of shocks in pushing the system beyond its recovery threshold to a new domain.  In this instance, one way to measure resilience is the magnitude of the shock required to push the economy from one path to another.  Martin (2011) notes that this implies that ecological resilience is the capacity of a system in equilibrium to tolerate shocks without reorganising into an new equilibrium position.  The underlying assumption is that there are a number of equilibrium positions and that if a sufficiently strong shock occurs the economy is pushed to a new equilibrium point.  As noted already, one way of measuring resilience in this instance is by determining the strength of the shock required to force the economy to a new equilibrium.  Therefore, one economy is more resilient if it can absorb a larger shock than another before adjusting to a new equilibrium.  Alternatively, this concept of resilience can relate to the ability of an economy, when pushed beyond its threshold, to move quickly to a new equilibrium position.  Resilience under this view depends on the point at which the economy ends up.  If the post-shock position is worse than the predecessor then such an economy would be deemed Employment or Output Time Recessionary Shock 11  to have a lower resilience than an economy which was able to move to a relatively better post-shock position.    Martin (2011) notes that this definition of ecological resilience is similar to the economic concept of  hysteresis.  This is characterised as a system which has multiple equilibria and which can be moved from one equilibrium to another as a result of a shock.  Romer (2001) defines hysteresis as a situation where “one time disturbances permanently affect the path of the economy” (pp 471).  Essentially the memory of the shock is left behind in the economy even after the shock has faded away.  This process can also be termed remembrance.  This can involve structural change within the economy.  It implies that a temporary shock can have permanent effects on an economy, which can be thought of as a form of path dependence.  Martin (2011), Fingleton et al. (2012) and Cross et al. (2010) note that it is possible to envisage a number of different possible hysteretic outcomes of a shock and that the outcome may depend on the variable considered as well as the underlying structure of the economy.  Two possible negative hysteric outcomes can be identified.  In the first instance, the shock causes a downward shift in the variables growth path, but the growth rate returns to pre-shock levels.  This may result from a shock destroying a significant proportion of the economy’s productivity capacity and jobs (see Figure 2.2 a).  The second negative outcome is where, not only is there a downward shift in the level of the variable, but also a reduction in the growth rate of the variable.  This may result from the destruction of large sections of an economy’s industrial base which may have a negative multiplier effect on other sectors; reducing not only the level but also the growth rate of the variable post-shock (see Figure 2.2 b).    However, Martin (2011) and Cross et al. (2010) note that not all hysteric effects need be negative.  Two positive hysteretic reactions can also materialise following a shock.  In both instances, the economy more than rebounds from the shock and initially experiences rapid growth, in excess of the pre-shock level, following the initial downward effects of the shock.  This may be due to optimistic business expectations, the availability of spare capacity to expand or new firm foundations.  The distinction between the two possible positive hysteric effects is whether the post-shock growth rates can be maintained.  If the scope for continued rapid expansion becomes exhausted, the economy may return to pre-shock growth levels, albeit at a higher level (see Figure 2.2 c).  However, if the economy can maintain the post-shock growth rates this implies continued growth at a rate in excess of the pre-shock level (see Figure 2.2 d).  Stylised versions of all of these responses are depicted in Figure 2.2.  12  Cross et al. (2010) appeal to a Schumpeterian point of view of creative destruction to explain these hysteresis effects.  If the creative destruction aspects of the recession were sufficient to outweigh the destructive aspects the outcome would be an increase in potential output levels.  This would mean a stronger growth in output during the recovery from the recession with the growth rate returning to normal post-recovery.  However, if the growth rate can be maintained Cross et al. (2010) term this a Schumpeterian super recession in that while output falls during the recession, the growth rate of the economy is permanently increased, resulting in the economy overtaking its previous equilibrium position.  Alternatively, if the destructive elements outweigh the creative elements the recession may cause a shift downward in the level of the economy.  As before the growth rate may return to post-shock levels or may be permanently depressed.    Blanchard and Summers (1987), in the context of unemployment, note that the concept of hysteresis can refer to “the development of alternative theories of unemployment embodying the idea that the equilibrium unemployment rate depends on the history of the actual unemployment rate. Such theories may be labelled hysteresis theories after the term in the physical sciences referring to situations where equilibrium is path-dependent” (pp 290). Thus a negative shock leading to permanently higher unemployment may occur if the long term unemployed lose skills and miss out on job training, so that they ultimately become unemployable. In contrast, the employed continue to benefit from learning-by-doing. This viewpoint of hysteresis in unemployment is supported by Jaeger and Parkinson (1994) and Jacobson, Vredin and Warne (1997).  Krugman (2011) provides a similar argument.    Insight into hysteretic shocks is also provided by studies relating to real business cycle theory which are also concerned with the persistence of shocks and also asymmetries in the responses of positive and negative shocks.  For example, Beaudry and Koop (1993) analyse the persistence of shocks to national  output,  noting that while there are asymmetries in the responses of economies to positive and negative impulses, both are persistent (specifically they find positive shocks to be more persistent than negative shocks).  Hamilton (1989) provides further evidence that recessionary shocks result in a permanent negative drop in countries’ output.  Diebold and Rudebusch (1989) also support this permanent shock-effect hypothesis.      13  Figure 2.2: Stylised Responses to Shocks  Source: redrawn from Fingleton et. al.

This concept according to Folke (2006) incorporates the idea of adaptation, learning, self-organization and the ability to persist despite disturbance.  Tóth (2015) states that this approach is based on the adaptive notion of resilience, which originates in the theory of complex adaptive systems preferred by scholars working in evolutionary economic geography and he notes Holling and Gunderson (2002), Folke (2006), Martin and Sunley (2007), and Simmie and Martin (2010) are proponents of this approach.  Martin and Sunley (2014) notes that the concept adaptive resilience can be related to the notion of ‘positive adaptive resilience’, which they trace to the behavioural psychological  literature.  This is used within this literature to describe how individuals maintain or regain their psychological wellbeing following some form of shock (not a shock in the economic context but one to their wellbeing such as a personal trauma or crisis).  They note that in this literature resilient individuals are those that are found to demonstrate dynamic self-renewal whereas less resilient individuals are negatively impacted by their stressors.  They note that although not explicitly stated in some of the resilience literature the concept of adaptive resilience is built into much of the discussion of resilience.  The idea of recovering following a shock typically involves some degree of reorientation of the economy and this has led to this sometimes being referred to as evolutionary resilience or bounce forward.  It is also linked with the idea of complex adaptive systems, although Martin and Sunley (2014) note that this literature does not typically use the phrase resilience but instead focuses on what they term robustness as a feature of a system.  Martin and Sunley (2014) relate the idea of robust adaption to that of organisational change to restore a pre-shock growth path.   2.5 The Elements of Resilience In a series of papers Martin (2012), Martin and Sunley (2014), and Martin et al. (2016) propose a conceptual model arising from their discussion of adaptive resilience.  This model, which breaks resilience down into four components (i) risk, (ii) resistance, (iii) reorientation, and (iv) recovery describes the process of how regions are exposed to shocks, behave during shocks, and recover following shocks [see Martin et al. (2016) page 565 for the complete model].  They note that these steps are sequential and recursive.    The first step is in terms of the risk a region faces.  This is essentially the vulnerability of the region to shocks and its potential exposure.  This can be the exposure of firms, individuals, 15  institutions, or governance structures, amongst others, to shocks.  Different regions may have more exposure to different types of shocks based on a variety of these factors.    The second stage of the process is the resistance of the region to the shock.  This is dependent upon the scale, nature and duration of the shock to hit the region.  More severe shocks may be expected to have a stronger impact on the region than less severe shocks.  Likewise, the length of the shock may vary.  These factors impact on the possible ability of a region to resist the onset of a shock.  Of course, the region’s structure, capabilities, resources etc. may also help resist the shock (or may possibly make it less resistant).  The reorientation of the region following the onset of the shock relates to the extent and nature of the adjustment to the shock.   Martin et al. (2016) note the adaptive element of resilience in their concept enters here in the form of reorientation.  Following the shock the region reorganises its structures, industries, institutions etc.    The degree of reorientation may impact on the recoverability of a region.  This is the post-crisis recovery of the region which may be to its previous growth path, or a new higher or lower growth path. A region’s post-crisis recovery to a new growth path, or its lack of recovery, can have long run implications in terms of widening or reducing regional inequalities (Martin et al., 2016).   2.6 A typology of Resilience Studies In this section I provide a typology of resilience studies, based upon, and extending, the typology presented in Martin and Sunley (2014).  A summary of these are presented in Table 2.2.  These alternative methods are briefly defined as follows.  The case study approach is essentially descriptive in nature and focuses on one or a small number of regions.  Typically a regional specific shock is studied such as the decline of a particular industry (Bailey and Berkeley, 2014).  When more regions are considered a common approach is the construction of resilience indices.  These provide insight into the severity of shocks as well as the extent of recovery.  They are based around the identification of a particular time period when a shock occurs and are sensitive to the exact specification of this period (Martin, 2012), and  usually capture the extent of decline followed by the speed of recovery.  Time series analysis, often in the form of vector autoregressive or vector error correction models, is typically employed for regional resilience studies which focus on a relatively small number of regions but over a long time period (usually utilising quarterly data).  An advantage of these models is their statistical robustness, however, they are limited to small numbers of regions (or else the methodology 16  becomes unwieldy) and also necessitate a long time period for analysis (Fingleton et al., 2012).  Fourthly, an analysis based on formal economic models utilising spatial panel econometric techniques can be employed.  The types of regional economic models utilised vary from those based on the Wage Curve (Fingleton and Palombi, 2013) to the wide family of models whose provenance is the Dixit-Stiglitz theory of imperfect competition [see Chapter 4 for an example of this which has been published as Doran and Fingleton (2018)].  The final type of analysis is relatively new and is based on merging individual level data with regional data to analyse the impact of economic shocks on individuals [see Chapter 5 and 6 for examples of this type of analysis which have been published as Doran and Fingleton (2015) and Doran and Fingleton (2016)]. Analysis at the individual level is still relatively rare but it advantageously allows one to capture effects which might otherwise be difficult to model, and the necessary individual level data are increasingly accessible. Also, increasingly, techniques to exploit such data are being developed and becoming more readily available.   “One of the main contributions of this PhD is to extend the standard methodological analysis of resilience.  This has been done by focusing on causal economic models and the analysis of individual level data.  To date this type of analysis has, to the author’s knowledge, not been conducted.  In Chapters 3 and 4 Verdoorn’s law is used to provide the framework for a causal economic analysis of resilience, while in Chapters 5 and 6 the analysis is conducted at the level of the individual.  As highlighted in Martin and Sunley (2014) the introduction of causal economic models in resilience analysis in Chapter 4 marks a significant departure from the typical use of case studies or indices and provides a distinct framework for the analysis of regional economic resilience. While the use of individual level data in Chapter 6 is highlighted by Bailey and Turok (2016) as making an	“important	contributions	to	ongoing	debates,	including	…	considering	resilience	from	the	perspective	of	the	individual”.”     17  Table 2.2: Summary of Existing Methodologies and Results Type of Study Method Used Area of Analysis Results Authors Case Study Qualitative analysis.

The previous section discussed the general typologies.  This section discusses papers which have used the above types of analysis.  It presents the scope of their analysis, their methods, their findings, and any relevant conclusions.  This provides a context for the following Chapters.    Beginning with the conceptualisation and analysis of resilience Martin (2012) provides what he describes as a ‘preliminary’ empirical analysis of UK regions’ economic resilience.  It is here that Martin (2012) first argues that there are four dimensions are needed to capture the idea of regional economic resilience in relation to recessionary shocks, namely: resistance, recovery, renewal and re-orientation.  The results presented indicate that regional resilience varies over time.   Martin (2012) attributes this to differences in the causes and nature of individual recessionary shocks, but also suggests that this may be caused by the factors and mechanisms that shape economic resilience evolving themselves.  This conclusion is drawn as Martin (2012) finds that the impact of the 2008 economic crisis was less differentiated between northern and southern regions compared with the previous two recessions.    Following this Martin et al. (2016) use data for 40 years to analyse how UK regions have responded to four major recessions.  They focus their analysis on the role of industry structure as a possible cause and consequence of resilience.  The analysis focuses on the use of indices of resistance and recovery.  They also note the importance of a region’s own competitiveness in determining its ability to be resilient.  They conclude that the concept of the economic cycle is far from dead and that the impact of this cycle is varied at a sub-national level.  They further suggest that shocks impact different regions in different ways throughout time, with regions not responding in the same way to each shock.  They note that some regions of the UK have bounced back more strongly in general from shocks and that these are typically the regions of the South-East. 19   In a broader European context Sensier et al. (2016) provide an analysis of selected European countries (this is actually the majority of EU countries) focusing on identifying the duration of the shock and its impact.  The focus is on regional economies within Europe and when they experienced a shock and for how long this shock lasted.  It does not, as the authors note, aim to identify why certain regions were resilient but instead focusses on the identification of resilient regions, noting that identifying factors which determine resilience was an avenue for future research.  Courvisanos et al. (2016) provide an analysis of resilience focusing on the Australian economy.  They focus on identifying resilience by industrial categories and regions using an adaptive resilience conceptual framework.  They identify two major shocks in their data, a natural drought and also the global financial crisis.  They identify certain industries as more resilient than others (noting that these are mining and then typically service sectors).  Noting that these sectors may draw their resilience from Australia’s competitive advantage based on exports of raw material and commercial services.    An example of an application of time series econometric techniques to the study of resilience can be found in Fingleton et al. (2012).  They provides an empirical analysis of 12 UK NUTS1 regions for the period 1971 to 2010 using a seemingly unrelated regression analysis and a vector error correction model.  The analysis indicates that UK regions respond differently to economic shocks and that the differences are mainly a result of differences in their initial ability to resist the onset of a shock.  They find that employment shocks typically have a permanent effect and that there are inter-regional spillovers, but that these are typically confined to proximate regions.    Cellini and Torrisi (2014) provide an empirical analysis of Italian regions using a time series which spans from 1890 to 2009.  The analysis used by the authors is essentially the same as that of Fingleton et al. (2012) with the exception that it focuses on annual GDP per capita rather than quarterly employment to analyse resilience. The authors note that shocks across Italian regions have permanent effects on the growth paths of the regions.  However, they note that recovery following shocks is approximately the same across regions, with no region showing signs of above average recoverability.    Di Caro (2017) consider engineering resilience and ecological resilience and propose a methodology to test between them using VAR models as opposed to the VEC models used by 20  Cellini and Torrisi (2014) and Fingleton et al. (2012).  They note that up until 2007 from the 1970s the main focus of economics was that employment shocks were temporary in nature.  However, post 2007 there has been an increase focus on the view that these shocks may be more permanent in nature.  The authors note that there are a number of determinants of regional economic resilience.  They suggest that this is still an open question and that there is much research focused on the role of differing factors on the promotion of resilience.  There is a significant body of work which relates industry structure to economic performance at the regional level, much of it following the seminal work of Glaeser et al. (1992). In their work,  Glaeser et al. (1992) provided a comprehensive analysis of the role of local competition, urban variety, and regional specialisation on economic growth using data for 170 US cities across a variety of industries from 1956 to 1987.  Their findings provided support that knowledge spillovers occur between diverse industries  as opposed
