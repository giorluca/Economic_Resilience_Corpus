As a result, the sales process must also be carried out in their respective homes, so in this case, they have undergone a transformation based on digital technology. This study aims to describe the sales process strategy during the Covid-19 Pandemic and Post-Covid-19 Pandemic, find out the forms of media and methods used in digital-based sales and purchases, and examine the challenges faced in digital-based sales, and identify the impact of sales digital-based to economic resilience. This study uses a qualitative approach. Design The research used in this study is phenomenology. Qualitative research data is descriptive; this data is presented in words, pictures, and tables at the research location used in Surabaya City, East Java Province. The informants of this research were determined using purposive sampling chosen with specific considerations and goals. Data collection techniques used in this study were observation, in-depth interviews, focus group discussion (FGD), and documentation. In this study it was found that traders needed to have a new strategy to continue marketing their wares during the Covid-19 pandemic and post-covid-19 pandemic. This new strategy became a new opportunity and added income because they could sell online and offline. Furthermore, there needs to be an increase in the quality control of merchandise so that buyers feel safe buying and transacting.  Keywords: seller strategic; market; covid-19; economic resilience   INTRODUCTION Countries worldwide face the threat of human death due to the CoronaVirus, also known as Covid-19. Initially, this virus appeared in Wuhan City, People's Republic of China. It originated from the consumption of bats by one of the people in the city of Wuhan or a possible leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (Davidson & Rasyid, 2020). Covid-19 is spreading very quickly to countries worldwide; one of the patterns of spread causing Covid to be widespread is due to human interactions. Symptoms of the presence of Covid-19 can be seen through coughing, runny nose, shortness of breath, dizziness, and through lifestyles (lifestyle), which are unhealthy (Danugroho, 2022). People can reduce the chances of contamination of covid by using masks, frequently washing hands, and using hand sanitisers, which is important to keep germs away and maintain the body's immune resistance. This swift distribution pattern is implemented in many countries, thus lockdowns are implemented; this is done to keep humanity alive and well (Danugroho, 2022). Lockdowns are when people are forbidden from entering places with possible crowds or leaving their houses for a certain period of time. To this day, Italy is the country with the most Covid-19 deaths in the world, and the United States is the country with the most cases in the world, beating the country where Covid-19 originated, in this case, the People's Republic of China. Makmur and Ahmed, Digital-Based Sales Transformation in Strengthening Economic Resilience  94  Indonesia, as a country with the largest population in Southeast Asia and is ranked fourth in the world; wants the lives of its people to continue to disappear. Shipping and trade flows that are so dense every day from all over the world have consequences in the spread of Covid-19 as well. Based on data submitted by the Joint Unit (Satgas) formed by the Central Government of the Republic of Indonesia to convey developments in the Covid-19 case, as of Sunday, March 29, 2020, there have been 1,285 positive cases of Covid-19, 114 of whom have died. If you pay attention, this number continues to increase daily; even those who have recovered are very small until Sunday, March 29, 2020, only 64 people. Currently, the distribution pattern is not only in the capital city, in this case, DKI Jakarta, but has reached Indonesia in other areas; many areas that still need to be included in the red zone are now included in the red zone. However, out of 34 provinces in Indonesia, DKI Jakarta and West Java occupy the provinces with the clearest cases of Covid-19. The distribution pattern and the increase in the number of positive cases of Covid-19 have raised concerns from all parties, not only the upper class but also the lower classes, causing fear and anxiety even though the Government of the Republic of Indonesia always urges us to remain calm and alert (Jamil et al., 2016). If you look at the regions, for example, what happened in the Rukun Warga (RW) in Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta Special Region, they have lockdown independently; this was done after the issuance of an appeal by the Governor of the Special Region of Yogyakarta and instruction from the Regent of Sleman Regency, with an appeal to people who come from overseas, especially from DKI Jakarta as the main area for the spread of Covid-19 to self-isolate for 14 days, this is done so that this does not happen the spread of Covid-19 in their environment. Even Tegal City and Tasikmalaya Regency have done lockdowns independently to protect the people in the area. Constitutionally it does lockdown. This is the authority of the central government, not local governments, but the community's excessive concern has led to various ways to protect themselves from the spread of Covid-19 (Danugroho, 2022). The central government has been advising the public not to go home this year; social distancing and physical distancing have also been implemented to handle and prevent the pattern of spreading Covid-19. Frequently hand washing with soap must be done by the community, even to the point of using masks. There are no words for handling and preventing lockdowns because of considerations other than the economy, the availability of food, and the behaviour of the Indonesian people who lack discipline. Of course, the decision-making by the central government has been carried out carefully with various considerations and the consequences that will occur (Sadono, 2020). If the central government takes steps to lock down for 14 days, you can think about and imagine the consequences for the Indonesian people. A lesson can be taken from India, with its population, which ranks second in the world, which is currently implementing its lockdown. Then it became chaotic because many people flocked to their hometowns, which caused panic buying and social inequality. People began to stock up on many items, leading the less fortunate to have less access to these items, such as toilet paper rolls. Malaysia is a neighbouring country and is one family with Indonesia; when applying lockdown, many people are hungry, lack food, and fall into Antroposen : Journal of Social Studies and Humaniora Vol. 2, No. 2, Desember 2023: 93-104, DOI 10.33830/antroposen.v2i2.5511 95  poverty. However, if left alone without treatment and prevention, there will be more and more victims of Covid-19. Although not being able to go out has decreased the immune system of many, leading to people catching covid with bad symptoms once exposed. The United States is a country that prohibits its people from staying at home and, just as usual, carrying out their activities outside the home with economic considerations. However, the United States currently faces the highest Covid-19 victims globally, even higher than the People's Republic of China, where this Covid-19 originated. According to its name, Covid-19, or what people know as Corona, has become a great epidemic, which comes from the word crown (crown) because it is shaped like a crown. However, it turns out that this crown is one that everyone should avoid. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared Covid-19 a global pandemic. Pandemic comes from the Greek pan, which means wide; by or demos, it means people. It is said that this is because the pandemic has reached between countries and between continents. As a result of this broad reach, it dramatically impacts the humanity of countries worldwide. Not only humanity in the economic sector will be affected, the threat of recession in the world's countries is sure to occur before our eyes, as predicted by World Bank (World Bank) and International Monetary Fund (IMF) that 2020 will make the country's economic growth minus due to Covid-19. This prediction is not without reason because it has seen various micro and macro calculations; policies are needed to save the affected communities. This impacts humanity and the economy due to the Covid-19 Pandemic. The impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic has been felt especially in the economic instability of the community, including Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Most MSMEs have generally experienced a decline in income and even bankruptcy due to the Covid-19 pandemic (Sugiarti, Sari, & Hadiyat, 2020). Based on it, a strategy is needed for MSMEs to survive and develop their business during the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the main aspects that impact MSME actors significantly is the decrease in sales, which puts the MSME's financial condition in a crisis. Restrictions on social activities make it difficult for MSMEs to develop their business scale if they only use conventional methods. Business actors have taken various ways to respond to this challenging condition to maintain their business. One step SMEs can take is to exploit digital marketing, especially in increasing social media marketing, online advertising, and video marketing. By exploiting marketing digitalisation, MSME actors are expected to be able to increase sales and online engagement to develop business scale amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Nadya (2016) explains that accuracy in choosing media that follows technological developments, by consumer behaviour tendencies in electronic media, gives opinions that give rise to consideration for other potential consumers to make purchases. Entrepreneurs commonly use digital marketing to introduce products/services widely through digital media. In addition to product/service promotion, digital marketing can also increase sales, build relationships with customers, and reach as many consumers as possible in a relevant, personal, and efficient manner (Sunardi et al., 2021). Digital marketing is a more prospective strategy because it allows potential customers to obtain product information and transact online (Purwana et al., 2017). Makmur and Ahmed, Digital-Based Sales Transformation in Strengthening Economic Resilience  96  One economic force that has supported the state and regional economy is the presence of micro, small, and medium enterprises (SMEs) (Mohamad Trio Febriyantoro & Arisandi, 2018). SMEs still own the problem of competing. One of the problems faced is the need for more ability to do marketing (Susanto & et al., 2020). Research related to digital-based sales transformation is fundamental (urgent) during and after the global pandemic that is happening not only in Indonesia but also in other countries. Moreover, the economic shock that occurred to sellers needed economic resilience that could survive in the era of shocks during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. This research conducted a study in Surabaya, the city with the second largest population in Indonesia and a relatively high level of economic mobility.  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  Shank (2002) defines qualitative research as “a form of systematic empirical inquiry into meaning”. By systematic he means “planned, ordered and public”, following rules agreed upon by members of the qualitative research community (Danugroho, 2020). By empirical, he means that this type of inquiry is grounded in the world of experience. Inquiry into meaning says researchers try to understand how others make sense of their experience. Denzin and Lincoln (2000) claim that qualitative research involves an interpretive and naturalistic approach: “This means that qualitative researchers study things in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or to interpret, phenomena in terms of the meanings people bring to them”. This study uses a qualitative approach. Design The research used in this study is phenomenology. Qualitative research data is descriptive; this data is presented in words, pictures, and tables at the research location used in Surabaya City, East Java Province. The informants of this research were determined using purposive sampling chosen with specific considerations and goals. Data collection techniques used in this study were observation, in-depth interviews, focus group discussion (FGD), and documentation. This study conducted interviews with 5 sellers with various types of merchandise, there were vegetable traders, fruit traders, fried food traders, snack traders, and clothes traders. Analysis of the data used is based on the results of interviews and phenomenology that occurred in the field.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The market is part of the community's social life, whose growth and development are adjusted to the customary norms of a region. Then, the market becomes an economic activity that sustains and facilitates the community's needs. Economic activity is a meeting place for sellers and buyers. Judging from its development, the market can be interpreted as an institution or institution managed by the government so that trade transactions can occur properly. In a more modern sense, the market is a mechanism that allows supply and demand to meet physically and non-physical. The market, in its activities apart from fulfilling the needs of its environment, in this case, the people who need goods and services, has other broader functions, such as an opinion that the market can become a regional icon, Setiyanto (in Djau, 2009). Departing from this, the market, Antroposen : Journal of Social Studies and Humaniora Vol. 2, No. 2, Desember 2023: 93-104, DOI 10.33830/antroposen.v2i2.5511 97  which initially used methods that prioritised instinct in the transaction process with prospective buyers, should have placed its position on an equal footing with the modern market by using a good management strategy, given the rapid development of technology, information, and innovation, but that inconsistent with the market itself. By prioritising special considerations to improve overall quality for added value to products and services, it becomes essential for balanced competition in transforming the market in this free trade era. The market for some people can be a place to do "Charging Station," with high social interaction between buyers and sellers. The market is a picture of various human characters and various human needs. In the market, people can sell leisurely walks to buy daily necessities. The market also offers lower prices than other stores such as Hypermart, Indomaret, Freshmart, and other official stores. The Covid-19 pandemic, of course, impacted the continuity of transactions on the market due to limitations and the lockdown in Indonesia. During the Covid-19 pandemic, people became afraid to do activities outside the home. This also ultimately has an impact on the habit of transacting online. So this research will discuss and thoroughly peel how sales are transformed in the Citraland modern market during the Covid-19 pandemic and after the Covid-19 pandemic. The market usually consists of stalls opened by sellers, and most of them sell daily needs such as food ingredients in the form of fish, vegetables, eggs, meat, and others the function and role of the market in trading foodstuffs in a small town or a considerable area. Many city and district governments are trying to maintain market existence through revitalisation and renovation efforts. In traditional and modern markets, traders and buyers must be for transactions to occur. Traders have the term person or institution that trades products or goods directly or indirectly to consumers. Traders according to economic sociology, traders are based on the use and management of income generated from trade and its relationship with the family economy. In this writing, in East Java Province, precisely in West Surabaya, there is also a market that gathers all the traders, from sellers of fruit, vegetables, meat, other necessities, even clothes, and school supplies. This market is known as the Citraland Fresh Mart market. The Citraland Fresh Market is the central market for the people of West Surabaya, especially the Tongue Kulon, Tongue Wetan, and Lontar areas. This market will be very crowded from 5 am to 11 am. Traders: The Angso duo market has two market blocks: Block C and Block D, with 80 traders with various commodities traded (East Java Province Industry and Trade Office, 2021). We can all understand that during the Covid-19 pandemic, there was paralysis and a slowdown in economic processes in all access to human life. This is especially the case for business owners, including market traders. Traders complained about the lack of income and losses they experienced because of a fast-spreading virus from Wuhan, China, the coronavirus, better known as Covid-19. Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by respiratory syndrome acute coronavirus 2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two or SARS-CoV-2). Since the emergence of the Covid-19 disease outbreak at the end of 2019, it has spread worldwide. In this Covid-19 condition, many consumers prefer to avoid leaving their homes for fear of contracting Covid-19, resulting in reduced purchasing power of the people and decreased sales Makmur and Ahmed, Digital-Based Sales Transformation in Strengthening Economic Resilience  98  volume turnover, receipts, and income of traders. Due to Covid-19, the government has imposed Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB).tocommunity in Jambi. Implementing the PSBB will reduce public interest in buying and selling activities at markets and other outdoor activities.  Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) Coronavirus (Covid-19) is a new virus that spread in 2020; this virus is a new type of virus (SARS-CoV-2) whose disease is called Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). The rapid spread of this virus resulted in social and economic problems that occurred in almost all parts of the world, including Indonesia. Almost all of Indonesia's territory is experiencing social and economic changes. As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic virus, the economy experienced a decrease in income, especially market traders, who experienced a 50% decrease in turnover and income. Moreover, regarding the impact caused by Covid-19, it does not only affect urban communities but has spread to remote villages. This impacts micro, small, and medium enterprises in rural areas, including the Citraland market. Income decreased, and the prices of goods increased/expensive, resulting in a decrease in household consumption and investment, both within the household and government spheres. Moreover, it reduced shopping activities outside the home. This has an impact on small traders. Likewise, small businesses in the Citraland market result in low buying and selling rates because many residents no longer shop there. It becomes a threat to traders, minimal traders, and the impact is a decrease in the income of traders in the Citraland market. A pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that spreads sexuallyubiquitous, covering a large geographical area. A pandemic is an epidemic that has spread to almost all countries or continents and usually affects many people. An increase in the number of diseases above normal usually occurs; this disease also occurs suddenly in the population of a particular geographic area. Coronavirus Disease (Covid-19) is caused by a newly discovered coronavirus known as acute or severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavirus is a type of disease that humans have not previously identified; this virus can be transmitted from human to human through frequent close contact; people with a high risk of contracting these 15 diseases are people who have close contact with Covid-19 patients, namely doctors and nurses. The Covid-19 pandemic is an outbreak of an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus that attacks the human respiratory tract and can cause death; this disease can affect anyone and is now happening everywhere. The disease originated in the Wuhan area of China and has now spread to many countries, including Indonesia. According to Wellness And Health Magazine, the Coronavirus is a positive single-strain RNA virus, encapsulated and not segmented. Coronaviruses belong to the order Nidovirales,Coronaviridae family. The structure of coronavirus forms a cube-like structure with the S protein located on the virus's surface. S protein or spike protein is one of the leading viral antigen proteins and is the main structure for gene writing. This S protein plays a role in the attachment and entry of the virus into the host cell (protein S interaction with its receptors in the host cell. Coronavirus is sensitive to heat and can be effectively inactivated by disinfectants Antroposen : Journal of Social Studies and Humaniora Vol. 2, No. 2, Desember 2023: 93-104, DOI 10.33830/antroposen.v2i2.5511 99  containing chlorine, lipid solvents at 56 ̊ for 30 minutes, ether, alcohol, peroxyacetic acid, non-ionic detergents, formalin, oxidising agents, and chloroform. Chlorhexidine is ineffective in deactivating viruses (Wang, 2020; Korsman, 2012).  Analysis of Changes in Sales Strategy During Covid-19 Pandemic and Post-Covid-19 Pandemic Adapting and implementing information and communication technology in the economic sector is inevitable. The application of Information and Communication Technology is not only monopolised by certain groups or high-class business people but has become a necessity for all groups now. However, it becomes an obstacle for business people who have yet to be able to adapt and implement information and communication technology in their business. Of the many concerns experienced by business actors, this is due to several factors/impacts that affect sales. For this reason, after conducting interviews with the authors, few people or business actors have experienced the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has caused reduced income. However, in the Citraland market of Surabaya, traders have the ability and desire to survive with new delivery strategies, online orders and maximising the use of applications like Whatsapp. As stated by said a fresh fruit seller, initially, sales during Covid-19 did decline because customers wanted to avoid interacting directly in the market. However, took action, door to door, a way to trade the fruit she sold, as customers would be able to order through Whatsapp. Apart from that, also opened an online shop through e-commerce to sell her wares during covid. At the Citraland market, traders did not close their wares during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, traders had to implement health protocols such as administering vaccines, using masks, washing their hands with running water, and selling food, fruit, and vegetables; traders were protected by placing plastic covers and maintaining distance from merchants. Another trader, the vegetables seller said, who sells vegetables and crackers, also said that Covid-19 revealed that his buyers increased during the Covid-19 pandemic because what he sold were vegetables which carry antioxidants strengthening, became a higher demand as it would prevent coronavirus. However, this happened because the vegetables seller brought innovations and new sales strategies by providing accessible delivery facilities to customers who bought vegetables at his place. Besides, the vegetables seller provided the best service by providing high-quality fresh vegetables. If traders are in the fruit and vegetable sector, their sales are not affected. Instead, they get more customers by selling ingredients needed to maintain a healthy body during the covid-19 pandemic. The difference is with clothing and household items such as toys. Covid-19 has severely impacted the fashion sector, the manufacturers and markets as consumers would have only stayed indoors. Clothes Seller said, a clothing seller in the Citraland market, was slightly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. She had only relied on offline sales in the market and kept her strategy the same as online sales. She had kept her marketing strategy the same during Covid and depended on customers visiting her market. During the Covid-19 pandemic, only got five customers/per day, whereas, before the pandemic, she could get 12 customers/per day. However, after the Covid-19 pandemic decreased, she returned to have a normal amount of customers, even with conventional Makmur and Ahmed, Digital-Based Sales Transformation in Strengthening Economic Resilience  100  trading strategies. Apart from that, she sells various market snacks such as lupis, porridge, and milkfish. She had also experienced the same thing as Mrs Lily because the trade was carried out only conventionally, which usually could be 80 customers/per day. However, during the Covid pandemic, she only got 30 customers/per day. Days even after the Covid-19 pandemic started to return to normal. Next, the fried food seller, who sells fried bananas, bakwan, and other fried foods, admits there was no impact from the Covid-19 pandemic because the market continues to operate as usual with no significant decrease or increase in customers. Customers continue to buy wares in the same quantity as before the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the fried food seller continues to take preventive measures by self-vaccinating, wearing masks, and maintaining a safe distance from customers during sales transactions. Most food traders must take on health measures for Covid for the health of the consumers and them. They do this by vaccination, wearing masks and gloves when handing out their products, using plastic to cover the food, and maintaining social distance from their customers. During a pandemic like now, sellers in the market must be able to make good use of technology, think creatively, and have a strategy for marketing the goods they sell so that they sell quickly and make a profit; without having a decrease in customers. See table 1.                         Antroposen : Journal of Social Studies and Humaniora Vol. 2, No. 2, Desember 2023: 93-104, DOI 10.33830/antroposen.v2i2.5511 101   Table 1. Seller Data and Types of Sales Fishmonger Vegetable seller Fruit Seller Clothes Seller The strategy fish sellers use in marketing their wares is promoting them through word of mouth. Because the fish traders in the market, when they sell their wares, they call consumers who pass by. Because that is how they attract buyers. Moreover, the strategy in selling is by calling consumers; if there are consumers who ask for prices, they bargain with each other so that their merchandise runs out quickly and by giving discounts.30 For example, buy five, get one free. However, much that I found in the field during research, many sellers could be more friendly to buyers. For example, being bargained for at this price, some do not like to be haggled, even though haggling is common in buying and selling. Supposedly, a seller must remain friendly to the buyer because the buyer is the king. The strategy used by vegetable sellers in their marketing is to carry out a strategy that includes four components: product, price, place, and promotion. This marketing strategy is known as the 4Ps. The following is an explanation of the 4P marketing strategy as follows: ● Product Strategy (Product). The quality of vegetable products is vital in marketing. The quality of these vegetable products can be seen from the appearance of fresh vegetables and good shelf life. ● Price Strategy (Price). Determination of the selling price of vegetables must be considered carefully. Setting the wrong price will affect the profit of this vegetable business. Regarding pricing, it is better to know the target market for vegetable products is better. ● Strategy Place (Place). This is related to the location of marketing, which can be marketed in traditional markets and marketing locations that buyers easily find. ● Promotion Strategy (Promotion). Promotion is related to how vegetable businesses win the hearts of consumers. Promotion is essential to introduce this vegetable product. Ways of promotion can be done by giving discounts. For example, if a consumer shopping at a vegetable seller's place with quite a lot of groceries, the seller gives a discount or adds the vegetables he has. The 4P marketing strategy can be a reference in marketing vegetable products. The marketing strategy is expected to be able to meet the objectives of a business so that profits and no losses will be generated so that they can turn their capital back. Who doesn't love fruit? In addition to their fresh taste, fruits are also rich in health benefits. No wonder fruits are mandatory for most people after a heavy meal. Moreover, what we have to pay attention to in the fruit business is as follows: ● Selling quality fruits ● The fruits sold must be of high quality, such as fresh, sweet, and clean. Never sell shrivelled fruit because looking at it makes you no longer interested, let alone eating it; most buyers like what they see. Make sure the fruit looks attractive on the outside and friendly on the inside. ● Appropriate fruit layout The right arrangement can increase the attractiveness of buyers. Therefore, arrange the fruit as neatly as possible even though the selling place is just sitting or using a basket. Because most of the markets that sell fruit use baskets. In addition, pay attention to the packaging of the fruit. Ensure it is neat, not overlapping one fruit and another so that the fruit is not dented when the buyer brings it home. ● Have self-confidence Stay motivated in running a fruit business; it has called business, Certainly only sometimes crowded with buyers.  Marketing is one of the keys to success in a company or business. The quality of the product must also be determined so that the marketing strategy can be developed. In making a marketing strategy, product information and observations of the market to be determined are needed. Moreover, one of the strategies of clothing sellers in marketing their wares is as follows: ● By doing promotions They are creatively introducing our products and quality to consumers so that the products we sell attract consumers. We can introduce it through social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, or word of mouth. Because usually, traders in the market sell mostly by offering their wares to everyone who passes in front of their wares. In addition, they promote it by uploading their wares to social media so that many people can see them. If consumers are interested in these items, buyers can immediately stop by the market to see firsthand the items being offered by the seller. Moreover, we can also attract consumers by providing discounts to attract consumers' purchasing power. ● Choose a Strategic Location   (Resources : Data Collection Researcher, 2023)   Makmur and Ahmed, Digital-Based Sales Transformation in Strengthening Economic Resilience  102  During the Covid-19 Pandemic VS After the Covid-19 Pandemic The covid-19 pandemic has become a culture shock for Indonesia; his presence changed the community's many ways of life, habits, and communication (Yongki & Leon, 2021). The Covid-19 pandemic forces us to use technology to move from conventional to international ways. Those who can adapt will get many conveniences and survive during the covid-19 pandemic, while those who cannot adapt will only worsen and even suffer huge losses. During the Covid-19 pandemic, traders have made further efforts to develop their businesses through changes in marketing methods to increase income (Bismala, 2016). From this condition, business actors must have a solution or strategy to maintain their business. In this era of globalisation, business actors must address this by implementing strategic steps for business continuity. The emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, which hit almost all over the world, resulted in paralysis of all joints of life, such as the economy, which resulted in restrictions on activities outside the home. The Covid-19 pandemic, which has been going on for about two years in Indonesia, has caused several businesses to experience a decline. This is undoubtedly a hard blow for traders. From this incident, business actors carried out the following marketing strategies: 1. Utilising Technology, Technology can be used to market a product or goods. Solid. In times of pandemic 2. Marketing Through Social Media, With so many social media users nowadays, there are lots of traders who use it for selling. Social media marketing is also an effective strategy for business success. Social media marketing is promoting (marketing) products or services using various social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook, or WhatsApp. MSMEs can use one of the social media platforms, and what is widely used by buyers is Facebook because both young, old and teenagers use Facebook. Therefore Facebook is a social media that is more appropriate to use. With social media several business actors promote their wares through social media such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. In this way, we can get consumers and customers. Moreover, technology is beneficial and essential because you can use it for sales and positive things. It is felt that the pandemic that has been running for almost two years in Indonesia has changed consumer shopping behaviour and trends. Most buying and selling transactions are now shifting to online/online transactions. Products previously purchased directly at the market are now purchased through websites or marketplaces, both primary and complementary needs. This is not an obstacle but an opportunity for small micro businesses. It should be understood that this also allows all micro and small businesses to start using information technology to expand the scope of consumers who can buy the goods being sold. Traders of market business actors must also have strategies in their respective areas of ability. From their strategy, they must have innovation because innovation is an idea that must be done creatively. For example: 1) Offers more affordable prices 2) Find a target that fits their needs Antroposen : Journal of Social Studies and Humaniora Vol. 2, No. 2, Desember 2023: 93-104, DOI 10.33830/antroposen.v2i2.5511 103  3) Promote merchandise through social media or word of mouth With the strategies above, it will be able to attract consumer purchasing power and benefit during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it must also be done with innovation and creativity. Now that the Covid-19 pandemic is over, there are still many stories and struggles to keep on living and survive. Society has now reached the point of transition and recovery of conditions, which is difficult.  CONCLUSION  Adapting and making changes using technology was vital. Traders needed to survive; one had changed their strategy with a new delivery system. As covid started, sales started to decline, but after these strategies were implemented, they increased again. Although not all traders had started an online app to promote themselves, in the case of a vegetable seller, they had carried out delivery facilities for their customers, also by providing fresh, high-quality vegetables. It was concluded that vegetable and fruit market traders were not heavily affected by the Covid pandemic. They had gotten even more customers as they had the goods, which allowed people to stay healthy during Covid. Snack vendors, although they had fewer customers daily. Covid has changed many communities, their way of life, habits, and general view of living. It caused technological growth and usage from more conventional and local to international. Markets that could easily adapt would benefit from those that cannot. After this pandemic, lasting for two years, businesses still have to keep up with marketing strategies for continuity and for the economy to be growing. This is done by utilising technology, especially through social media. With more awareness of social media worldwide, users, sellers and MSMEs can use these platforms and promote their businesses to target audiences and keep them alive. Many transactions are now online, and website product purchases are a great way for small entrepreneurs to thrive. Allowing markets to expand their customer base. However, sellers have also been innovative in their promotion methods, targets and prices. MSMEs had a rough time during the pandemic in many markets and businesses.
