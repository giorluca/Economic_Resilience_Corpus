Adapting Indian Copyright: 
Bollywood, Indian Cultural 
Adaptation, and the Path to Economic 
Development 
Michael P. Goodyear* 
ABSTRACT 
Bollywood and the Indian film industry have enjoyed enormous 
success, being among the largest movie producers in the world. Yet, 
despite the bright image of Indian cinema producing over a thousand 
movies a year and selling billions of tickets, the industry has faced 
controversy over the practice of copying expression, sometimes 
practically scene for scene, from US and other international films and 
adapting them into a version that reflects Indian social and cinematic 
customs and mores (“Indian cultural adaptation”). A long-standing 
practice, Indian cultural adaptation in Bollywood has only attracted the 
attention of Hollywood studios in the past twenty years, but under 
international, US, and Indian copyright law, the legality of the practice 
remains in an unsettled gray area. 
Current literature on Indian cultural adaptation remains sparse 
and focuses on greater enforcement by India or Hollywood studios, at 
least partially condemning the practice. This Article instead argues that 
the practice of Indian cultural adaptation at least partially aligns with 
other limitations on the scope of copyright, including the expression-idea 
distinction, fair use, and the scène à faire doctrine. Drawing on a 
growing trend in law and economic development literature to craft 
property rights on a country-by-country basis, this Article also argues 
that explicit legalization of limited Indian cultural adaptation would

I. INTRODUCTION 
India is a movie-mad country.1 In 2009 alone, the Indian film 
industry produced 1,200 films, employed 420,000 people, and sold 3 
billion tickets, far outstripping Hollywood on all these fronts.2 In 2017, 
Shah Rukh Khan, one of the greatest Bollywood actors, was the second 
wealthiest man in India.3 The Indian film industry—most synonymous

with Bollywood in Mumbai but also including other regional studios 
throughout the country—and its successes have led to international 
interest in the lucrative market.4 The films that are the basis of this 
Indian cinema market are replete with color, lights, and music. The 
often three-hour-long extravaganzas of Bollywood are punctuated with 
multiple plots and bright colors.5 No matter the genre, song-and-dance 
numbers interspersed throughout the film are key to Bollywood 
success.6  
Despite this bright picture of Indian film, it also has a more 
controversial side. The Indian film industry is frequently criticized for 
producing “cheap copies” of Hollywood movies.7 Indian producers have 
copied parts of Hollywood movies and other foreign films in Bollywood 
movies for decades, from copying mere unprotectable plot elements and 
scenes to practically shot-by-shot copyrightable expression.8 It is the 
latter adapting of copyrightable elements that is at issue in this Article. 
In Indian cinema, the origins of a specific expression of an idea have 
never been all that important nor has there been a premium on films 
being sui generis.9 Instead, Indian producers that draw “inspiration” 
from Hollywood movies do so to substantially adapt the movie into an 
Indian version that speaks directly to Indian cultural norms and issues, 
which the Hollywood original could never do.10 
This “Indian cultural adaptation”11 of Hollywood movies by the 
Bollywood film industry has been the subject of controversy for nearly 
two decades, since Hollywood first entered the Indian entertainment

market, although the practice is much older.12 Yet, despite the ink that 
has been spilled over the issue, it remains largely unresolved. Previous 
legal scholarship on Bollywood and copyright has focused on either the 
need for Bollywood to strictly adhere to the bounds of existing rights 
under copyright law,13 why Hollywood studios should enforce their 
rights more,14 or the futility of Hollywood litigating copyright disputes 
in India.15 This Article suggests that instead of strengthening copyright 
enforcement in India, Indian law should recognize and protect at least 
limited Indian cultural adaptation of expression as a carve-out from 
enforceable rights under copyright. This argument is grounded in US 
and Indian copyright law but is novel in that it also draws upon the 
perspective of law and economic development. While law and economic 
development scholarship has largely focused on the benefits of 
strengthening property rights, this Article joins a growing body of 
literature that instead suggests that optimal property rights should be 
determined on a country-by-country basis, especially in developing 
countries.16 
In Part II, this Article sets the stage by explaining the current 
controversy over copying Hollywood films in Bollywood as well as the 
use of Indian cultural adaptation. Part III explains copyright under 
international, US, and Indian law before examining and concluding 
that Indian cultural adaptation is left in an unclear gray area of legality 
and that, due to additional factors, copyright enforcement litigation by 
Hollywood would be a poor tactical choice. Part IV introduces the state 
of property rights under law and economic development scholarship, 
showing that despite the strength of property rights for economic 
development, a growing body of scholarship favors a country-by-country 
application. Having set the foundation of copyright and economic 
development principles, Part V then develops the core analysis of this 
Article. This Part proffers that Indian cultural adaptation is a key 
principle in Bollywood’s success, and makes the legal argument for why 
Indian cultural adaptation fits within the historical framework of 
copyright exceptions and would provide cultural benefits for India. The 
final Parts of this Article then look at the success of Bollywood versus

the failure of Hollywood in India, ultimately suggesting that foreign 
investment from Hollywood bridge the gap and that legalization of 
Indian cultural adaptation would provide a significant bargaining chip 
for Bollywood studios to negotiate on more favorable grounds. 
II. COPYRIGHT AND INSPIRATION TROUBLES IN BOLLYWOOD 
The Indian film industry, headlined by the Mumbai studios of 
“Bollywood,” has long produced “cultural copies”—near replications of a 
film or other work from one culture to another.17 Indeed, the Indian film 
industry has thrived on adapting expression from Hollywood movies 
into Indian cultural and cinematic norms.18 Even some of Bollywood’s 
biggest hits, such as Bang Bang (allegedly a copy of the Hollywood 
movie Knight and Day), have been implicated as mere Hindi language 
copies of previous movies.19 In the early 2000s, nearly eight out of ten 
scripts in Bollywood were “inspired,” to some degree, by Hollywood 
films.20 One Indian film critic estimated that “[e]asily 60 percent of the 
movies—almost one film that releases every week—is either blatantly 
copied or inspired by some fairly big American film.”21  
“Indian cultural adaptation” is defined as adding Indian 
elements to preexisting expression to create a new film specifically for 
Indian audiences.22 In Indian films, the process of culturally adapting a 
work is threefold: (1) adding “emotions” through the addition of social 
life; (2) expanding the narrative by including parallel or subplots; and 
(3) inserting songs.23 In particular, culturally adapting a film includes 
adding a star-studded Bollywood cast, further expanding the narrative 
by including additional emotional themes relevant to Indian culture, 
adding song-and-dance scenes, and introducing kinship ties.24 
Traditional Hindi films are unique from American ones: they are much

longer, include hefty doses of song and dance, plenty of color, and often 
combine a variety of genres, such as action, love, drama, and comedy.25 
In their original forms, Hollywood films would be a poor fit for 
audiences in India due to the lack of these three necessary elements.26 
Perhaps the best known aspect of Bollywood films, the spontaneous 
songs and accompanying dances in exotic locales are critical for Indian 
film success due to consumer demand for these elements that have 
traditionally held center stage in Indian movies; very few Hindi films 
without such songs become box office hits.27 Indeed, this process of 
Indian cultural adaptation builds on what would be a poor release in 
India and turns it into a lucrative masterpiece. Indian film producers 
adapt Hollywood and other international movies on purpose, using 
proven successful expression and a viable candidate for successful 
adaptation to reduce the risks of box office failure.28  
There is a long history of Indian cinema making cultural  
copies of Hollywood classics. To name but a few more prominent 
examples: Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai (2002) is alleged to be a copy of My 
Best Friend’s Wedding (1997); Rafoo Chakkar (1974) is a copy of Some 
Like It Hot (1959); Dil Hain Ke Manta Nahin (1992) is supposedly an 
Indian version of It Happened One Night (1934).29 The 2002 Bollywood 
film Kaante was blasted by the press for supposedly taking too much 
from Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs: “the producers simply stole 
their plot.”30 The fact that Indian filmmakers draw on Hollywood for 
inspiration is not disputed; indeed, they themselves readily admit it.31 
Some directors even show the original American movie to their actors 
in order for them to properly execute the scene.32 The common response 
of Bollywood’s producers and directors is that their works were 
“inspired” by other works.33 In the past, Hollywood’s lack of interest in 
the Indian entertainment industry convinced Indian producers that 
relying on Hollywood movies for “inspiration” would not attract

copyright suits. However, with the growth of Hollywood in India, so 
grew Hollywood studios’ awareness of Indian movies’ “inspiration.”34  
The amount of copying can vary from mere unprotectable plots 
and ideas to practically scene-for-scene copies of expression. The former 
do not fall afoul of copyright law, but the latter are in a gray area of 
lawfulness that depends on the level of abstraction of the expression. In 
these latter cases, despite what would many times constitute clear cases 
of copyright infringement, Hollywood long stayed away from pursuing 
claims against Bollywood studios even after they became aware of likely 
copyright infringement.35 Hollywood had previously ignored Indian film 
studios’ copyright infringement because they did not consider it a 
challenge; Indian movies were traditionally distinct and the market 
was not seen as all that profitable.36 That changed when India was 
opened up to foreign direct investment (FDI), and Hollywood started to 
invest directly in Indian film ventures at the same time that the Indian 
economy was growing.37 There have still been few litigated cases over 
this issue in India,38 but the number has been growing since 2008. In 
particular, Hollywood studios started to pursue copyright infringement 
litigation against Bollywood producers due to the rapid increase in 
Bollywood’s profitability, India’s overall economic boom, and the 
audiences of both groups of studios starting to overlap.39 
Today, the question of whether Indian cultural adaptation is 
copyright infringement remains unsettled. There is undoubtedly some 
copying taking place, but there continues to be genuine disagreement 
on whether the added Indian cultural and cinematic norms and 
elements are sufficient to transform expression into an entirely new 
work.40 No doubt there are a range of potential results, but is Indian 
cultural adaptation necessarily a violation of copyright law? 
III. COPYRIGHT LAW 
To understand how Bollywood’s cultural adaptation of films is 
understood in a legal context, it is first important to understand the 
current laws on copyright infringement. The goal of copyright is to 
promote new and improved works by offering authors exclusive

intellectual property protection over their works for a limited period of 
time.41 First, international law, binding on both the United States and 
India, provides a background to the copyright enforcement obligations 
of both countries. This Article then summarizes the relevant provisions 
of US and Indian copyright law. Finally, using aspects of both countries’ 
copyright laws, it turns to Indian cultural adaptation and determines 
that its legality is highly fact specific and it does have potentially viable 
copyright defenses. 
A. International Law 
The primary international compliance mechanism for copyright 
is the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights (TRIPS). The World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Uruguay 
Round resulted in the signing of the comprehensive Marrakesh 
Agreement in 1994 that included the various constituent documents of 
the WTO Agreement, including TRIPS.42 Both the United States and 
India are signatories.43 TRIPS covers the protection of intellectual 
property, including copyrights.44 The agreement imposes an obligation 
of establishing minimum levels of protection for other States Parties’ 
intellectual property and following the national treatment principle, by 
which citizens of other States Parties are treated the same as a 
country’s own citizens.45  
Perhaps most importantly, TRIPS incorporates the two previous 
leading international intellectual property agreements, the Paris 
Convention and the Berne Convention, and binds WTO signatories to 
them.46 While the Paris and Berne Conventions do not have an 
enforcement mechanism,47 TRIPS does, mandating certain civil and

criminal enforcement procedures for copyright infringement.48 It also 
creates a private cause of action for copyright violations, which allows 
the copyright owner to file suit directly in the State Party’s courts.49 
Furthermore, disputes about the enforcement of TRIPS obligations are 
subject to international enforcement through the WTO’s Dispute 
Settlement Understanding (DSU).50 The punishment for persistent 
violation of a State Party’s TRIPS obligations is retaliation in the form 
of a punitive tariff.51 While there are concerns about countries refusing 
to comply with their TRIPS obligations,52 TRIPS does establish 
international rules for enforcing copyright infringement by integrating 
the Berne Convention.53 
Of particular note in the context of Bollywood, TRIPS protects 
the exclusive right of authors to adapt their works while rejecting the 
protection of ideas. Article 12 of the Berne Convention provides that 
“[a]uthors of literary or artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of 
authorizing adaptations, arrangements and other alterations of their 
works.”54 However, TRIPS and the Berne Convention do not protect 
“ideas, procedures, methods of operation or mathematical concepts as 
such.”55 While TRIPS and the incorporated Berne and Paris 
Conventions provide broader obligations for states rather than detailed 
specifics, the space between a protected adaptation under copyright and 
an idea is critical to understanding whether Bollywood’s productions 
infringe Hollywood’s copyrights. 
B. United States 
Copyright law in the United States fits inside this TRIPS 
framework, protecting adaptations while permitting free use of ideas.

US copyright law is governed by the amended Copyright Act of 1976, 
which is codified as Title 17 of the US Code. Under US copyright law, 
the copyright owner has the exclusive right to prepare derivative works 
of their copyrighted work.56 A derivative work, like an adaptation, is 
one based upon a preexisting work.57 But Title 17 does not provide 
protection under copyright for “any idea, procedure, process, system, 
method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery.”58 
In the United States, to prove infringement, the owner of a 
copyrighted work must show that there was (1) copying and (2) copying 
of enough copyright-protected elements.59 The United States uses a 
two-part analysis for the second prong. To determine if there was 
improper appropriation, courts first examine whether there was 
copying of copyright-protected elements rather than copying of 
unprotectable elements, and then they investigate whether there was 
enough copying for it to be substantial.60 Circuit courts have employed 
slightly different tests for appropriation; for example, the US Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit’s test requires a heightened, more 
discerning observer test for determining whether there was copying of 
copyrighted elements and an ordinary observer test for determining 
whether enough of the work was copied for it to be a substantial use of 
the work.61 The logic behind this infringement test is that unauthorized 
derivative works are considered dangerous to society if they are so 
similar to the original that they will adversely affect the demand for the 
original.62 
In addition to the TRIPS provisions on adaptations and ideas, 
Title 17 also provides for the important carve-out of fair use. Fair

use is the most significant defense to copyright infringement in US  
law. To determine if a use is fair, the test under § 107 looks at four 
factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use; (2) the nature of  
the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion 
used; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market.63  
The Supreme Court has also placed particular emphasis on the 
transformativeness of fair use, which is considered under the first 
factor, noting that the transformativeness of works “lie[s] at the heart 
of the fair use doctrine” and “the more transformative the new work, 
the less will be the significance of other factors . . . that may weigh 
against a finding of fair use.”64 While transformativeness is the primary 
consideration,65 all of the factors are weighed in determining fair use on 
a case-by-case basis.66 
The other important principle in US copyright law for the 
purpose of evaluating Bollywood is the scène à faire doctrine. Under US 
copyright law, common tropes or elements are not copyrightable and 
can be used by everyone.67 Under this doctrine, there is no copyright 
protection for “those expressions that are standard, stock, or common 
to a particular topic or that necessarily follow from a common theme or 
setting.”68 Perhaps the most conspicuous example of a scène à faire 
would be the star-crossed lovers theme of Romeo and Juliet.69 The scène 
à faire argument has thus far been inadequately explored in connection 
to Bollywood.70 However, scène à faire is critical to understanding 
whether Bollywood impermissibly copies Hollywood movies, as many 
plots could be so common as to be considered scènes à faire.

Also a signatory of TRIPS, India, like the United States, protects 
adaptations but not ideas. India’s copyright laws are codified in the 
Copyright Act of 1957.71 The Indian Copyright Act of 1957, after it was 
amended in 1999, is in full compliance with TRIPS’s copyright law 
obligations.72 Under the Copyright Act of 1957, copyright owners have 
the exclusive right to make copies and adaptations of their work, among 
other rights.73 Akin to the US definition of a derivative work, India 
defines an adaptation as “in relation to any work, the use of such work 
involving its rearrangement or alteration.”74 Unlike US copyright law 
and TRIPS, Indian copyright law also grants authors moral rights, 
which include the right of authorship and the right to prevent 
alterations that would harm the author’s reputation.75 The Indian 
Copyright Act also protects only the original expression of an idea, not 
the idea itself.76  
In its seminal copyright decision, R.G. Anand v. Delux Films,  
the Indian Supreme Court upheld the expression-idea distinction.77  
The author of a play sued a production company for making a  
movie “entirely based” on his play. However, the Supreme Court held 
that “mere similarities by themselves are not sufficient to raise in  
[sic] inference of colourable imitation [and] on the other hand, there are 
quite a number of dissimilarities.”78 Using this balancing test, the

2021] CULTURAL ADAPTATION IN BOLLYWOOD 529 
Supreme Court determined that the movie did not infringe on the play’s 
copyright.79 The court particularly focused on six dissimilarities in the 
works that were different cultural themes such as dowries, which it 
held rendered the film noninfringing.80 While the Indian Supreme 
Court held that “[t]here can be no copyright in an idea, subject matter, 
themes, plots or historical or legendary facts,” it also emphasized that 
“violation of the copyright in such cases is confined to the form, manner 
and arrangement and expression of the idea by the author of the 
copyright[ed] work.”81 
Indian courts have adopted the “lay [or ordinary] observer” test 
for copyright infringement, wherein “after having read or seen both the 
works [the observer] is clearly of the opinion and gets an unmistakable 
impression that the subsequent work appears to be a copy of the 
original.”82 The similarity in the “copy must be a substantial and 
material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant 
is guilty of an act of piracy.”83 Even after passing the lay observer test 
for similarity, a copyright infringement suit must still prove a causal 
connection of intended or subconscious reliance.84 One example of such 
a finding was in Zee Telefilms, where the Bombay High Court held that 
there was copyright infringement in the theme of a television show 
about the deity Kanhaiyya coming down to Earth.85 This case was 
between two Indian parties and involved an obscene amount of access, 
as the plaintiff had met with and sent ideas and a pilot episode to the 
defendant on multiple occasions.86 The sheer degree of access made it 
impossible for the court “to accept that the similarities in two works 
were mere coincidence.”87 
India also has both fair use and scène à faire. Indian fair use, or 
“fair dealing” as it is called in India, differs from US fair use in that 
specific uses are exempted under the Copyright Act of 1957.88 The 
definition of fair dealing includes three specific purposes, and is 
included in a list of thirty exceptions, many of which are also included

in separate provisions in Title 17 of the US Code.89 The most relevant 
to Bollywood is the first exception: “a fair dealing with a literary, 
dramatic, musical or artistic work for the purposes of—(i) research or 
private study; (ii) criticism or review, whether of that work or of any 
other work.”90 The Indian courts have adopted the scène à faire doctrine 
as well, along the same lines as in the United States.91 
D. Is Indian Cultural Adaptation an Infringement? 
Like many legal answers, the answer to whether Indian cultural 
adaptation is copyright infringement is “it depends.” While there are 
minor differences between US and Indian copyright law, as detailed 
above, they are substantially similar in regard to the three primary 
considerations when looking at whether Indian cultural adaptation  
is copyright infringement: (1) the expression-idea distinction; (2) fair 
use; and (3) scène à faire.  
First, both US and Indian law leave open the question of where 
exactly the line between mere plot inspiration and too much copying 
(i.e., copying expression) lies. Indian courts have held that being a 
cultural copy of another work is not necessarily copyright 
infringement.92 The discrepancy comes in how far one can take the idea 
down a similar expression path without violating copyright law. The 
Indian Supreme Court has drawn a distinction between idea and 
expression, noting that “you can borrow the idea of another author, but 
not the expression.”93 The court further noted that “even if the plot is 
copied, the person who copies it, be it consciously or unconsciously, must 
also weave into the plot sufficient creations of his own imagination and 
literary skill, to make the work his own.”94 In India, culturally adapting 
another work to make it fit within Indian cultural and cinema 
conventions is commonly accepted by the public as valid under 
copyright.95 Of course, it is important to note that the lay observer test 
in Indian courts is from the perspective of a lay Indian observer. Would 
the average Indian, seeing two movies, one American and one culturally

2021] CULTURAL ADAPTATION IN BOLLYWOOD 531 
adapted to Indian culture, think they are similar enough for one to be a 
copy?96 Bollywood producers have been confident that the Indian public 
would not, given the centrality of Indian cultural elements in films to 
Indian moviegoers. For example, in the first threatened copyright 
infringement suit by Hollywood against Bollywood, Sony claimed that 
Bollywood’s Hitch was a copy of its earlier movie Partner.97 The 
production company that produced Hitch, K Sera Sera, responded that 
while it had been “inspired” by Partner, it had culturally adapted 
Partner, and therefore Hitch could not be a copy.98 
Yet, under an ordinary observer test, there is little doubt that 
some of these Bollywood productions would be found to have infringed 
copyrights in Hollywood films, even in the eyes of an Indian observer. 
For example, Yeh Dillagi has practically the same elements as 
Hollywood’s Sabrina, with almost identical characters and plot 
development, just with different actors—the expression is almost 
completely the same.99 In another example, both the Bollywood Raaz 
and the Hollywood What Lies Beneath tell the story of a ghost of a young 
girl haunting a couple after she died due to a love affair with the 
husband.100 The copying of all of these elements makes it much more 
likely that a court would find copying of expression and not just ideas. 
The battle between expression and idea finally came to a head 
in 2010, when 20th Century Fox sued Sohail Maklai Entertainment for 
making the movie Knockout, which it claimed was an unlawful remake 
of their film Phone Booth.101 Both films centered around a hostage in a 
phone booth conversing with their captor.102 For the first time, an 
Indian court held that this “inspiration” was copyright infringement.103 
Using the lay observer test, the court found that “[t]here is little doubt 
that a person seeing both the films at different times would come to the 
unmistakable conclusion that the Defendants’ film is a copy.”104 One 
Indian law firm predicted that this decision would obliterate the veneer

of “inspiration.”105 But despite this prediction, and the number of 
increasing copyright infringement cases, Bollywood’s utilization of 
Hollywood inspiration has continued. For example, the aforementioned 
Indian hit Bang Bang, an Indian cultural adaptation of Hollywood’s 
Knight and Day, was released in 2014, four years after the decision in 
Twentieth Century Fox.106 
Next, fair use is more favorable in the United States than in 
India to Indian cultural adaptation of movies. Culturally adapted 
Hollywood films would hardly qualify as criticism, the most likely 
category under India’s fair use test. But US courts, on the other hand, 
look at each dispute on a case-by-case basis, so it is difficult to predict 
the outcome of Bollywood infringement suits with any certainty. The 
four factors in the US fair use test appear to weigh against a finding of 
fair use for Indian cultural adaptations of Hollywood movies.107 The 
purpose is not directly commentary, but is telling the same story, and 
the Indian movies are commercial in nature; these facts weigh strongly 
against transformative use.108 However, the work is placed in a new 
context and for a new purpose—reaching a different audience—which 
could be transformative as creating “new expression, meaning, or 
message.”109 The amount taken is usually substantial, and, at the very 
least, the central plot and associated expression—the most important 
parts of a film—are taken from Hollywood movies.110 The effect of the 
use upon the potential market is likely the most beneficial factor for 
Bollywood directors, as they could show that their film is aimed at the

for one and a half minutes was fair use). However, this factor has not been found dispositive. See, 
e.g., Adjmi v. DLT Ent. Ltd., 97 F. Supp. 3d 512, 535 (S.D.N.Y. 2015) (finding that the play in 
question “is a highly transformative parody of the television series that, although it appropriates 
a substantial amount of Three’s Company, is a drastic departure from the original[,]” and is  
therefore fair use). 
2021] CULTURAL ADAPTATION IN BOLLYWOOD 533 
Indian movie market while the original Hollywood film was not, but 
this outcome is far from certain.111 
Conversely, one scholar has argued that “adaptations of 
Hollywood films barely [resemble the original screenplay] as they have 
been transformed, or ‘Indianized.’”112 It is undoubtedly true that adding 
Indian cultural elements such as songs, dances, cultural motifs, 
fashion, and colors changes the basic Hollywood expression of a plot. 
The question is whether this change is enough to be considered 
transformative under US law. This is part of the wider scholarly debate 
about Indian cultural adaptation. Some legal scholars have recognized 
the copying of Hollywood movie ideas and reproducing them in Indian 
films as copyright infringement.113 But several Indian legal experts 
have argued that Bollywood’s inspiration from Hollywood films does not 
constitute copyright infringement.114 
Finally, whether the copying would count as a scène à faire is 
also highly fact specific. If general themes were used, like in R.G. 
Anand, the work would almost certainly count as a scène à faire. But 
the degree of copying runs the gamut between the mere plot to 
wholescale expression of scenes.115 Ultimately, whether a film that 
draws on elements of a preexisting work will be considered infringing 
depends on the level of specific copying; using all the underlying 
elements would almost certainly be copying but merely pulling a few 
general plot ideas would more likely be unprotected scène à faire.116 The 
main Indian case to address the scène à faire doctrine with Bollywood 
copying was Bradford v. Sahara Media.117 In 2004, author Barbara 
Taylor Bradford sued Sahara Media for allegedly infringing the 
copyright in her book, Woman of Substance, in their new television 
series, Karishma – The Miracles of Destiny.118 The two works are both 
 
 111. The fourth factor was the most important factor for courts to consider in the United 
States following the Supreme Court’s decision in Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters., 
471 U.S. 539, 566 (1985), which stated that the fourth factor was “undoubtedly the single most 
important element of fair use,” but this factor has been partially tempered following the Supreme 
Court’s decision in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose, 510 U.S. 569, 578 (1994), which stressed that “[a]ll 
[factors] are to be explored, and the results weighed together, in light of the purposes of copyright.”

rags-to-riches stories that chronicle a woman’s rise from the bottom of 
society to become the head of an international corporation.119 The case 
eventually appeared before the Indian Supreme Court, but the court 
refused to uphold an injunction against the television show.120 The court 
determined that “the plaintiffs have no copyright over the central theme 
of a woman rising to power, or there being characters about her, like an 
old and sticking friend . . . a lover from the house where she was 
working, an Army [sic] husband and some other person whom she might 
have married or might have fallen in love with at sometime.”121 The 
Indian Supreme Court determined that all of these things were common 
elements and thus not protected under copyright, closely in line with 
the US scène à faire doctrine. 
While US and Indian copyright law allow for a degree of copying, 
it is unclear where Indian cultural adaptation falls. Whether 
Bollywood’s inspiration from Hollywood movies would count as 
copyright infringement remains unsettled and depends on case-by-case 
determinations rather than a clear, black-and-white answer.122 
Contrary to what some scholars have argued,123 the fact that aspects of 
the film are copied does not necessarily mean that there is copyright 
infringement—that depends on the level of abstraction and added 
elements to determine if this adaptation is of an idea or expression, fair 
use, or merely using a scène à faire. For now, this uncertainty is 
considered worth the risk by Bollywood studios, with Indian cultural 
adaptation continuing even after Sohail Maklai.  
E. Difficulties with Copyright Enforcement 
Even if Hollywood studios brought copyright infringement suits 
against Bollywood, they would face numerous challenges that might 
make them unsuccessful. Indian courts face substantial delays, their 
enforcement of copyright is sometimes lacking, and, perhaps most 
importantly, they offer limited avenues for recovery for copyright 
owners.

2021] CULTURAL ADAPTATION IN BOLLYWOOD 535 
First, India is known for substantial delays in its courts.124 As of 
June 2018, there were thirty-three million pending cases in Indian 
courts.125 This problem is not limited to the lower courts; as of June 
2019, there was a backlog of 58,669 cases in the Supreme Court.126 Some 
cases take up to a decade to be resolved.127 One Indian lawyer concluded 
that copyright infringement suits by Americans would be an uphill 
battle: “you need a terrific amount of time, money, and energy.”128 While 
Hollywood is not lacking in any of these, it still poses a daunting 
challenge, even to the mightiest of Hollywood studios. 
Second, while the Copyright Act of 1957 is in full compliance 
with TRIPS, potentially inadequate enforcement arises in the 
implementation of this law.129 The heavy docket discourages some 
courts from seriously addressing certain issues, such as copyright. As 
one Indian lawyer explained, “Indian judges, inundated with a wide 
range of civil criminal cases, were not always sympathetic to cases 
involving an intangible asset like copyright.”130 Even if there is bona 
fide copyright infringement, there is a risk, especially given the  
case-by-case nature of copyright infringement determinations, that 
Indian courts will not see it as such or might even be opposed to

Finally, relief for copyright infringement can be rather limited 
in India. Relief for copyright infringement in India can take the form  
of (1) an injunction, (2) damages, (3) forfeiture of infringing copies, or 
(4) account of profits.132 Damages are meant as a compensatory remedy

to give the copyright owner whatever they lost, which is usually what 
the license would have cost or lost sales.133 Indian courts could also 
award punitive damages in extraordinary cases.134 Account of profits is 
where the court, at its discretion and in combination with an injunction, 
awards actual profits from the copyright infringement to the copyright 
owner.135  
While these options seem on par with recovery for copyright 
infringement in the United States, the recovery of damages is extremely 
curtailed. While Indian copyright law does not have statutory damages 
like in the United States,136 if the infringement suit was successful, the 
infringer would still have to disgorge their profits, which could be an 
enormous amount in the film context.137 But it would be incredibly 
difficult to determine the damages created through the Indian cultural 
adaptation of a Hollywood movie and what that process took from the 
market of the original work.138 Profits are based on the percentage of 
profits derived from the actual copyright infringement,139 not added 
material. This makes it difficult to calculate the exact profits from the 
copied underlying Hollywood expression in Bollywood movies, 
discounting the added Indian elements and their market power in 
India. In addition, Indian courts have generally been reluctant to award 
large amounts of damages. The highest amount of damages for 
copyright infringement in India was in Microsoft v. Yogesh Popat, where 
the court only awarded 1.97 million Indian rupees (INR), or 28,500 US 
dollars (USD).140 The same is true for settlements. In 2009, 20th Century 
Fox sued India’s BR Films for Yeh Bindass Hai allegedly being a copy 
of My Cousin Vinny.141 The case ultimately settled out of court for USD 
200,000, even though BR Films had approached 20th Century Fox about

Given these limitations, pursuing copyright infringement suits 
is likely not the best use of Hollywood’s time and resources. Simply put, 
litigation is likely not the optimal way to end Bollywood’s copying.143 
IV. PROPERTY, LAW, AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
Despite the difficulties of litigating these copyright cases, there 
are benefits to clarifying the intellectual property standard for Indian 
cultural adaptation from a law and development perspective. This 
Article turns to those benefits in the following Part, but it is first 
important to understand the academic literature on property rights in 
relation to law and economic development. The overriding norm in 
economic and legal theory is that private property rights are essential 
to economic development. However, these norms are coming under siege 
in the contexts of both private and intellectual property. 
The idea that property rights greatly influence economic 
development extends back to Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations.144 This 
argument was embedded in economic understandings of development 
by Ronald Coase and the scholars that followed his Coase theorem—the 
idea that once property rights are defined, if there is competition, the 
market will best allocate that property towards the most economic 
use.145 The literature often takes it as a given that property rights are 
essential to economic development.146 Guaranteed property rights were 
seen as essential to preventing a despotic ruler from arbitrarily seizing 
assets.147 Economic development needs fixed capital, which will only 
happen if one’s property interests are secure and cannot be taken on a

capricious whim.148 Indeed, the development of more complex economic 
systems can be linked to increasing protection for property rights on a 
local, national, and then international level.149 Ultimately, private 
property rights were seen as essential to attracting investment and 
thus increasing economic performance.150 
Yet, while the importance of property rights for economic 
development is still largely upheld, it is starting to weaken. Outside 
factors such as poor or nonexistent related markets, initial costs, and 
different local and national customs can all undermine the significance 
of property rights in developing countries for economic growth.151 The 
adoption of private property rights can risk substantial monetary, 
social, and security costs.152 There is also proof that the framing of 
property rights can produce disparate outcomes for different developing 
countries.153 Given the dissimilarities between societies, some have 
argued that the best outcome of property rights for a society is highly 
dependent on local context.154  
The efficacy of intellectual property rights for economic 
development has also been taken as a given—albeit less sanctified than 
with private property—but recent literature has also threatened this 
notion.155 In the realm of intellectual property protection, increased 
intellectual property right enforcement has been linked to increased 
international trade flows,156 increased rates of foreign direct

investment,157 and greater levels of tech transfer.158 But a more recent 
study shockingly found that stricter intellectual property rights had not 
helped developing countries, and loose and limited intellectual property 
rights were actually more conducive to both knowledge accumulation 
and technological growth.159 This same study made the critical point 
that the best intellectual property system for the United States is not 
necessarily the best one for a developing country like India.160  
Indeed, developing countries are encouraged to “outsmart the  
high-protectionists by fashioning intellectual property regimes that 
match their own needs and capacities without violating international 
IP norms.”161 Similarly, it is important to consider cumulative 
innovation: how innovation can build off prior creations to create even 
greater benefits, knowledge, or entertainment for society.162 
Transitional structures that relax property rights are also 
necessary in many developing countries to create a more robust legal 
enforcement structure later in time. Often, unorthodox transitional 
structures are created in the short term to move from a com
