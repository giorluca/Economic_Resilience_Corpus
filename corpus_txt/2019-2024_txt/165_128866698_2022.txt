By Alim BELEK1a Djimoudjiel DJEKONBE b†  & Anatole Toinar MOGOTA c  Abstract. This paper analyzes the effects of procyclical regulatory capital adjustments on the ability of CEMAC economies to recover from the COVID-19. To achieve the objective, it uses quarterly data from 2005 to 2020 and Generalized Least Squares estimators as a technique. The results obtained show that the severity of the COVID-19 significantly impacted the economies of the sub-region and their ability to be resilient. Further, the results are robust regardless of the economic resilience indicator considered.  Pro-cyclical capital adjustments in the pandemic context have a positive impact on resilience, thereby reducing exposure to economic vulnerabilities. It is advisable to promote countercyclical adjustments of regulatory capital to improve economic resilience. This is regardless the fact that under COVID-19, economic contractions may induce banks to adopt more pro-cyclical behavior in order to reduce the vulnerability of economies. Keywords.

Introduction  he disruptions orchestrated by the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 plunged several economies into phases of unprecedented recessions. Declared in China, the leading economic partner of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries in terms of investment and trade, the pandemic has had a multidimensional global impact across economies worldwide. Appreciated as one of the least developed sub-regions in SSA, Economic Community of Central African States experienced a sharp contraction of its economy in the face of the pandemic. While the CEMAC economies recorded a positive variation in their average growth of 0.2% between 2018 and 2019 (largely supported by the favorable economic situations in Congo and Gabon with respective growth increases of 2.65% and 3.10% between), the forecast estimates during the pandemic are for an economic contraction of 1.6% by the end of 2020.

(BEAC, 2020). In order to build resilient economic capacity in the face of public debt, the IMF, in conjunction with the States, adopted internal resource mobilization programs that reduced the debt stock from 50.9% to 49% of GDP between 2019 and 2020. The contraction of economic activities caused by the pandemic has led to the deterioration of the depth of the financial system2 (on average equal to 2) and net equity  (down  18%  between  mid-June  2019  and  the  end  of  2020)  of  the  banks,  which  were already weak in 2018. Theoretically, the erosion of capital can depend on the contraction of economic activity or even the resurgence of default risks during a recession (Hollander, 2015).   The crises of the 1980s led the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to concede to banks the possibility of pro-cyclically adjusting their capital according to risks.  In other words, it is a question of covering the risks of loans to customers (up to 8%) by the equity capital or regulatory capital. In reading the Basel I to III standards, the transitional empirical results that led to the various reforms, showed that phases of economic contraction (recession) are materialized by a strong procyclicality of banks' capital or regulatory capital (Pessarossi & Weill, 2015). Indeed, in periods of economic recession correlated with an upsurge in default risks, banks ration the supply of credit to supposedly riskier economic agents (Claessens et al., 2009; Ouédraogo, 2014). In another sense, an inability of banks to be more resilient. However, banks are content to countercyclically release regulatory capital to meet credit demands from a profitability perspective in the expansion phase. In this way, the profitability perspective is in some ways reconciled with economic recovery or resilience in a global sense. In the same logic of guaranteeing long-term economic resilience, the contribution of the Basel standards consisted in promoting healthy banking competition, in short a financial and economic system less vulnerable to shocks. Apart from the etymological work of Holling (1973) on the notion of resilience oriented in the environmental   domain, the   current   debate   on   resilience   revolves around economic vulnerability, the index of resilience. Vulnerability is understood as adjustments in household incomes or economies to become less volatile in the face of exogenous shocks. Although Atkins et. al., (2000) find that vulnerability does not allow for the conclusion of any resilience capacity of an entity. Indeed, vulnerability results from exposure to shocks that do not depend on the economy, whereas resilience is explained in terms of the capacity to withstand a shock. The work of Ngouhouo & Nchofoung (2021), inspired by the empirical reviews of Atkins et al., (1998), has integrated into the consideration of economic resilience variants such as  2 Depth of credit information index (0=low to 8=high). Depth of credit information index measures rules affecting the scope, accessibility, and quality of credit information available through public or private credit registries. The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values indicating the availability of more credit information, from either a public registry or a private bureau, to facilitate lending decisions.

In a context where economies have struggled to ensure their resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, the current question remains not only empirical in relation to target indicators but also to target economic and especially prudential policy instruments.  While recent work by Angeon & Bates (2015) and Ngouhouo & Nchofoung (2021) introduces financial variants in the measurement of economic resilience, the prudential constraints of pro-cyclical adjustments to capital and provisions per se cannot be unaffected (Athanasoglou et al., 2014; Huizinga & Laeven, 2019). In light of this, this article asks whether the procyclical adjustment standard for regulatory capital can still remain appropriate in terms of boosting economies during the pandemic period. In contrast to previous studies on economic resilience, this article makes two angular contributions.  Complementing the work of Feindouno & Goujon (2016) and Ngouhouo & Nchofoung (2021), this paper integrates the prudential framework of regulatory capital adjustment into the composite index of economic resilience. On the other hand, it allows us to discuss the implications of banks’ behaviors in promoting economic stability in a pandemic context explicated by COVID-19.   2. Eclectic review of literature  When the Basel accords were adopted in the 1980s, the issue of risk coverage by minimum capital requirements made it possible to reconcile the debate between the traditional models in industrial economics. Indeed, the controversy between the Structure Behaviour Performance (SBP) and Efficiency Structure (ES) models revolved around the behavior of banks in financing economies under a given market structure.  The proponents of the Structure-Behaviour-Performance model developed by Bain in 1953, start from the central hypothesis that the structure of the banking market dictates banking behavior, affecting to a certain extent the quality of banking services offered (loans and deposits) (VanHoose, 2017). Further, this hypothesis assumes a non-negligible effect of prudential regulation of regulatory capital to constrain the supply of credit and the welfare of consumers or customers. In the same dimension of the public choice theory, prudential regulation makes it possible to guarantee public welfare via the resilience of the banking system as a whole. Indeed, the capacity to absorb shocks constitutes a guarantee for the regulator and a signal of financial stability perceived by investors and shareholders. The empirical analysis justifying this hypothesis apprehends the structure of markets as banking concentration (Stern & Feldman, 2004; Ouedraogo, 2012) as a source of resilience seen by consumers and the regulator. The contribution of the ES model developed by Demsetz in 1973 showed that the structure of the banking market when it is concentrated can lead to a reduction in deposit rates and increase the level of bank profits for the sole case of those that are cost efficient. In other words, low bank Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T. Mogota, JEL, 9(3), 2022, p.159-177. 162 162 concentration does not support a direct  improvement  in  consumer  welfare  via  a  situation  of  pure  and  perfect competition (Peltzman, 1977) . If the regulator's contribution is to promote low concentration so as to impact lending  and  borrowing  rates,  the  sole  consideration  of  the  intrinsic  cost management of banks may bias the regulator's objective. Bank cost adjustments in a situation of bank regulation based on recapitalization constraint can significantly affect the ability of some banks to being resilient and finance savings. Economic resilience in the sense of Kim's work (2014) is based on an analysis of the capacity of financial institutions  in  general  (via  fiscal  policy  instruments,  regulatory reserves, the key interest rate) to guarantee the stability of the economic system following a shock to the markets. At the level of microeconomic entities (such as banks), this resilience is similar to the constraints of adequate cyclical capitalization and the constitution of provisions for bad debt risks by banks (Saurina, 2011). Thus, on the one hand, we find the group of authors such as Mojon (1996), Couppey & Madiès (1997), Berenger & Teiletche (2003), Ayuso et al., (2004) concluding that the most procyclical variant in the behavior of banks in the face of the financing of economies is regulatory capital or risk coverage capital.  On the other hand, authors such as Huizinga & Laeven (2019) conclude given the current financial crises, the more procyclical nature of provisions to cover losses and bad debts. Whether it is provisions or capital, the macroeconomic framework of prudential regulation offers a guarantee of a resilient economic and financial system in times of crisis with pro-cyclical adjustment of banks' behavior. Indeed, banks may find themselves in a bind in meeting credit demands when they do not have the capital or capital adequacy to cover the risks. For the BCBS, the possibility of allowing banks to solidify their required capital with a surplus called the Tier 2 capital buffer can help to alleviate the financing constraints of economies. The issue of procyclicality received considerable  attention  in  the  G20  statements  following  the  Lehman  Brothers bankruptcy. The 2010 Basel Committee agreement (BCBS, 2010), known as Basel III, refers to the following four key objectives: to mitigate any cyclical overshooting of the minimum capital requirement, to promote more forward-looking provisions, to conserve capital to provide buffers  that  can  be  in  a  crisis,  and  to  achieve  the  broader  macro  prudential  objective  of protecting the banking sector from periods of excessive credit growth. The third objective gave rise  to  the  capital  conservation  buffer,  and  the  fourth  to  the  countercyclical  capital  buffer. Although the capital conservation buffer is a reasonable proposal in the remedial provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1992 (FDCIA), Repullo & Saurina (2012) argue that the proposed capital conservation buffer could actually exacerbate the procyclical phenomenon. Regarding capital buffers,  Marcucci  & Quagliariello  (2008) report  that  Italian  banks  reduced  their  loan  supply  during  the  period  1990-2004,  due  to  the decline in their capital buffers, which had a negative impact on GDP, while the findings for UK banks are Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T. Mogota, JEL, 9(3), 2022, p.159-177. 163 163 similar (Francis & Osborne, 2009). Discussions about the pro-cyclical effects of bank capital requirements also figured prominently on the regulatory reform agenda after the financial crisis that began in 2007. The argument that these effects can occur is well known. It is widely recognized that bank lending is cyclical, that is, banks respond to changes in economic activity. Specifically, during downturns, banks limit the supply of credit (Reza, 2011). At the same time, during these phases, the demand for new loans is low, because there are few alternative investment proposals with positive net present values.  In other words, there is a simultaneous decline in the supply and demand for credit. In a severe crisis such as the one in 2007, the decline in loan supply, at least initially, is greater than the decline in credit demand. The perspectives proposed (Basel III) around 2010 after this subprime crisis have given rise to a  new  consideration  of  the  concept  of  capital  procyclicality:  the  capital  buffer  or  capital cushion. Indeed, the capital buffer expresses the additional capital that is supposed to raise the level of capital in a countercyclical manner during a recession. Hollander (2015) concludes for the case of American banks that countercyclical capital adjustments make it possible to stabilize real shocks and limit financial instabilities.  3. Banking adjustments and economic dynamics in CEMAC: Stylized facts  While CEMAC countries were struggling to reconcile their growth trends with the financial depths of access to credit, the pandemic situation of COVID-19 has rather stalled the economic contraction due to restriction related to the confinement. Indeed, the drop in oil prices below $45 led to a decline in growth of 3% on average between 2015 and 2016. The recovery plans via the aid of the ADC (Development Assistance Committee)  and  IMF  countries  (an  average  of  $236  million  on  average),  which  were more evident in Cameroon, Congo and Equatorial Guinea 3 , helped to boost growth between 2017 and 2018. Thus, during this period, the average growth rate in CEMAC varied from 2.53% to reach a rate of -0.25% in 2018 against -2.29% in 2016. The contribution of banks in the process of economic recovery materialized by the adjustment  of  equity  capital  relative  to  the  level  of customer risks has experienced a real decline in late 2019. Under the auspices of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial depth however below average (0 low and 8 high level) was maintained stable (score of 2.6) between 2019 and 2020 despite the drastic decline in equity capital in the CEMAC. Indeed, in conjunction with the decline in growth sustained by Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, which were more affected by the pandemic, equity fell by CFAF 1,181 million to CFAF 1,105 million in 2020 compared to CFAF 2,286 million in 2019.   The closure of trade barriers was one  of  the  measures  taken  to  reduce  the  spread  of  the pandemic,  thereby  reducing  economic  activities  that   3 Based on authors' calculations from WDI (2020) and IMF report.

Due to their high dependence on international trade and the shocks suffered by their main partners, notably China and the European Union, CEMAC countries have also experienced a slowdown in their trade activities, especially in exports. The share of trade (exports + imports) in CEMAC has remained negatively stable despite the 0.5 point decline in the growth rate in 2019 against 2.4% in 2020 (UNDP, 2020). Equatorial Guinea and  the  Central  African  Republic  are  the  two  countries whose trade share fell by at least 2%.  4. Methodology  Despite the non-existence of a measure of resilience, it is conventionally granted under the assumption that the most resilient economies are the least vulnerable to economic shocks. Indeed, this validation came after Briguglio (2000) questioned the fact that, under certain constraints, small and supposedly fragile economies would be more resilient than large or developed economies. In reality, the resilience of small, but fragile, economies depend on the degree of control of external constraints on their examinations. Given this fact, studies such as Atkins et al., (2000) have found it useful to distinguish resilience indicators from vulnerability indicators.   4.1. Resilience indices and resilience-vulnerability gaps for CEMAC countries  4.1.1. Selection of composite indicators of economic resilience/vulnerability  The economic literature does not actually discriminate in the choice of component indicators to calculate resilience/vulnerability indices. However, the basis for the choice of indicators is explained by the dimensions of my economic vulnerability. Indeed, Briguglio (2000) and Ngouhouo & Nchofoung (2021), retained five (5) and three (3) integral components of economic resilience respectively. These include economic, social, environmental, governance and peripheral components (Angeon & Bates, 2015)4. For the purposes of this study, we will retain four (4) components to move from the vulnerability index to the economic resilience index.   Economic components  Unlike Atkins et al. (2000) who consider GDP volatility as a variant of economic resilience, most of the literature has confirmed the non-exhaustiveness of resilience components. In relation to the work of Angeon & Bates (2015), we will consider several categories of variables integral to the calculation of the economic component including public debt to GDP (Briguglio, 2016), the GDP deflator (inflation), the unemployment rate, oil rents to GDP, value added in the industrial, agricultural, manufacturing and service sectors as a percentage of GDP, and the degree of trade openness (Briguglio, 2000).   Institutional or political stability components   4 Voice and accountability, rule of law, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, and control of corruption.   Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T. Mogota, JEL, 9(3), 2022, p.159-177. 165 165 Alesina et al., (1989) combine political stability with institutional stability explained by unity in government and legislative support, using data from the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) established by the PRS group. In the current context, the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index is taken into account, whose values express the management of crime and impunity in a country as an institutional component. The index score varies between 1 and 6, expressing respectively a high and low level of the country's management quality on the socio-economic level.   Social components  The literacy rate, education and health expenditure per capita, life expectancy and the Gini index constitute the group of social components of economic resilience. The choice of variables in this group is based on the availability of data on the one hand. On the other hand, they are chosen in order to remove ambiguity with respect to their conceptions in empirical interpretations (Angeon & Bates, 2015).   Peripheral components  For the vast majority of works, we consider the existence of forces or variants supposedly exogenous such as transport costs, infrastructures, technology and the environment likely to have a significant impact on the resilient capacity of an economy. Thus, for the case of the peripheral components, we consider variables such as the number of internet users as a percentage of the population, CO2 emissions and renewable energy.  4.1.2. Economic resilience indices in terms of relative indicators  Based on the algorithm of Angeon & Bates (2015), Ngouhouo & Nchofoung (2021) constructed the economic resilience indices through the aggregated arithmetic means of the j components of resilience. On the other hand, the determination of the vulnerability index incorporates other types of components and indicators. The work of Angeon & Bates (2015) distinguished the categories of the integral components of resilience and vulnerability (see appendix for the selected indicators). The respective sub-indices of resilience (1) and vulnerability (2) are respectively given by the following relationships:  , ,1,1( )nrij t ijk trjijk tIr xx          (1)      and , ,1,1( )nvij t ijk tvjijk tVul xx          (2)  These indices are obtained upstream by the arithmetic mean of the observations of the k indicators belonging to the j components normalized by the differences between the maximums and the minimums at period t. Thus, the normalization is done by the formula:  Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T.

From the above, the four (4) groups of components below will allow the determination of the vulnerability and economic resilience indices.

Resilience-vulnerability gaps  Apart from the consideration of GDP volatility by Atkins et al. (2000) as an indicator of economic vulnerability, the Commonwealth Vulnerability Index has established since 1992, its own indicators via some key variables. The work of Angeon & Bates (2015) helped explain the contribution of determination in the heterogeneity of exposure to exogenous shocks. Indeed, the latter have shown the conditions under which an economy can be resilient but vulnerable and vice versa. The equation highlighted is the following:  , , ,i t i t i tEcart Ir Vul      (6)  4.3. Procyclical Regulatory Capital Adjustment Index  Hollander's (2015) approach considers from the work of Angelini et al. (2012), the taking of a macroprudential measure namely the leverage ratio given by the ratio of bank loans to capital5. The ratio allows banks to trade off cyclical readjustment of their capital to the economic situation (demand for loanable funds) and to be resilient following a given shock. Under Basel III, the procyclicality of capital is addressed by a countercyclical approach through the leverage ratio defined as follows: (1 )(1 ),1kttt tYeY                (7) With , t the targeted shock to the leverage ratio. Thus the conditions for bank capital procyclicality in the Hollander sense meet the following conditions:   5 tttLCAP  Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T.

The sensitivity of the change in capital can have a significant effect on other aggregates or indicators and even on the business cycle (Saurina, 2011). This, in a way, influences economic growth (Duval & Vogel, 2008). In the dynamics of bank behaviour, the Basel accords conceive of the pro-cyclical adjustment of regulatory capital (or equity) as the proportion raised under the constraint of an increase in possible credit losses or risks. Several empirical works (Rabell et al., 2005; Reza, 2011; De-Gregorio, 2012; Athanasoglou et al., 2014) have shown the existence of high cyclicality of regulatory capital in economic expansion or recession phases. In a context of delayed transition from Basel I to III, an adjustment of regulatory capital coverage defined as follows emerges:  _9 ( )risk wcapieightal equitycapted asrsets        (9)  4.4. Econometric model and estimation technique  It remains undeniable that variances in monetary (Rajan & Parulkar, 2008) and prudential or regulatory policy instruments of banks (Athanasoglou et al., 2014; Huizinga & Laeven, 2019) influence the real sector of the economy (Wibowo, 2008). In light of this, this article asks whether the procyclical adjustment standard for regulatory capital  can  still  remain  appropriate  in  terms  of  boosting  economies  during  the pandemic period. Given the existing dichotomy between resilience and economic vulnerability, it is important to analyse the effects on the intrinsic vulnerabilities of these economies. We will also take into account the gap approach in order to ensure the robustness of the effects of the dichotomy in the sense of Briguglio (2000). The general model can be specified as follows:  (10)it it it itY X Z           (10)  With Yit the group of economic resilience, vulnerability, and resilience-vulnerability gaps variable of country i at date t. The Xit variable of pro-cyclical adjustments of regulatory capital of banks in country i at date t. Zit is the group of control variables that can influence economic resilience. Theit is the error terms. Unlike the work of Atkins et al. (2000), which considered GDP volatility as an economic resilience variable, their study focused on a range of indicators that capture economic resilience through its vulnerability. Thus, the models to be estimated can be specified as follows:  Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T.

FDI and Microfin define respectively the proportion of foreign direct investment and the proportion of credit granted by microfinances in the GDP of each country in country i at the period t considered. ROA and ROE are respectively the levels of profitability of the assets and equity of the banks of the countries. In order to homogenize the data from the different databases, the variables were taken in logarithm.      The above theoretical conclusions have ruled out the non-exhaustiveness of the components of the economic resilience indicator. The range of elements used for this purpose suggests the possibility of the existence of endogeneity linked to the missing variables that can influence the resilience index and the vulnerability index. In addition, the dynamic process of economic resilience is likely to create unobservable heterogeneities. Thus, in order to estimate the above model, Generalized Least Squares (GLS) estimators will be used. This estimator will correct for autocorrelations of the residuals, which is a possible way of resolving the discussed endogeneity issues.  4.4. Data sources and descriptive statistics      This article uses a combination of several databases. Indeed, data on variables such as public debt, foreign direct investment, GDP, inflation, unemployment rate, and value added in the agricultural, industrial, manufacturing and service sectors, exports and imports, use of NICTs, CO2 emissions, consumption of renewable energies, education and health expenditure, life expectancy and the Gini index are taken from the WDI. In addition, the CPIA database was used to obtain data on the quality of governance of institutions. On the other hand, oil rents, equity, outstanding credits and credits to the economy are derived from the BEAC database. For COVID-19, Government Stringency Index (GSI) data measuring the monthly severity rate of the pandemic was used. Given the real time effects of the pandemic, the data used was quarterly from 2005 to 2020.   4.5. Descriptive statistics  The following table presents the descriptive statistics of the variables used in this study. On average the capital adequacy ratio is 2.67 points closer to the maximum value expressing the risk aversion of CEMAC banks. During the quarters in which the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic was observed, the average severity rate of the pandemic was 4 with a maximum of 4.5. The share of credit granted by microfinance institutions in GDP remains very low Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T.

This situation prevails for the other variables such as FDI and the resilience index whose averages are respectively around 3.11 and 0.99. The return on assets and equity have average estimated values of 0.65 and 2.82 points consecutively.  Table 1. Descriptive statistics Variable Obs Mean Std. Dev.

Results and interpretations  5.1. Main results  The Tables (2, 3 and 4) show the effects of the pro-cyclical capital adjustments and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economic resilience index. Given the weak direct linkages of the pandemic on the composite resilience indicator, the effects of the pandemic on transmission channels such as bank annuities (1), equity adjustments (2) and the share of microfinance credits in GDP were tested.  Figure 1 shows the correlation between capital adjustments in a context of rising bank risks and the economic resilience index. There is a negative correlation between the two variables. Procyclical increases in regulatory capital lead to a deterioration of the resilience index in CEMAC countries. However, it appears that the most resilient economies (Cameroon, Chad, Congo and Gabon) have countercyclical adjustments of their regulatory capital.    Figure 1.

The econometric results in the table below show that the pro-cyclical adjustments of equity capital constitute a loss of earnings for the economies. Indeed, despite the small (coefficient estimated at 0.009 points) effect of the increase in regulatory capital on the economic resilience index, the results remain significant at the 5% and 10% threshold. This state of affairs is explained by the excess liquidity of the CEMAC banking system, which in turn responds to the risk-averse behaviour of banks in the sub-region. The sign associated with the COVID-19 severity rate coefficient is  not seem insignificant.   Table 2.

The CEMAC countries constitute the group of countries with low mortality rates due to COVID-19, which explains the low coefficient obtained. The 1 point increase in the pandemic severity rate contributed to reducing the resilience of CEMAC economies by at least 0.002 points on average. Regardless of the transmission channel considered, the effects remain significant at the 5% threshold at least. The economic contraction under the pandemic also affected the contribution of microfinance institutions to GDP. Indeed, the advent of the pandemic significantly altered the sources of funding for economies (IMF and World Bank Group loans and WHO grants). By extrapolating the conclusion of the UNDP report (2020) on the effects of the pandemic in Cameroon, the CEMAC economies were strongly exposed by the decline in export earnings. For the same report, the containment strategy imposed by the different countries has affected the added values of the industrial (brewery) and Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T. Mogota, JEL, 9(3), 2022, p.159-177. 171 171 livestock sectors. According to the African Union report (2020), COVID-19 has affected the Moroccan and Egyptian economies through the revenues of the industrial sector and the transfer of migrants representing on average 6% to 4.4% of GDP.  Periods of economic recession are marked by strong pro-cyclical adjustments to capital given the assumed level of client risk. The effects of these adjustments on the financing of economies may also depend on the level of severity of the pandemic. The results table below shows that a high severity of COVID-19 leads to a positive effect on the resilience indicator via bank returns (0.0002 points) and pro-cyclical capital adjustments (0.034 points). Indeed, periods of economic contraction have stagnated bank profitability as a corollary to the excess liquidity of banks already observed in the sub-region. According to the IMF (2020), in order to limit the relative damage, it is important to ease monetary policy, provide adequate liquidity and meet the credit needs of SMEs. Figure 2 below shows the relationship between the resilience/ vulnerability gap index and regulatory capital. Two cases explain the links between the resilience/vulnerability gap index and adjustments to capital or regulatory capital. High vulnerability or significant resilience supports the direction of the links between these variables. Despite this correlation, Table 3 shows the results of the more robust estimated empirical effects.   Figure 2. Resilience/vulnerability index gap and regulatory capital (see separated file)  In contrast to the previous result that pro-cyclical adjustments of regulatory capital (in the presence of non-negligible risks) negatively affect the resilience of economies, the case below shows opposite effects on the Gap index. This effect is significant at the 1% level regardless of the control of the effects under COVID-19. In addition to this variable, the results of the effects of pro-cyclical adjustments, bank yields and the share of microfinance credits Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T. Mogota, JEL, 9(3), 2022, p.159-177. 172 172 in the presence of an increasing variation in the severity of COVID-19 also show signs contrary to the previous case.  Overall, these opposite effects (and especially the negativity of the signs of the coefficients) are attributable to the strong economic vulnerability explained by their dependence on oil revenues and external demand of CEMAC countries. These countries are known to be vulnerable on average to external economic fluctuations and because of their institutional management (Ngouhouo & Nchofoung, 2021). Despite the aspect of economic vulnerability, the imposed containment has led to a stalemate in the situation (UNDP, 2020). Thus, a pro-cyclical increase in regulatory capital of 1 point positively affects the gap between the resilience and vulnerability of these economies by 0.24 points on average. In light of this result, and contrary to the conclusions of Ngouhouo & Nchofoung (2021), a pro-cyclical adjustment of regulatory capital can ensure a less vulnerable economy despite the constraints they mention.

Robustness of results  In order to test the robustness or sensitivity of the results of the effects of regulatory capital adjustments in the context of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we used GDP as a measure of the resilience of economies in the sense of Atkins et al. The figure below confirms a priori the negative relationship between a procyclical variance of regulatory capital and GDP. The arbitrage of banks to ration credit constitutes a bottleneck to the financing of CEMAC economies.  Journal of Economics Library  A. Belek, D. Djekonbe, & A.T.

These include the effects of bank regulatory capital, the effects of COVID-19 and its interaction with profitability and procyclical adjustments. Table 4 shows that despite the variable explaining economic resilience, pro-cyclical capital adjustments negatively affect the economy. The strong growth in bad debts, which explains the increase in equity capital to cover relative risks, is a loss of earnings for the financing of CEMAC economies. Worse, in a context of economic contraction manifested by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects remain significant and more negative.  Table 4.

Robust and significant results at the 1% threshold regardless of the control for the effects of interactions between COVID-19 and ROE and the procyclicality of regulatory capital. The effects of ROE and regulatory capital adjustment on GDP in the presence of COVID-19 severity are estimated at 0.0015 and 0.18 points respectively. Results robust to the 1% threshold and explained by the idleness of bank deposits due to the slowdown in financial activities or transactions and the structural excess liquidity of CEMAC banks (Mvondo, 2020). The difference in the magnitude of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on GDP and the economic resilience index when reading the coefficients obtained can be explained by the different variables involved in determining the index.  6. Conclusion          In the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the common language among economies revolves around their resiliencies and more specifically the identification of an adequate indicator based on relative criteria. In addition, there is no consensus on the integral variables in the determination of the resilience index since the work of the commonwealth. This paper analyses the effects of pro-cyclical adjustments of banks' regulatory capital in a pandemic context of COVID-19 on the resilience of CEMAC economies. The results are obtained on quarterly data from several sources. As a corollary to expectations, the results obtained indicated that the effect of the severity of the pandemic did indeed negatively affect the composite indicator of economic resilience. Given the vulnerability of the sub-region's economies and the risk posed to bank customers, the pro-cyclical increases ensure that the economy is just less vulnerable.  These effects are robust when GDP is considered as the economic resilience variable. The results similarly showed that under the COVID-19 pandemic, bank profitability and equity instead increased as a result of lower credit demand due to the economic downturn.
