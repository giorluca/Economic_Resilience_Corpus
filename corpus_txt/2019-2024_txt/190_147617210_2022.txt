Published by Elseviea b s t r a c tOxy-fuel combustion is considered an attractive alternative to reduce pollutant emissions, which useshigh-purity oxygen mixed instead of air for combustion processes. However, purchasing large amounts ofhigh-purity oxygen may be unprofitable for certain industrial sectors, discouraging its implementation.Considering this, the potential of an oxygen production cycle for factories using oxy-fuel combustion isstudied by performing a thermo-economic analysis where high-purity oxygen, electricity, and naturalgas prices are considered. Oxygen is produced by membrane means, where mixed ionic-electronicconducting membranes are used, which require high temperatures and pressure gradients to workproperly. A set of turbochargers is implemented, chosen by scaling an off-the-shelf model, what in-troduces an innovative way of waste energy recovering for improving the performance of the cycle. Thewhole cycle is powered by waste heat from high temperature flue gases, and it is sized for a ceramicmanufacturing factory. In this work, two cases are analysed, differentiated by considering additionalheating and the vacuum generation method in the oxygen line. The first case exhibits smaller productionlevels, although better profitability (31Vt1), whereas the second case displays higher production levelsand production costs (33Vt1). Both cases are competitive concerning the average price of high-purityoxygen, supposing an average of 50Vt1 in wholesale markets, proving the potential of the proposedalternative for oxygen production.© 2022 The Authors.

IntroductionAccording to a report by the International Energy Agency [1],industrial processes accounted for 37% of the total global final en-ergy use in 2018, with direct emissions of 8.5 Gt of CO2 and 21.76Mtof NOx in 2015, representing 20% of the worldwide human-madeemissions [2]. This energy is often required in high-temperatureflows due to the demand of some industries in their processes: ashigh as 1450 C in cement kilns or even 2000 C in some ceramicfactories. These high temperatures are commonly reached byburning fossil fuels, leading to significant CO2 and NOx emissions. Inthis context, oxy-fuel combustion is an attractive alternative tothese plants to reduce polluting gases production, which consists ofusing high-purity oxygen instead of air during the required com-bustion process. The main benefits provided by this combustionuevas).r Ltd. This is an open access articltype are: Avoid NOx emissions due to the low content of N2 in the processgases. Less flue-gases compared with air-fired combustion because theremoval of nitrogen. This leads to a reduction of heat losses and,consequently, an increase in energy efficiency. Enables an easy separation of CO2 fromwater vapour in the fluegases, using the difference in condensation temperature. Thisleads to more carbon capture opportunities. Higher combustion temperatures, because of higher oxygenconcentrations, resulting in better efficiency of the process usingthe same fuel. High potential to be integrated with large industrial facilities aspower or cement plants, where higher combustion tempera-tures could improve the efficiency in this type of processes [3].Some applications and studies of oxy-combustion are found inthe literature in fields as diverse as internal combustion enginese under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419[4e7], power plants [8e10] and industrial processes [11e13]. In allthese studies, reducing emissions and CO2 capture are shown astheir main benefits.However, high-purity oxygen purchasing may be too expensiveto some industry sectors due to transportation and storage costs,and the increasing demand due to industrial growth. The latter hascaused, for example, an increase of 65% in the price in the UnitedStates in 20 years [14], and 24.4% due to economic changes asso-ciated to the COVID-19 pandemic. This market behaviour discour-ages oxy-fuel combustion applications in some industrial sectorsand has motivated the research and implementation of self-production of oxygen in different contexts.Nonetheless, themost extended and feasible method to produceoxygen, cryogenic air separation (CAS), does not exhibit a profitablebehaviour during operation in many applications, as shown in theworks of Escudero et al. [12], Cau et al. [15] or Xiong et al. [16],where energy penalties up to 6% are reported due to the integrationof the air separation system in systems such as power plants. Ac-cording to realistic economic trends analysed by Escudero et al.[12], CAS integration in industrial contexts is expected to be apossible alternative in the mid-term. Nevertheless, considerablefinancial risks are expected, as explained by Cau et al. [15]. In CAS,air components are separated according to their different boilingtemperatures. According to the review performed byWu et al. [17],several cryogenic plants are producing up to 150 t d1 of O2 (99.5%purity). However, CAS commercial units have low Second Law ef-ficiencies ranging between 15% and 24% [18], where the electricpower consumption is in the range of 160 kWh t1 to 270 kWh t1[19]. In these units, 85% of the energy is used in the air compressionand its distillation, being a highly-energy intensive process [20].Considering this, although there are some advantages gained byapplying oxy-fuel combustion, the thermo-economic penaltieswhen cryogenic air separation is implemented have encouragedthe study of alternative air separation systems, as the studies per-formed by Habib et al. [19]. In this context, most of the researchersrelated to oxy-fuel combustion are working in novel options for airseparation, where three different technologies could be high-lighted: pressure and temperature swing adsorption, chemicallooping air separation (CLAS), and membrane separation [17].Pressure swing adsorption consists of the separation of aircomponents where N2 is adsorbed in the surface of a material,generating an oxygen-enriched stream [21]. To separate gases, thematerial must have a preferential adsorption for N2, which dependson pressure: high pressure must increase the amount of N2 that isadhered to thematerial while low pressure decrease the adsorptionamount to regenerate thematerial, creating a pressure cycle [17,22].This technology is applied for small and medium productions,including the paper industry andmedical applications, according tothe NZ Institute of Chemistry [23]. The main difficulty to be solvedto increase the installation sizes is the limited adsorption capacitythat leads to a decrease in the O2 productionwhen higher flow ratesare required [17].On the other hand, the chemical looping air method consists oftwo interconnected reactors that use a carrier for oxygen trans-portation. In the first reactor, the oxygen carrier is exposed to at-mospheric air, where an oxidation process occurs, thus generatingan oxygen-depleted flow. Then, the carrier releases the oxygen inthe fuel reactor, where a typical combustion process is performed[17]. It is a promising technology where some thermodynamic as-sessments have found an energy requirement lower than 4e5times when compared with cryogenic methods [24,25]. However,this has been done only in laboratory-scale experiments and smallpilot plants, being a method that requires further research anddevelopment, especially about oxygen carriers applicable in anextended range of temperatures [17].2Additionally, there are polymeric and ion transport membranes(ITM). Polymeric membranes base their operation on the differentO2 and N2 diffusion rates through a membrane with a pressuregradient. Most membrane materials are more permeable to oxygenthan to nitrogen due to differences in molecule sizes. Nevertheless,the production of high-purity oxygen is difficult because some N2always permeates through the membrane, resulting in oxygen-enriched air around 40% of O2 rather than pure O2. Nonetheless,when higher oxygen purity is demanded, two stages of separationcould be applied, as shown in the reviews by Wu et al. [17] andSmith and Klosek [22].Finally, ITM are membranes where oxygen ions are transportedfrom the high-oxygen concentration or feed side to the low-oxygenconcentration or permeate side [17]. In this type of membranes, O2molecules are adsorbed on an electrically conducting coatinglocated over the surface of the membrane, where they are disso-ciated to form oxygen ions [17]. Generally, these membranes arecomposed of a type of dense ceramic compound with a particularcrystal lattice structure, often called mixed oxygen ionic and elec-tronic conducting (MIEC) materials [17,26]. In MIEC materials, ox-ygen ions can diffuse via the lattice vacancies or interstitial sitesunder the driving force of the oxygen chemical potential gradientacross the membranes. MIEC membranes offer a permeationselectivity for oxygen of 100%, with a lower energy consumptionthan cryogenic distillation technology and less capital investment[26,27]. Among all the different MIEC membranes,Ba0$5Sr0$5Co0$8Fe0$2O3d (BSCF) is one of the most popular mate-rials implemented in high purity oxygen production because of itshigh permeation, performing a stable operation while the oper-ating temperature is above 850 C, according to Wu et al. [17], Zhuand Yang [26] and Arratibel Plazaola et al. [27].MIEC membranes for air separation are a technology with highpotential for commercialisation in the following years. There arestudies of oxygen production by MIEC membrane means for ap-plications as power plants that exhibit better economic perfor-mance and an efficiency improvement of up to 5% compared withcryogenic methods [28e30]. One of the leading organisation increating membranes for air separation on a commercial scale, AirProducts & Chemicals, has been working with different companiesand institutes on this. They have been drawing up a multiphaseplan considering a technical feasibility phase (Phase I with pro-totypes that generate high purity oxygen in a 0.1 TPD rate) to acommercial scale where a 2000 TPD production could be achieved[26]. In one of the latest reports from Air Products, Anderson et al.[31] exhibited the construction and operation of a test unit with aproduction capacity of 100 TPD and smaller-scale experiments thatdemonstrate the continued oxygen production for 15000 h. Also,Praxair can be highlighted as another organisation whose contri-butions are generating advances in generating a commercial-scaleunit of air separation membranes [32]. They have reported pat-ents of MIEC membranes development, applied in chemical andelectric power applications [33,34]. With the above said, there areefforts to create the first commercial-scale units in the next fewyears that can compete in terms of energy consumption and pro-ductionwith CAS, where works in mechanical strength and densityof membrane area per volume are topics that need improvementsfor practical applications [35].Meanwhile, certain conditions must be reached to produceadequate O2 flows in MIEC membranes. Zhu et al. [36] studiedoxygen permeation through dense mixed-conducting perovskiteceramic membranes (BSCFO) under different conditions of tem-perature and feed pressure. It was found that elevated feed pres-sures increase oxygen permeation flux and temperatures as high as900 C are beneficial to oxygen recovery. Also, Li et al. [14] studieddifferent models of oxygen transport through MIEC using differentJ.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419materials and applications. Temperatures between 700 C and1000 C are needed and considerable pressure gradients betweenfeed and permeate sides are required. Given this, different sce-narios of oxygen production can be obtained as variables as pres-sure gradients and temperatures in O2 production cycles variedduring its operation.The interest in oxy-fuel combustion processes and oxygen pro-duction by means of MIEC membranes is demonstrated in all thesepublished works. Nonetheless, as far as the authors of this manu-script know, there is no previously published literature in whichoff-design conditions of an oxygen production cycle for oxy-fuelcombustion applications is studied. Additionally, the authors havenot found literature where controllable variables such as turbo-machine speeds or valve openings are modified to obtain differentoxygen production levels for industrial applications.Hence, the novelty of the present manuscript is the thermoe-conomic analysis of a proposed oxygen production cycle perform-ing in a wide range of operation. Also, to evaluate off-designconditions whose production is expected to be used in oxy-combustion processes within a ceramic-production facility. Thiscycle uses a MIEC membrane of BSFC material, whose waste heat ofthe flue gases is recovered to heat up and pressurise the MIEC feedair. In order to analyse off-design conditions, a parametric study isperformed, varying controllable variables of the cycle such as tur-bomachine speeds and valve openings. The assessment of eachoperating point is performed in terms of oxygen production, energyconsumption, and operational costs where current prices of high-purity oxygen, electricity, and natural gas are considered. Theperformance of the cycle is then compared with other oxygenproduction alternatives, and it is computed for a wide range ofoperating conditions.Additionally, to rise the air pressure at the membrane inlet, a setof turbochargers are implemented to exploit the available energyfrom the outlet membrane gases, obtained after separating N2 fromthe air. These turbochargers are chosen to rely on an off the shelfmodel commonly used in the automotive industry, which werescaled depending on the thermodynamic conditions (pressure andtemperature) in which they operate. Two different cases are ana-lysed, whose differences concern in the heat addition and drivingenergy of the vacuum pump in the oxygen line. On that basis, themain objectives of this study are mentioned as follows: Design and optimise two cases of a cycle of O2 production bymeans of MIEC membranes powered by waste heat of flue gasesof an industrial cycle and commercial off-the-shelf radial tur-bochargers, finding the critical elements from the point of viewof the performance of the cycles. Assess the behaviour of the cycle from a thermoeconomicalperspective in off-design conditions, using performance in-dicators such as O2 mass flow (kg s1), production cost per massof oxygen produced (Vt1) and amount of O2 per consumedenergy (kg kW1 h1). Assess the operative feasibility of the proposed cycles in termsof direct costs of operation, comparing against typical purchasecosts found in O2 wholesale markets (50Vt1).2. Process descriptionThe proposed oxygen production cycle cases are shown in Fig. 1and Fig. 2. The current configuration has been established after aniterative process considering an oxygen production of 0.12 kg s1,driving 0.65 kg s1 to 0.75 kg s1 of air at atmospheric conditionsand pursuing an inlet membrane pressure around 900 kPa. Thecycle starts driving atmospheric air flow (25 C, 100 kPa) through3three initial intercooled compression stages (C1, C2, C3) coupledwith expansion stages (T1, T2, T3), forming turbocharger systems.Also, an electric compressor is implemented to start the operationof the whole system. Then, the air flows into a set of heat ex-changers to obtain thermal energy and recover energy from otherparts of the cycle.One of these heat exchangers contributes energy to the air flowby using flue gases from a furnace used to manufacture ceramicproducts (HE4 in Case 1 and HE3 in Case 2). Typically, the furnaceproduces a mass flow of 0.27 kg s1 composed of CO2 and H2Osteam, products of combustion processes. The temperature of thisflow could be higher than 1000 C, for which it is exploited torecover its thermal energy and drive the cycle by increasing the airtemperature. In addition, a heater could be added to increase airtemperature, generating two different cases depending on thepresence of extra heat addition.The air enters to a three-end MIEC membrane where oxygen isseparated from the air. An oxygen-depleted flow (mainly N2) isproduced, where its remaining energy is recovered at two heatexchangers and in the set of turbines initially mentioned. On theother hand, the oxygen flow is cooled by going through two heatexchangers used to heat the air, and, finally, its temperature isreduced in a cooler before the vacuum pump to enhance its per-formance. This vacuum pump in the oxygen line could be drivenelectrically or by implementing a turbocharger, locating its turbinebetween high and medium pressure stages (T2 and T3), generatingtwo options to be analysed.Therefore, two different cases are studied, considering thepossible combinations of the mentioned alternatives of heat addi-tion or type of driving energy in the vacuum pump in the oxygenline:Case 1: No heat addition/electric compressor at O2 line. There islimited availability in thermal energy due to the absence of aheater to increase the temperature in the air flow and the highdependence on the conditions (mass flow and temperature) ofthe flue gases coming from the furnace. Therefore, vacuumgeneration in the oxygen line takes place using an electriccompressor, exploiting the available enthalpy in the oxygen-depleted flow solely to increase the pressure in the air flow.Consequently, this alternative possesses a higher efficiency inthe vacuum generation at the O2 line than in Case 2.Case 2: Heat addition/Turbocharging at O2. A heater is added atthe end of the heat exchangers stages. This heater increases theair temperature to 1000 C, which is a typical value for MIECmembranes, by burning part of the produced O2 with naturalgas. Thus, the oxygen-depleted flow has more available energy.For this reason, a turbocharger is implemented for vacuumgeneration in the oxygen line, whose expansion stage is locatedbetween the high and medium pressure turbines (T3 and T2) topower up the compressor.Therefore, there is control upon the inlet temperature at themembrane, improving its permeability. Nevertheless, there is adecrease in the vacuum generation efficiency due to the turbo-charger use and the mass flow disequilibrium between both tur-bomachines (C0 and T0). The latter might cause an increase in theelectric energy consumption of the high-pressure electriccompressor, which could overcome the reduction of electric energyconsumption caused by the removal of an electric compressor inthe oxygen line. The vacuum pressure in the oxygen line iscontrolled by using a wastegate that varies the mass flow across T0,regulating the available energy in the turbine and, thus, thecompressor power and the vacuum pressure in the last instance.Fig. 1.

Method descriptionThe cycle modelling was carried out using VEMOD [37], which isa computational tool developed at I$U$I CMT e Motores Termicosoriginally aimed at 0D/1D modelling of thermo-and fluid dynamicprocesses in engines, but it is flexible to simulate independent el-ements such as turbochargers, coolers, pipes, heat exchangers,membranes, simple electric systems and control units. Moreover,VEMOD performs transient simulations, which enable the calcu-lation start and stop conditions and determine resonant and un-stable operation points.Additionally, there is a set of assumptions and restrictions to beconsidered, to simplify the calculations and limit the performanceevaluation performed.3.1. ModellingVEMOD solves Euler's fluid dynamics equations in 1D insideducts using a finite-volume approach. The equations are solvedusing a MUSCL method, including heat transfer and friction effectsusing source terms obtained from correlations such as Colebrook-White's equation for Darcy's friction factor. Several elements aresolved in 0D, such as the heat exchangers and the MIECmembrane:4continuity and energy conservation equations are used, includingsource terms due to heat transfer or species permeation. In addi-tion, oxygen production in the MIEC membrane is also determinedas is described by Catalan-Martínez et al. [38], where simplifiedequations are given for 1D modelling.The turbochargers are solved as actuator disks connected toequivalent 1D ducts, introducing momentum and energy sourcesand sinks from characteristic curves map data. They take into ac-count also friction losses and heat transfer effects, as described inthe works by Serrano et al. [39e42]. The turbine and compressormaps are extrapolated and interpolated as described in the worksby Serrano et al. [43], Payri et al. [44], and Galindo et al. [45,46].Additionally, it is known that for transient and pulsating con-ditions, shaft inertia of the turbochargers has a notable influence inthe performance of both turbine and compressor as it is shown byPark et al. [47]. However, the influence of shaft inertia is notconsidered due the steady-state approach in this study.3.2. Assumptions and simplificationsThe following assumptions were taken into consideration tosimplify the study:J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419 Isothermal flow inside the MIEC membrane as it is assumed inmodels found in the literature, which are validated using CFD[38] and experimental data [48,49] with accurate results. Pressure losses in the air line of 10 kPa for each heat exchanger. Heat exchanger effectiveness remain constant: there are nodetailed specifications of heat exchangers in this preliminarydesign stage. Energy consumption of auxiliary components (cooler pumps,electrical and electronic devices) is not considered in this study. An additional cost of production of 18Vt1 for each calculatedpoint is considered estimating an installation cost of 570000 V.This cost is estimated after consulting several developers of thistype of facilities and includes all the elements, themanufacturing, installation and labor costs. It supposes anaverage O2 production of 100 g s1 during a facility lifetime of 10years, which is equivalent to the average O2 consumption of theceramic factory for which this facility has been sized. The heater in Case 2 is modelled considering a 85% efficiency,which considers heat losses and combustion efficiency. The air isheated with the gas products of burning part of the produced O2with natural gas (considered mainly CH4). These gases leave theheater with a temperature difference of 10 C with the tem-perature of the inlet air.3.3. Components design and selectionThe component design and selection uses reference conditionsof air and oxygen mass flows through the whole cycle. Initially, thecycle is supposed tomove 0.65 kg s1 of air with a vacuum pressureof 40 kPa for Case 1 and 0.70 kg s1 and a vacuum pressure of 35 kPafor Case 2.The turbochargers used in the cycle were chosen taking asreference a typical commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) componentfrom the automotive industry. Each turbomachine is scaleddepending on the inlet temperature and pressure and flowcapacity,pursuing a point of operation with high efficiency. The election ofCOTS turbocharger as a base lies in the high availability of this typeof components, facilitating the purchase of replacement parts incase of wearing and maintenance, besides its competitive price.The turbocharger taken as reference consists of a radialcompressor with a wheel diameter of 40 mm, a maximum cor-rected mass flow of 0.14 kg s1 and a maximum corrected speed of229 000 rpm. It is driven by a radial variable nozzle turbine whichhas awheel diameter of 37.5 mm, amaximum reducedmass flow of12.16 kg s1 K0.5 MPa1 and a maximum reduced speed of112.2 Hz K0.5, whereas the shaft has a diameter of 6 mm.The scaling process consists of keeping constant the non-dimensional mass flow and speed to maintain the similarity inthe turbomachines, allowing the correct scalability. These non-dimensional groups are calculated using Equation (1) and Equa-tion (2):m̂ ¼_mffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffig,R,T1;tpD2,p1;t,g(1)N̂ ¼ N,Dffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffig,R,T1;tp (2)where m̂ is the non-dimensional mass flow, _m is the mass flow, g isthe ratio of heat capacities, R is the gas constant, T1,t is the totaltemperature at the inlet of the turbomachine, D is the wheel5diameter, p1,t is the total pressure at the inlet of the turbomachine,N̂ is the non-dimensional rotational speed and N is the rotationalspeed.Additionally, adiabatic efficiencies in each operation point of ascaled turbomachine remain constant as the exact Mach, Reynoldsand dimensionless velocity triangles are assumed to be kept almostidentical to the originals. Therefore, the adiabatic maps of eachturbomachine are obtained to calculate real efficiencies consideringheat and friction losses, which depend on several geometric vari-ables of the turbomachine that are changed due to the appliedscale.Therefore, heat transfer and friction losses are calculated byconsidering the scale dimensions, where coefficients and areas ofheat transfer between turbomachine components and the turbo-machine itself with the environment are recalculated with thevalue of the scale. In contrast, linear values as diameters or lengthsare determined by using the square root of the mentioned scale.Concerning the efficiencies of the heat exchangers, specialattention is given to HE3 for Case 1 and HE4 for Case 2, because ofthe coupling between the temperature increase in the air flow andthe available energy in the expansion stages. In addition, theeffectiveness of the other heat exchangers are set at 80%, consid-ering the following restrictions: Avoid outlet temperatures at electric compressors higher than200 C, to prevent failures in the operation of these turbo-machines, as their wheels are generally made of aluminium. Limit the effectiveness of the heat exchangers below valueswhich could not be technically viable for the installation(greater than 90%). Maximise oxygen production.Compressor sizes are selected such that the operation points insteady conditions have the best efficiency and a surge margin aswide as possible. Similarly, turbine sizes purse the best possiblecoupling with their respective compressors and the stator nozzlepositions are selected using an optimisation process where theoxygen flow is maximised.Regarding the membrane area, a higher area is expected in Case1 to compensate for the lower amount of available energy at themembrane inlet. In this sense, a parametric study is performed,considering the produced oxygen and its associated costs, where aconstant air mass flow driven by the compressor is assumed foreach case, controlled by the high-pressure electric compressor(HPEC) speed.3.4. Performance evaluation and analysisA set of parameters were varied to generate operative maps asfollows: High-pressure electric compressor (HPEC) speed. O2 line electric compressor speed (OLEC) (in Case 1). Wastegate valve opening (in Case 2).Three indicators were considered for the analysis of the maps:gross production, produced mass per unit of energy consumed (E(kg/kWh)), and O2 production cost (C (V/t)). These indicators wereused to evaluate the different variants of the cycle that were pro-posed from three different perspectives: gross production, eco-nomic and energetic.The following prices in Table 1 for natural gas and electricity areused, considering several prices available in the current energyTable 2Turbocharging scaling.Case Turbocharger Compressor Turbine1 Low pressure 9 9Medium pressure 4 4High pressure 3 42 Low pressure 15 20Medium pressure 7 9High pressure 3 4O2 line 4 4J.R.

A safe distance fromsurge line in the compressors case is kept when turbochargers sizesare selected, while the oxygen production and cost are consideredfor membrane size and heat exchanger effectiveness.4.1. Turbocharger scalingThe following scaling values are selected concerning tocompressor and turbine reference sizes, as shown in Table 2 forboth cases:For these scaling values, peak efficiency values that range be-tween 60% and 70% for both types of turbomachines are obtained,and a cautious distance from the surge line in the case of thecompressors is kept. Performance and efficiency maps of the scaledcompressors are found in Appendix A.4.2. Critical heat exchanger4.2.1. Case 1An increase in the effectiveness of this heat exchanger producesTable 1Current average prices of natural gas and electricity in Spanish market.Average natural gas price (ANP) 0.026V/kWhAverage electricity price (AEP) 0.100V/kWhConversion factor for natural gas (CF) 13.89 kW h kg16an increase in the oxygen mass flow because there is a highertemperature at the inlet of the membrane as shown in Fig. 3a.However, this increase in HE3 effectiveness decreases the availableenergy in the expansion stages, requiring an increment in theelectric energy consumption by the HPEC.Considering this, a value of 55% in this efficiency is selected,where a minimum value in the cost per production of oxygen canbe found, as Fig. 3b shows, preserving an acceptable oxygen massflow. As conclusion, an improvement in the heat transfer of thisheat exchanger does not imply an enhancement in the global per-formance of the cycle.4.2.2. Case 2Net oxygen production increases almost linearly as the heattransfer in HE4 grows, as shown in Fig. 4a. This can be explainedconsidering a decrease in gross production as the efficiency is ris-ing. However, this also leads to a reduction in the heat that shouldbe added in the heater, whose combustion process is performedusing part of the produced oxygen, which finally conducts to a netoxygen production that increases with the efficiency of thisparticular heat exchanger.Likewise, regarding cost per produced oxygen, whose behaviouris depicted in Fig. 4b. Higher efficiency in HE4 causes an increase inelectrical energy consumption due to a reduction in the availableenergy in the expansion stages, increasing the electric compressorwork. Nonetheless, this is compensated with a decrease in naturalgas consumption in the heater, causing a reduction in the cost perproduced oxygen. In this case, an efficiency value of 70% is selected,considering technical issues with higher values of efficiency as size,cost, and maintenance expenses.4.3. Membrane areaA higher membrane area in the cycle allows an increase in ox-ygen production. Fig. 5a exhibits the oxygen production dependingon themembrane area for Case 1, where an asymptotic behaviour isshown. There is not a considerable increment in oxygen productionfrom 30 m2 onwards. This performance is due to the decreasedavailable energy in the expansion stages. The oxygen productiongrows, subtracting oxygen-depleted mass flow due to constant airmass flow, reducing the available energy through the turbines. Thisreduction in oxygen-depletedmass flow causes an increase in HPECconsumption. For this reason, a 30 m2 is selected for this case. Thelatter is an effect that could also be perceived in Fig. 5b, where thereFig. 3. Oxygen production as a function of HE3 efficiency in Case 1.Fig. 4. Oxygen production as a function of HE3 efficiency in Case 2.Fig. 5. Oxygen production as a function of the membrane area for Case 1.J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419is an asymptotic behaviour. This is due to the effects of reducing theavailable energy in the turbines, causing a higher electric con-sumption, which is compensated with an increment in oxygenmass flow.A similar performance is displayed in Case 2, as shown in Fig. 6aand Fig. 6b. It is seen that the same behaviour as Case 1 is7performed, requiring smaller areas to produce oxygen. There is lessavailable energy for the turbines due to a reduction in the oxygen-depleted mass flow increasing the electric energy consumption inHPEC and a higher requirement in the heat addition as a conse-quence of the same decrease in the oxygen-depleted mass flow,which reduces the heat transfer capacity in HE4.Fig. 6. Oxygen production as a function of the membrane area for Case 2.J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419In this case, a membrane area of 15 m2 is selected, considering ahigher availability of thermal energy in this case compared withCase 1, which is compensated with lower costs in facilities andmaintenance by reducing the membrane area.4.4. Variable geometry turbine nozzle positionsAn optimisation process was performed for both cases, using theoxygen mass flow produced as the objective function during thecalculation. The results are shown in Table 3. The efficiency of theturbomachines is kept high in all the cases but for the turbine thatdrives the O2 compressor.5. Performance evaluation and analysis5.1. Case 1A maximum value of oxygen mass flow of 0.124 kg s1 is foundat 75% of the maximum speed at HPEC and maximum speed atOLEC as it is depicted in Fig. 7a.Higher OLEC speeds increase the oxygen mass flow due to adecrease in the vacuum pressure in the oxygen pipeline, whichimproves the membrane permeability. On the other hand, for themaximum value of OLEC speed, an optimum value of producedoxygen is achieved at 75% of the maximum HPEC speed.As the HPEC speed increases, air mass flow and pressure in-crease, causing an improvement in the membrane performancebecause of a higher feed pressure. Nonetheless, there is a reductionin the membrane inlet temperature, as shown in Fig. 7b, due to ahigher heat capacity in the air mass flow, decreasing the oxygenproduction as a result of declining O2 permeation.In Fig. 7c, as well as in FIgure 7d, it is noted that higher oxygenTable 3Optimum turbine nozzle positions and efficiencies for both cases.Case Turbocharger Turbine Turbine Compressor Speedposition [%] efficiency [%] efficiency [%] [rpm]1 Low pressure 20 75 74 50000Medium pressure 20 77 72 91000High pressure 16 59 74 590002 Low pressure 20 66 72 30000Medium pressure 20 73 71 61000High pressure 15 67 74 88000O2 line 80 36 72 1020008productions lead to an increase in the oxygen cost compared withthe optimum cost point. The higher oxygen productions are ach-ieved at high speeds in both electric compressors, increasing thepressure gradient at the membrane. Nonetheless, there is areduction in the air temperature at the membrane inlet due to anincrease in air heat capacity, affecting production. For lower speedsin both electric compressors, the pressure gradient is affected.However, a considerable increase in the air temperature at themembrane inlet is obtained, as it is seen in Fig. 7b due to a dimi-nution in air heat capacity. Therefore, oxygen production at theoptimum cost point is performed with low electric energy con-sumption and a high temperature but with less production becauseless air mass flow is driven through the membrane.Likewise, it is shown that the cycle is cost-effective in themaximum production operation point, being 38% lower comparedwith the reference prices commonly available in the wholesalemarkets (50Vt1). Besides, these results show a certain level offlexibility during the operation of the cycle depending on the ox-ygen requirement in a particular moment, enhancing the produc-tion cost even if less oxygen is demanded. Therefore, the variationof the oxygen production as a function of the demand is pursued bydriving the speeds through the gradient line between themaximum production point and smaller cost per produced oxygen(lower oxygen production) to operate with a better unitary costunder intermediate demand values.5.2. Case 2As the heater assures the MIEC inlet temperature at the end ofthe heat recovery stages, Fig. 8a depicts a high dependence in theHPEC speed to cause an increment in oxygen production. In thiscase, it should be clarified that opening percentages for thewastegate (WG0 at Fig. 2) higher than 20% are considered to avoidcycle instabilities, especially under low compressor speeds.Higher HPEC speeds imply an increase in the MIEC pressureinlet, which improves the oxygen production. The maximum oxy-gen production is found at the maximum speed of the HPEC and a30% of wastegate opening, achieving 0.227 kg s1 of oxygen pro-duction. Nonetheless, there is also an increase in the air mass flow,leading to a decrease in the temperature after the heat recoverystages. For this reason, considering a lower temperature before theheater and a higher air mass flow, the required thermal energyrises.Given the above, Fig. 8b depicts the cost per produced oxygenduring the operation of Case 2. It is observed how the highest HPECFig. 7. O2 production as a function of the electric compressor speeds in Case 1.J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419speeds lead to an increase in electric and thermal energy con-sumption due to an increased air mass flow, as it was explained. It isshown that, compared with the 50Vt1 value taken as a marketreference, the use of this configuration is profitable running theHPEC under 71%e85% of the maximum speed, depending on thewastegate opening, which implies less thermal energy addition atthe heater.Considering the latter, Fig. 8a indicates acceptable values ofoxygen production under 60% of the maximum speed of HPEC,achieving 0.12 kg s1, which is initially proposed in the cycledescription.In this regard, lower HPEC speeds decrease both air mass flowand pressure at the membrane inlet, reducing oxygen production.However, the energy consumption, thermal and electric, isreduced: first, less thermal energy is required because a reduced airmass flow with a higher temperature reaches the heater inlet, andthe electric power is diminished due to the reduced speed. Thisimproves the energy consumption as it is seen in Fig. 8c.6. DiscussionThe different cycle components are selected for two cases wherea heat exchanger (HE3 in Case 1, HE4 in Case 2) is identified as acritical component during operation, as it is directly coupled with9the inlet flow at the expansion stages. This makes this heatexchanger to affect both electric and thermal consumption.For Case 1, it is important to remark the importance of HE4,where flue gases from the plant contribute to the air heating beforethe membrane, being this the primary source of thermal energy forthis scenario. Similarly two optimum operation points have beenidentified: maximum production and other of minimum produc-tion cost. Thus, it is recommended, for intermediate operationpoints (between 0.06 kg s1 to 0.1235 kg s1), to operate in con-ditions whose production cost is minimum, which are obtained byusing optimisation methods. Regarding profitability, the maximumproduction point exhibits a production cost of 30.8Vt1, which is38% smaller than the current average cost available in the whole-sale markets, being a feasible option to implement in the ceramicindustry.For Case 2, it should be mentioned as a critical component theturbocharger T0-C0, that restricts the available energy in the me-dium and low-pressure turbines, affecting the electric energyconsumption and the membrane inlet pressure. This also occursdue to mass flow disequilibrium between the turbine and thecompressor, causing a considerable energy loss in this component.Regarding the maximum oxygen mass flow produced, in thisparticular case the cycle can generate amounts as high as0.227 kg s1, being almost twice the proposed production in theFig. 8. O2 production as a function of the electric compressor speed and waste gate opening in Case 2.J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419initial description of this cycle. However, this production has a costof 65.4Vt1, which exceeds in 30% the current available price in thewholesale market. Consequently, the cost for the maximum oxygenflow is not profitable.Therefore, if a competitive cost with an acceptable production,Case 2 must operate in the region of Fig. 8b whose values in theproduction costs are less than 50Vt1, being the maximum pro-duction of 0.18 kg s1 under this restriction. This is accomplishedunder HPEC speeds that range between 70% and 85% of itsmaximum, being highly dependent on the WG valve opening. Acritical value is not exhibited regarding the production cost itself.However, taking as a reference a production of 0.12 kg s1, a costproduction between 33Vt1 to 38Vt1 is estimated, being this20%e30% smaller than the available price in the wholesale market.Given the above, comparing both cases of the presented cycle, itis demonstrated that Case 2 has a higher oxygen production, whichis a result of its high thermal energy consumption to guarantee atemperature of 1000 C at the entrance of the membrane. None-theless, this consumption limits the operative range for this case,where a considerable part of the studied operation points is notprofitable compared with the average oxygen cost in the market.The latter contrasts with Case 1, where oxygen production levels10are smaller but the profitability in the different operation pointsstudied limits the operation only for high speeds in HPEC andmedium to low speeds in OLEC. In these conditions, a considerableair mass flow is driven through the cycle with a high inlet pressurein themembrane but a high vacuum pressure and low temperature.This leads to smaller oxygen production rates with high energyconsumption.Thus, both cycles can be implemented depending on the specificrequirements and conditions of the user. When higher levels ofoxygen production are required, trading off in a certain way theproduction cost, Case 2 could be implemented. Furthermore, whenthere is a lower demand of oxygen and the price is a more criticalvariable, Case 1 is shown as an acceptable option to be considered.The discussion of the different prices in both cases can beextended by remarking that one of the reasons that leads to asmaller production cost in Case 1 is the better use of energy togenerate the vacuum. In Fig. 9a, it is depicted the global efficiency ofthe turbocharger associated with the oxygen line in Case 2. It isshown a low efficiency in all the studied operation points, with amaximum value of 30%. Meanwhile, Fig. 9b depicts the variation ofthe compressor efficiency at the oxygen line in Case 1. It is shownthat there is an average efficiency higher than 60%, with pointsFig. 9. Efficiency of turbocharger 0 in Case 2 and C0 in Case 1.J.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419reaching an efficiency of 70% near the point of maximum produc-tion. This misused energy at Case 2 must be compensated withelectric energy consumption at the HPEC to drive air mass flow andincrease its pressure.It should be mentioned also that, although the current calcula-tions can be numerically stable, they may lead to extremely smallsurge margins in the OLEC in Case 1, specially in HPEC low speeds.Special attention must be given to these operation points, wherescaling the current compressor or making a new selection areshown as the best alternatives to enhance the performed study.On the other hand, an energy consumption comparison shouldbe performed considering different oxygen production methodsand their specific oxygen production. Table 4 exhibits differentstudies that have been performed applying the three leadingtechnologies currently being developed for oxygen production.Purity values in the produced oxygen stream are comparablewith cryogenic methods, whose nature implies that other aircomponents are dissolved in the oxygen stream, generating im-purities in the production. On the other hand, compared with CLAS,Case 1 of the study seems to be price-competitive with the citedstudies, reaching a higher purity due the exclusive oxygenpermeation of the MIEC materials. However, higher productionlevels are reached in these studies, which could modify their spe-cific production if similar oxygen production is demanded, as is alsoseen in this study.7.

Thedesigns of two cases of the O2 production cycle are optimisedwhere HE3 for Case 1 and HE4 for Case 2 are recognised as criticalelements that affect both the electrical and thermal energy con-sumption, depending on the case. Additionally, HE4 for Case 1 andT0-C0 for Case 2 are identified as components that directly affectthe performance of the cycle in both cases.The behaviour of the cycle is assessed using indicators such ascost per mass of oxygen produced (Vt1) and amount of oxygen perconsumed energy (kg kW1 h1). For Case 1, an optimum oxygenmass flow is found (0.1235 kg s1), reaching an acceptable pro-duction according to the oxygen production goal used in the initialsteps of design. With a cost of 30.8/t, it is a competitive cycle whencompared with wholesale market prices and an alternative to beapplied in sectors where high purity oxygen is needed, such as theceramic industry.This optimum point of production is found in an equilibriumzone between high pressure and air mass flow at the membraneinlet and high temperature. Higher compressor speeds in HPECgenerate lower temperatures at the membrane inlet while lowerspeeds lead to a smaller pressure gradient and air mass flow,affecting oxygen production.The point of minimum cost is found in a zone of high temper-ature at the membrane inlet, facilitating oxygen production.Increasing the compressor speeds to increase the air mass flow andpressure gradient at the membrane denotes an increase in electricconsumption proportionally higher than the increase in oxygenproduction, increasing its price. Regarding production per energyconsumed, it has the same behaviour as the cost per productionbecause electric energy is solely employed in this case.For Case 2, an optimum point of oxygen production is found atHPEC maximum speed and a wastegate opening of 30% approxi-mately, ensuring a considerable pressure gradient inside themembrane and high air mass flows. Nevertheless, it represents acost of 61Vt1, which occurs due to the high thermal energy con-sumption as a consequence of maintaining a temperature of1000 C at the membrane inlet. Meanwhile, an optimum cost peroxygen production and oxygen produced per energy consumed isnot found for the studied limits. However, for a production of0.12 kg s1, a range of 33Vt1 to 38Vt1 is found, being profitablecompared with the average wholesale market price.Likewise, the operative feasibility of the cycle from an economicperspective is performed, identifying operation zones where thecost is lower than 50Vt1. For Case 1, it is found that the operationJ.R. Serrano, F.J. Arnau, L.M. García-Cuevas et al. Energy 255 (2022) 124419points where the HPEC speed is lower than 95% of its maximumspeed belong to the competitive zone with respect to the wholesalemarket price. Also, for Case 2, a competitive zone is found for aHPEC lower than 85% of its maximum speed, exhibiting a higherdependence of the waste gate valve opening that controls the T0mass flow. The production levels for Case 1 are lower than Case 2,while it is more profitable. Thus, depending on the availability ofenergy resources and the oxygen requirements, it is observed thatboth cases could be applied for applications like ceramic plants,showing acceptable profitability in awide range of operation pointsof the cycle.When comparing this oxygen production cycle using MIECmembranes with other methods in the literature, it is shown as aprice-competitive alternative when compared with the mostpromising method in development as it is CLAS. Additionally, thecycle produces an oxygen streamwith higher purity than the mostreliable method nowadays as it is CAS due the nature of the MIECmaterials with a perfect selectivity for oxygen.Declaration of competing interestThe authors declare that they have no known competingfinancial interests or personal relationships that could haveappeared to influence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgmentThis research work has been supported by Grant PDC2021-120821-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and byEuropean Union NextGenerationEU/PRTR.
