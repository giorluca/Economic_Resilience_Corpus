Abstract 
 
The global urbanisation rate had increased rapidly from just 30% in 1950 to 55% in 2018, and it is 
projected to reach 68% by 2050. This ongoing urbanisation shows the importance of building resilient 
economies in dealing with complex external financial and public health shocks and disturbances. 
Although most growing cities are beginning to demonstrate dedication to integrating sustainable 
development goals, building economic resilience in cities remains a significant challenge. During the past 
crises, stronger economies have shown an apparent ability to recover from shocks relatively quickly. 
Nonetheless, the severe COVID-19 recession has unmasked superficial evidence of economic resilience 
while also identifying underlying vulnerabilities and economic weak-spots. Accordingly, this paper 
focuses on resilience as a non-equilibrium property of urban economic structures. Focusing on two 
tropical cities, the paper explores sources of volatility transmission as indicators of urbanisation change, 
by utilising orthogonal impulse- response (OIR) functions based upon the Cholesky decomposition. The 
findings suggest a metropolitan disadvantage concerning urban economic resilience predominantly from 
shocks on sources of urbanisation.

1  Introduction  
 
The new millennium has witnessed widespread and frequent external shocks resulting in massive 
economic losses, depressions, and loss of lives. Noteworthy natural, financial, and public health crisis in 
the past 20 years include frequent large-scale natural disasters around the world on an annual basis, the 
bursting of the Dot-Com bubble in 2000-2002, SARS pandemic in 2002-2004, Global Financial Crisis 
(GFC) of 2008, MERS-CoV pandemic in 2012, European sovereign debt crisis (2009-2019), and COVID-
19 pandemic of 2020. These crises straddled broad geographic areas, adversely affected all economic 
sectors, hindered economic activities, and endangered lives and well-being worldwide. Although stronger 
economies have shown an apparent ability to recover from economic crises in the past relatively quickly, 
the severe COVID-19 recession has unmasked superficial evidence of economic resilience while also 
identifying underlying vulnerabilities and economic weak-spots.

In addition to frequent health and financial crises, the global urbanisation rate had increased rapidly from 
just 30% in 1950 to 55% in 2018, and it is projected to reach 68% by 2050  (United Nations, 2018a). 
Mass movements of people to cities result from several defining factors, including economic factors (such 
as job opportunities and higher disposable incomes), lifestyle preferences, health, and education. Swift 
expansion of cities geographic extent and urban clustering has led to extensive land recycling in many 
areas to suit urban life, adversely impacting the natural environment, agricultural landscapes, and resource 
allocations. Continuous and evolving urbanisation that primarily results from rural to urban migration is 
changing city structures and is altering the structure of the broader economy. 
North America is the most urbanised region in the world with 82% of its population living in urban areas, 
Latin America and the Caribbean comes in second place with 81%, Europe and Oceania follow suit with 
74%, and 68% in that order. The more balanced regions include Asia, with almost 50% urbanisation and 
Africa, with 43% of its population living in urban areas (United Nations, 2018b). This ongoing 
urbanisation shows the importance of building resilient economies in dealing with complex external 
financial and public health shocks and disturbances. And while most growing cities are beginning to 
demonstrate dedication to integrating sustainable development goals (Chaiechi, 2020a), building urban 
economic resilience remains a significant challenge.   
However, the relationship is not that simple. Urban agglomeration may induce and facilitate some 
economic activities; it may also lead to diseconomies of scale as business clusters may contribute to 
pollution and other negative externalities. Diseconomies of scale resulting from urban agglomeration lead 
to strong environmental pressures, price distortions, and inequalities, consequently jeopardising urban 
areas' resilience against external shocks. The urban economic theory suggests that concentration benefits 
can be offset by increasing congestion, overcrowding, and pressure on the environment. These negative 
externalities intensify as cities expand, especially without careful planning for resilience and future-
proofing.   
Moreover, a large body of literature often portrays an entirely predictable relationship between 
urbanisation and economic growth. Many of these arguments are mainly broad-brush, and the supporting 
evidence is rather insufficient. More importantly, the concept of urban economic resilience is rarely 
discussed in the literature, and its methods of quantification are poorly understood. Accordingly, this 
paper's main point of departure is to offer measuring techniques to quantify urban economic resilience by 
moving beyond decontextualised and limited research around the concept of economic resilience. 
In addition to the insufficient number of theoretical and empirical studies around the concept of economic 
resilience, regrettably, in many crisis scenarios, it has also become evident that policy-makers have 
resorted to short-term responses rather than adopting various approaches to building economic resilience, 
hugely compromising the purported rights of forthcoming generations.  
This paper focuses on resilience (as competence) as a non-equilibrium property of urban economic 
structures. The authors explore the sources of volatility transmission as indicators of urbanisation change, 
allowing us to investigate the urban economic resilience of selected cities in the presence of external 
shocks. Accordingly, this study is designed to assess the hypothesis that changes in indicators of 
urbanisation influence economic growth volatility transmission. The paper introduces an orthogonal 
impulse- response (OIR) function based upon the Cholesky decomposition under which condition all 
shocks are expected to be transitory, either around a deterministic trend or around some unconditional

mean. By calibrating the framework to time series quarterly data from 2001 to 2018, the paper finds the 
susceptibility of selected cities’ economic growth to external shocks on urbanisation indicators.  
 
 
2  Literature review   
 
Non-equilibrium economics explains events’ economic processes as a non-equilibrium phenomenon that 
stands against standard classical equilibrium economic theories. Most classical models focus on 
equilibrium conditions, and therefore, the concept of resilience does not naturally fit within classical 
theories. Integrating the concept of economic resilience into classical models would be challenging as it 
would provoke a paradigmatic change. However, frameworks and methods for out-of-equilibrium 
phenomena have been repeatedly presented in contemporary economic theories, including Post-
Keynesian economics and ecological economics. In this paper, without getting into these controversies, 
we focus on several seminal works that had helped improve the conceptual and theoretical understanding 
of economic resilience.  
2.1  Economic Resilience  
The concept of resilience has always been discussed in the United Nations Development agenda. For 
example, Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015 (United Nations, 2005) was first introduced in the 
World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan, in 2005 – only days after the 2004 Indian 
Ocean Tsunami. Another crucial UN report called "Resilient People, Resilient Planet – A Future Worth 
Choosing" was published in 2012. This report contains 56 recommendations to put sustainable 
development into practice through inclusive economic growth, environmental development and social 
equity (United Nations Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Global Sustainability, 2012).  
In academia, where there is an overall insufficient number of papers around resilience, several notable 
articles have discussed essential resilience dimensions in economic systems in details. Holling (1973) is 
one of the pioneers in the field who introduced resilience as a property of economic systems that 
determines the persistence of relationships within systems and is indicative of the ability of systems to 
absorb external shocks. Holling (1973) is indeed one of the early studies that attempted to invalidate the 
equilibrium-based economic theories put forward by classical economists. A couple of decades later, 
Mileti's Disaster by Design (1999) provided an alternative framework to view, investigate and manage 
environmental hazards to build disaster-resilience communities and economic sustainability. Mileti's work 
was well received amongst the researchers and policy-makers in the field of disaster and emergency 
management policy. 
Until the early 2010s, research on disasters and resilience was dominated by physical scientists. There 
was a lack of social sciences' contributions to the concept of resilience. As Mileti (1999, P1) quoted, 
White and Haas (1975) attempted to fill this void by advancing the “critical notion that rather than simply 
picking up the pieces after disasters, the nation could employ better planning, land use controls, and other 
preventive and mitigatory measures to reduce the toll in the first place” (Mileti, 1999, P1). 
Holling (1996) introduced “engineering resilience” that was particularly relevant in the field of material 
engineering and used as an indication for exemplary performance in tolerating stress and pressure. Socio-
ecological systems (SES) were first proposed as a tool to measure resilience by Berkes et al. (2003). This 
work inspired other seminal studies such as Fischer et al. (2006), and Cabell and Oelofse, (2012) that led 
to the conceptualisation of “ecological resilience”, a view built on the deliberation of the interaction 
62                                                                                                                   Taha Chaiechi  and Trang Nguyen 
 
between society and the environment through socio-ecological systems to build ecological resilience. 
Rose (2004) acknowledged three levels of difficulties (conceptual, operational, empirical) confronting 
researchers in the field of economic resilience, summarising progress in all three levels. Rose (2004) 
introduces two types of resilience: inherent resilience as an ability to operate under normal circumstances 
and adaptive resilience as the ability to remain functional during a crisis.  
2.2  Urbanisation and Economic Growth 
Historically, economic growth and urbanisation share a complex yet dynamic relationship tied to firms 
locations decisions (Alonso, 1964), infrastructure development (Bairoch, 1988), transport infrastructure 
(Harris & Ullman, 1945; Floyd & Allen, 2002), employment (Castells, 1977:237; Hoffmann et al., 2019), 
land rent and rural-urban wage disparity (Gale et al. 2005; Jiang et al.,2012; D'Costa & Overman, 2014; 
Deng et al., 2010), and commuting distance to work (Angel and Blei, 2016; Kim and Choi, 2019). 
While cities remain economic powerhouses of the countries, there seems to be a lack of research on 
achieving adaptive economic resilience in the cities.  Cadena et al. (2012) argued that some cities might 
decline as most cities continue to evolve and grow. This is all dependent on how well cities are positioned 
to mitigate the adverse effects of shifting economic landscapes. Capello et al. (2015) examined cities' role 
as sources of regional resilience in Europe using a scenario approach and simulation exercise. The paper 
found that e cities with more value-added activities, higher quality production factors, and more 
prominent network clusters exhibit the highest economic resilience.  
Rodríguez-Pose (2018) conducted a review of studies focusing on disparities between rural and urban 
areas in the EU and concluded that persistent poverty, economic inequality, and lack of economic 
opportunities are the driving forces behind declining areas. The paper recommended that territorial 
interventions should focus on large and dynamic cities and not on lagging regions, a view that is 
supportive of agglomeration. However, the study conducted by Dijkstra et al. (2015) argued that rate of 
urbanisation in large European cities relative to the rest of the country has stagnated or even reversed in 
many of the developed EU countries, a pattern that contradicts with urban growth of megacities elsewhere 
in the world. The study suggested that the polycentric urban structure in Europe favours a high number of 
small and medium-sized cities to megacities that could contribute to this negative trend. The study also 
found that improved access to services and technology (including broadband) across developed European 
countries might have improved smaller urban areas' appeal.  
There are positive economic implications for urbanisation. For example, urbanisation increases 
investment in public infrastructure, and the public transport system becomes more efficient, allowing city 
dwellers to live closer to hospitals, recreational and educational facilities (White et al., 2019). Firms 
located in city centres provide better-paying jobs than jobs offered in regional areas (Sanderson et al., 
2017). Also, firms tend to maximise social and technological connectivity benefits due to complex city 
structures (Sennet, 2002), resulting in knowledge generation and innovation. The process of gaining new 
knowledge leads to knowledge spillover to other firms located in or around city boundaries (Audretsch 
and Feldman 2004; Audretsch et al., 2015; Bakhtiari and Breunig, 2015), positively affecting workers 
productivity, inducing economic growth.

3  Geographic Scope of the study 
 
This paper focuses on two tropical cities. The primary reason for this selection is that Tropics is currently 
home to over 42% of the world's population (Harding et al., 2016), a rate estimated to reach more than 
50% by 2050 (State of the Tropics, 2014). Accordingly, tropical cities are swiftly expanding as more 
populations are relocating to these cities. Besides, the State of Tropics report (2014) also demonstrated 
that the Tropics' economic growth outperformed the rest of the world. In particular, this paper focuses on 
the tropical city of Cairns, Australia, and the city-state of Singapore.

Cairns is located in the Wet Tropics World Heritage Area in the eastern coastal tropics of Queensland. 
Cairns is a fast-growing city and is secluded from other major cities. Cairns' unique location means that 
the city needs local and state governments and town planners' attention to nurture constructive change to 
offer high-quality urban spaces and improve quality of life while providing economic opportunities. The 
city-state of Singapore is located near the equator. It has limited land and natural resources, with one of 
the highest urban population in Southeast Asia. Singapore's landscapes are continually evolving as urban 
planning and urban policies in Singapore guide modern Singapore's physical terrains. Despite Singapore 
being recognised as the most sustainable city in Asia and globally, it continues to face challenges given its 
land scarcity and rising population.   
 
4  Data, Data Sources, and Characteristics 
To investigate our selected cities' urban economic resilience, we follow Chaiechi (2020b), who modelled 
the urban economic growth process of two comparative case studies of Singapore and Cairns by 
constructing frameworks designed to illustrate complex the growth process identifying sets of relevant 
64                                                                                                                   Taha Chaiechi  and Trang Nguyen 
 
variables exclusive to each urban system.  It is important to note that each city's choice of variables 
depends on the existing literature and data availability. 
Accordingly, quarterly data on selected variables from 2001 to 2018 were retrieved from the Department 
of Statistics Singapore databases, Australian Bureau of Statistics, Cairns Regional Council and National 
Institute of Economic and Industry Research (NIEIR). All time-series data were adjusted for seasonality 
where appropriate to unveil the underlying base trends of the series. For the series of which only annual 
data are available, frequency conversion technique such as Quadratic Sum or Average Matched to the 
source were used to generate quarterly data from annual data. Table 1 presents two sets of indicators for 
urbanisation and economic growth in Singapore and Cairns (due to data availability).

Descriptive characteristics of all of the selected economic indicators for Singapore and Cairns cities are 
displayed in Table 2. Indicators with positive (negative) skewness imply that their distributions have 
thicker and longer right (left) tails than the Gaussian distribution. Most of the indicators showed kurtosis 
larger than 3, indicating the presence of leptokurtic distributions. Jarque-Bera statistics confirmed that 
most of the indicators are non-Gaussian distributed.

5  Analysis and Findings 
Consistent with this paper's main aim, which is to analyse and measure the urban economic resilience of 
two selected tropical cities, the paper adopts time series analysis techniques to develop impulse response 
functions offering a methodological advantage in interpreting results within a system approach. It is 
imperative to evaluate the times series’ characteristics primarily. Accordingly, in this section, diagnostic 
tests such as stationarity, causality (block exogeneity), cointegration, and stability tests are conducted to 
avoid any model misspecification.   
5.1 Stationarity 
Testing for stationarity before further analysis is essential because regression of non-stationary 
variables may instigate accumulated shocks in the system of equations, leading to permanent effects. As 
such, all variables were tested for stationarity at level I(0) and the first difference I(1) using standard unit 
root tests developed by Augmented Dickey and Fuller (1981), Phillips and Perron (1988) and Ng and 
Perron (2001). The results are reported in Appendix A, showing that most of the variables in the case of 
Singapore were stationary in both orders of integration, I(0) and I(1), while all variables in the case of 
Cairns became stationary in the first order of integration I(1). Therefore, all variables in both cases are 
used in their first differenced form before proceeding with subsequent analysis.     
5.2 Cointegration Test 
Since the endogenous variables for the cities of Singapore and Cairns, as determined in the 
previous section, were identified to be I(1), the cointegration relationship might exist between the 
variables. To test for the presence of such a relationship, the Johansen (1991) cointegration rank test was 
adopted. This test estimates the maximum likelihood of the coefficient matrix of a VAR model to identify 
the number of cointegration equations, was adopted. The test results are reported in Table 3, showing 
three cointegration relationships among the endogenous variables in Cairns' case. At the same time, there 
is no cointegration presence among the variables in the case of Singapore. Therefore, a VAR model and a 
VEC model that incorporates an error correction term should be a good fit for Singapore and Cairns' data, 
respectively.

5.3  Block Exogeneity Wald Test 
Exogeneity is a critical issue when adopting a VAR/VEC model. It may cause the model to be too 
restrictive, which then misleads the system variables' dynamic interactions. Thus, the Block Exogeneity 
Wald test was conducted to examine what variables should be included or excluded in the final models. 
As presented in Table 4, the null hypothesis of exogeneity or non-causality was rejected for the economic 
growth indicator and some of the urbanisation indicators, indicating that these indicators are endogenous 
and exhibit causality. Notably, in Singapore's case, the determined endogenous indicators are GDP, the 
number of registered business, electricity generation output, and the number of teachers in all educational 
organisations. In Cairns' case, the determined endogenous indicators are GRP, urban population, the 
number of registered businesses, employed residents and registered motor vehicles. These variables are 
valid to be included in a VAR/ VEC system and later will be imposed shocks for an impulse response 
analysis.

5.4  Lag Length Selection 
An optimal lag length procedure was followed to avoid over-parameterisation in the system of 
equations and serial correlation in the residuals. Using an optimal lag length helps ensure the consistency 
and reliability of the model estimations and the precision of impulse response analysis. All variables in 
the system were regressed with the same lag order, which was identified by different statistical 
information criteria such as LR (sequentially modified likelihood ratio), FPE (Final Prediction Error), 
AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), SC (Schwarz Information Criterion), and HQ (Hannan-Quinn 
Information Criterion). As indicated in Table 5, three reports that lag 4 were chosen by three out of five 
criteria (LR, FPE and AIC) for both Singapore and Cairns cases. Accordingly, a VAR/VEC model with 
Measuring urban economic resilience of two tropical cities, using impulse response analysis             67 
 
 
 
lag 4 was set up for both cases.  The adoption of higher lags was not considered to avoid a further 
reduction in the already low degrees of freedom due to the lack of sufficiently long time-series data.

5.5 Post-Estimation Diagnosis and Stability Condition  
According to the block exogeneity test and cointegration rank test results, a VAR model and a 
VEC model were established for the identified set of endogenous variables for Singapore and Cairns 
(reported in Appendix B). To avoid model misspecification, serial correlation and heteroscedasticity tests 
in the residuals were conducted. As reported in Table 6, the residuals serial correlation Lagrange 
Multiplier test statistics were statistically insignificant in both cases, indicating zero autocorrelation in the 
model residuals up to lag 15. The White Heteroscedasticity joint test results show that the two 
models' residuals were homoscedastic and independent with the regressors.

As such, the VAR and VEC models adopted for each city are a good fit for the corresponding set of 
endogenous variables. Furthermore, the two models' stability condition is also ensured because the 
models' AR invert roots lied within the unit circle, as depicted in Figure 2.

5.6  Impulse Response Analysis 
 
This section investigates urban economic resilience by measuring the economic growth indicator's long 
impulse responses to simulated external shocks imposed on urbanisation indicators. Using this method 
comes with the added benefit of empirically investigating the absorbability and recoverability of these 
selected cities' economic systems. The recovery speed is measured by variance decomposition 
(demonstrated in section 5.7), which shows how much of the forecast error variance of the economic 
growth indicator is explained by exogenous shocks to urbanisation indicators.  
 
The responses of cities' economic growth indicators to orthogonal shocks in urbanisation indicators are 
the main areas of interest in this section. Figures 3 and 4 depict urban economic growth's impulse 
responses to Cholesky one-standard-deviation shock on urbanisation sources over 30 quarters. The 
number of quarters before the response line crosses the zero baselines indicates the recovery speed after a 
shock, capturing these two tropical cities' relative economic resilience to external shocks.  
 
According to the response patterns in figure 3, economic growth in Singapore was immediately 
influenced by the orthogonal shocks of one-standard-deviation change in the number of registered 
businesses and electricity generation output. Shocks in these urbanisation indicators resulted in a 
significant oscillation of economic growth along the baseline for a relatively long period (up to 20 
quarters) before returning to pre-shock levels. Economic growth's response to a shock to the education

system indicator was more short-lived and lasted around ten quarters. The overall results indicate that 
one-standard-deviation shock to any of these sectors would generate a long-lasting impact on the urban 
economy of the city-state of Singapore.

The simulation results of the urbanisation changes in Cairns economic resilience indicate that the city 
economy would be susceptible to unpredicted shock from employment, number of registered businesses, 
number of registered motor vehicles and the city’s population. However, the economic instability caused 
by urbanisation shocks seems to be shorter-lived in Cairns than in Singapore as the impacts tend to 
weaken and dissipate after 12-14 quarters in the Cairns to 20 quarters in Singapore economy. The finding 
implies that the Cairns economy is more resilient to shocks arisen from urbanisation than Singapore 
economy. The result of Singapore’s impulse response analysis is not surprising; there have been recent 
reports explaining while Singapore’s economy is in good shape, it may not progressing quickly enough to 
allow economic growth to adjust to domestic and external shocks swiftly (Bhaskaran,2018). Some of the

. From the data point of view, as 
observed in Table 2, Singapore's GDP exhibits a significantly higher standard deviation (0.025) than that 
of Cairns' GRP (0.009), indicating Singapore's GDP is much more volatile compared to Cairns' GRP. 
Thus, when facing an external shock, Singapore's economy tends to be more volatile than the Cairns 
economy.  
5.7 Variance decomposition 
 
We use Cholesky variance decomposition, proposed by Sims (1980), as an identification scheme that 
creates a recursive contemporaneous ordering amongst the variables, meaning that variables do not 
depend contemporaneously on the variables that are ordered after. The idea is to measure the recovery or 
adjustment speed (as an essential aspect of resilience) amongst urbanisation indicators after “orthogonal” 
uncorrelated shocks. Drawing on our time series data, we utilised Sim’s Cholesky decomposition 
technique to measure our model variables' compositional speed adjustments in response to simulated 
shocks. Results are shown in table 7 and 8. The table columns give the forecast variance percentage due 
to orthogonal shocks, decomposing the total variance of those time series indicators into the percentages 
attributable to each shock. Each row adds up to 100. 
Results of variance decomposition of urbanisation indicators in Singapore is reported in Table 7. The 
results provide information about the relative importance of urbanisation indicators affecting urban 
economic growth. Findings indicate that compositional adjustment in economic growth indicator has been 
partial and limited, becoming stronger only when there is a shock to electricity generation output (ELG). 
In particular, the results reveal that only after five periods, the fluctuation in ELG itself explained 72.76% 
of its total variance, whereas the GDP accounted for 18.58%. This indicates that in our Singapore model, 
the energy sector and economic growth are strongly interconnected, and external shocks in energy 
production will influence the stability of the city's economic growth.

Table 8 reports the result of the variance decomposition of urbanisation indicators in Cairns. We find 
economic dynamism components, with sizeable adjustments in gross regional products (GRP) following 
external shocks to the number of employed residents (EMP) and the number of registered businesses 
(BIZ). Results of Table 8 reveal that only after five periods, the fluctuation in EMP itself explained only 
55.49% of its total variance, whereas the GRP and urban population (POP) accounted for 15.87% and 
25.09%, respectively. Similarly, BIZ's fluctuation explained only 39.14% of its total variance, whereas 
the GRP accounted for 48.62%.

This result confirms that both residents' employment and the number of registered urban businesses 
contribute the most to the Cairns’ economic growth variance despite their relatively small size in the 
overall Cairns portfolio. 
While impulse response analysis traces the effects of urbanisation indicators shocks on our selected cities' 
economic growth within a VAR system, variance decomposition analysis helped separate urbanisation 
indicators' variation into the component shocks to the VAR model. Impulse response analysis indicated 
that simulated shocks resulted in a significant oscillation of economic growth with a long-lasting impact

on Singapore's urban economy.  However, the economic instability caused by simulated shocks is 
predicted to be shorter-lived in Cairns, implying that Cairns’ economy is more resilient to external shocks 
arisen from urbanisation than Singapore’s economy. The variance decomposition results reveal further 
details about the relative importance of these simulated shocks in affecting sources of urban economic 
growth of our cities. The share of forecast-error variance attributable to urbanisation indicators in 
Singapore amounts to 7%-17% up to 10 years compared to their own innovation (71%-79%).  The 
compositional adjustment in cairns’ data indicates a shock to one urbanisation indicator records an 
increasing impact on other urbanisation indicators, ranging between 9%-40% ahead of their own 
innovation (29%-82%). The results indicate that while variance decomposition evolves over time, 
urbanisation indicators in Cairns are stronger in explaining other variables' variability over time than 
Singapore.   
 
6  Conclusion  
While cities are the nation's economic powerhouses, they are subjected continuously to frequent 
unforeseen large-scale external shocks, including natural, financial, and public health disasters. These 
disasters swiftly agitate economic activity levels, potentially leading to social and economic instabilities. 
The detrimental effects of such disasters are far from being local as urban economies are intricately 
interconnected, spreading the shocks quickly across regions and countries. Respectively, this outlook sets 
out the importance of building and quantifying economic resilience.  
Even though there have been limited advances in understanding economic resilience, the way resilience is 
measured remains in its infancy phase. More importantly, the concept of urban economic resilience is 
rarely discussed, and the concept is hardly quantified in the exiting literature. Accordingly, this paper's 
main point of departure is to offer methodology and techniques for measuring urban economic resilience 
that moves beyond decontextualised and limited research around the concept of urban economic 
resilience. While the existing literature suggests that strong relationships amongst any systems’ elements 
improve resilience, this paper provides a novel approach in measuring urban economic resilience by 
determining contemporaneous feedback effects, absorbability, and recoverability of urban systems against 
external shocks (i.e. impulse response analysis). Moreover, the paper provides the added benefit of 
empirically capturing dynamic interaction amongst the urban economic model variables by indicating the 
amount of information each variable contributes to the other variables within the system (i.e. variance 
decomposition analysis). 
Subsequently, this paper posits that urban economic growth determinants remain sensitive to 
changes/shocks to sources of urbanisation sources. The paper further postulates that urban economic 
resilience must be established at different levels to absorb these shocks and recover from detrimental 
effects relatively quickly. So from a novel perspective, this paper measures recoverability and speed of 
adjustment (as central aspects of resilience), using two tropical cities of Singapore and Cairns as case 
studies.  
By relying on times series quarterly data and utilising advanced econometrics techniques including 
impulse-response analysis and decomposition techniques, this paper identified not only how external 
shocks to sources of urbanisation affected the economic resilience of two selected cities, but also, and 
perhaps more crucially, how much of the forecast error variance of urban economic growth rate is 
explained by exogenous shocks to urbanisation variables. This paper's findings suggest a metropolitan 
74                                                                                                                   Taha Chaiechi  and Trang Nguyen 
 
disadvantage concerning urban economic resilience predominantly from shocks on sources of 
urbanisation. Nonetheless, the results call for further analysis to explore how these cities counterbalance 
urbanisation's adverse effects. Furthermore, this study faced a number of limitations. Firstly, there was a 
limitation at the regional and urban level with available data. Secondly, this study did not consider spatial 
urban economic inequality as different urban areas may deal with external shocks differently across urban 
spaces. Given the outlook for the future of swiftly expanding tropical cities, it is imperative to ask what 
would be the other source of urban economic resilience in the future.  
Finally, evidence-based policy-making (as opposed to ideology-based policy-making) is becoming more 
widely recognised and appreciated by governments worldwide. The need for systems to be informed by 
evidence at each stage of policy development is also becoming more acknowledged at government levels. 
Accordingly, the knowledge and evidence-based information provided in this paper should assist policy-
makers, city governments, and planners in designing a responsive and effective urban economy by truly 
understanding channels through which the sources of resilience are affected.  Furthermore, this paper's 
results around shock absorbability and recoverability of urban economies should provide policy-makers 
with opportunities to make city economies more resilient, particularly when dealing with complex 
problems such as natural disasters and public health emergencies.
