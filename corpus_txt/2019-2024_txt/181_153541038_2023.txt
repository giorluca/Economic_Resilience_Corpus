INTRODUCTION In the contemporary business landscape, navigating through political turbulence, particularly during pre-election periods, has emerged as a critical challenge for businesses globally. This phenomenon, characterized by heightened uncertainty and fluctuating economic conditions, significantly impacts business strategies and decision-making processes. The importance of this topic stems from the increasing frequency of political events that disrupt not only the political sphere but also the economic stability of nations. Pre-election periods, in particular, are often marked by policy changes, shifts in government priorities, and speculative market behaviors, all of which contribute to a  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           15 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  climate of uncertainty for businesses. The impact of such political events on the economy can be profound, influencing investment climates, consumer confidence, and overall market dynamics. Businesses, therefore, face the daunting task of developing strategies to mitigate these risks while capitalizing on potential opportunities. This challenge is further compounded by the globalized nature of modern economies, where political events in one region can have ripple effects across the world. The relevance of understanding how businesses can navigate through these turbulent times is underscored by the need for stability and growth in an increasingly interconnected and volatile global market. The study of pre-election economic conditions and their impact on businesses is not only academically significant but also crucial for practitioners who seek to develop robust strategies to withstand political fluctuations. This research aims to delve into the complexities of this subject, exploring how businesses can adapt and thrive in environments marked by political uncertainty. By examining the interplay between political events and economic conditions, this study seeks to provide insights into effective business strategies during turbulent times. The focus on pre-election periods offers a unique perspective on the anticipatory measures and adaptive strategies businesses can employ. This research is particularly timely, given the current global political climate, where elections and political changes are increasingly influencing economic policies and business environments. The study's contribution lies in its comprehensive analysis of the interdependencies between political events and business strategies, an area that has become increasingly relevant in today's dynamic world. Through this research, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of the economic implications of political turbulence and develop strategies to navigate these challenges effectively. The ultimate goal of this study is to equip businesses with the knowledge and tools necessary to make informed decisions in the face of political uncertainty, enhancing their resilience and competitiveness in the global market. In summary, this research provides a critical examination of the strategies businesses can adopt to navigate the economic uncertainties associated with political turbulence, particularly during pre-election periods, offering valuable insights for both academic and practical applications. The foundation of this study is established in the context of a global economic environment that is increasingly impacted by political dynamics, especially during the periods leading up to elections. These pre-election phases are often marked by heightened economic uncertainty and market volatility, making the understanding of these dynamics crucial for businesses. The study aims to explore how anticipatory political changes, investor sentiment, and potential shifts in policy direction contribute to economic fluctuations. It is recognized that these political events can significantly influence currency values, stock market performance, and consumer spending behaviors, thereby affecting the broader economic landscape. This research delves into the intricate relationship between political events and economic outcomes, seeking to unravel the complexities of this interplay. The importance of this exploration is highlighted by the challenges businesses face in strategic planning and forecasting during these turbulent times, where political landscapes can shift rapidly and unpredictably. The study also acknowledges the diverse impacts of political turbulence across different industries and  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           16 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  geographical regions, suggesting that a universal approach to understanding and managing these effects may be inadequate. By examining historical instances of how political events have shaped economic conditions, the research aims to provide a foundational understanding of current trends and patterns. This investigation is vital for businesses aiming to adapt and succeed in an environment where political and economic realms are deeply interconnected. Recognizing that political events are external factors beyond the control of individual businesses, the study emphasizes the importance of comprehending their potential impact for effective strategic planning and risk management. The core problem addressed in this study is the specific challenges businesses face amidst political and economic uncertainty, particularly during pre-election periods. This issue is of paramount importance as political turbulence can significantly disrupt market conditions, affecting business operations, investment decisions, and strategic planning. The relevance of this problem lies in its widespread impact on the business sector, necessitating a deeper understanding of effective adaptation strategies to maintain stability and growth. The primary objective of this literature review is to synthesize existing knowledge and insights on how businesses navigate through these uncertain times, identifying key economic indicators affected by political events and the strategies employed to mitigate associated risks. The research questions focus on understanding the relationship between pre-election political events and economic conditions, and how businesses can strategically adapt to these changes. The scope of this study is carefully defined to concentrate on the intersection of business strategy and political economics, specifically analyzing the impact of pre-election periods on business operations and the adaptive measures taken. This review is bounded by its focus on pre-election scenarios, providing a targeted exploration of the challenges and strategies pertinent to this specific context. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in its comprehensive analysis of the interplay between political events and business strategy, enriching the academic literature in both business and political fields. Practically, this review offers valuable insights for business practitioners and stakeholders, guiding them in developing informed strategies to navigate through political turbulence. By bridging the gap between theory and practice, this study aims to equip businesses with the knowledge and tools necessary to make strategic decisions in politically uncertain environments, enhancing their resilience and adaptability in the face of potential economic disruptions. In the realm of business strategy during periods of political turbulence, particularly pre-election, existing literature provides a foundation yet reveals significant gaps. Studies like those by Higashijima (2016) focus on political business cycles in authoritarian regimes, highlighting how political events can influence economic policies, but they do not extensively explore the direct impact on business strategies in diverse political systems. The research by Bovsh et al. (2023) on the restaurant business during the COVID-19 pandemic touches upon the external influences of political and economic conditions, yet it lacks a deeper exploration of strategic adaptations in broader business contexts during political elections. Similarly, the study by Tishchenko and Slavyantsev (2023) on cross-country coordination and reindustrialization provides insights into the  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           17 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  geopolitical and economic interplay, but it does not specifically address the challenges businesses face during pre-election periods. This gap is evident in the lack of comprehensive analysis on how businesses in different sectors and regions adapt their strategies in response to the economic uncertainties brought about by impending elections. While some studies address economic policy manipulation in authoritarian regimes or the impact of crises like the pandemic, there is a dearth of literature that holistically combines the political, economic, and strategic dimensions of business navigation during pre-election turbulence. Our research aims to fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of pre-election economic conditions and their impact on business strategies across various political environments. We seek to understand how businesses anticipate, react to, and strategize during these periods of heightened political uncertainty. This study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge by offering a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between political events and business strategy, particularly in the context of democratic systems where election outcomes can significantly sway economic policies and market sentiments.  B. METHOD The methodology of this literature review is meticulously designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of business strategies in the context of political turbulence, particularly during pre-election periods. This review adopts a systematic approach to literature selection, ensuring a thorough and unbiased examination of relevant academic sources. The primary focus is on peer-reviewed journal articles, books, and conference papers that discuss the interplay between political events, economic conditions, and business strategies. The time frame for the literature search spans from 2010 to 2023, allowing for an exploration of both contemporary and historical perspectives. The literature search involves multiple academic databases, including JSTOR, Google Scholar, and EBSCOhost, to ensure a wide range of sources are considered. Keywords such as "political turbulence," "pre-election economic conditions," "business adaptation strategies," and "political uncertainty in business" are used to refine the search. The selection criteria for literature include relevance to the research topic, academic rigor, and the contribution of the source to the field of business and political science. Sources are also evaluated based on their methodological soundness and the credibility of their findings. Once relevant literature is identified, a thematic analysis is conducted to categorize the findings into coherent themes. This involves a careful reading and coding of the literature to identify patterns, trends, and key insights related to business strategies during political turbulence. The analysis aims to uncover common strategies employed by businesses, the impact of political events on economic conditions, and the effectiveness of different adaptation approaches. The review also pays special attention to different geographical and industry contexts, recognizing that political and economic dynamics can vary significantly across regions and sectors. Comparative analysis is employed to understand how businesses in different settings respond to similar political challenges. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the topic and the identification of context-specific strategies. Ethical considerations, such as the proper  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           18 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  citation and acknowledgment of sources, are strictly adhered to throughout the review process. The methodology is designed to be transparent and replicable, allowing other researchers to understand and evaluate the process followed in this review. In summary, this literature review employs a systematic, comprehensive, and thematic approach to analyze the existing body of knowledge on business navigation in political turbulence. The methodology ensures that the review is thorough, unbiased, and relevant, providing valuable insights into the strategies businesses employ to adapt to pre-election economic conditions and political uncertainty.  C. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The literature review reveals that political turbulence, particularly during pre-election periods, significantly impacts economic conditions, manifesting in market volatility, investment uncertainty, and fluctuating consumer confidence. This phenomenon is observed globally, with political events leading to immediate and tangible effects on economic indicators such as stock market indices, foreign exchange rates, and overall economic growth. The review indicates that pre-election periods are often characterized by a heightened sense of uncertainty among investors and businesses, leading to cautious investment behaviors and a potential slowdown in economic activities. This is particularly evident in sectors sensitive to policy changes, where businesses may postpone major investments or expansion plans until the political climate stabilizes. Consumer behavior also tends to shift during these periods, with spending patterns becoming more conservative due to uncertainties about future economic policies and their personal financial implications. The literature suggests that the anticipation of potential changes in government and policy can lead to significant short-term disruptions in the economic environment, affecting both domestic and international markets. These disruptions are not limited to the countries experiencing elections but can have ripple effects in the global economy, especially in interconnected markets. The review also highlights that the impact of political turbulence on economic conditions can vary based on the nature of the political event, the stability of the political system, and the economic structure of the country in question. In economies with a history of political stability, the impact of pre-election turbulence may be less pronounced compared to those with volatile political histories. The findings underscore the importance for businesses and investors to closely monitor political developments as part of their economic forecasting and strategic planning processes. In summary, the review establishes a clear link between political turbulence and economic conditions, particularly in pre-election periods, emphasizing the need for businesses to be aware of and prepared for the potential economic impacts of political events. The literature review identifies a range of adaptation strategies employed by businesses during pre-election periods of political turbulence, highlighting the importance of strategic agility and foresight. It is observed that businesses often adopt a cautious approach, focusing on risk mitigation and maintaining operational flexibility. This includes diversifying investments and revenue streams to reduce dependency on politically sensitive markets or sectors. The review also reveals that many businesses  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           19 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  engage in scenario planning, preparing for various potential political outcomes and their corresponding economic impacts. This strategic planning enables businesses to respond swiftly and effectively to changing political landscapes. The literature suggests that effective communication with stakeholders, including investors, employees, and customers, is crucial during these times, as it helps maintain trust and manage expectations. Businesses are also found to increase their monitoring of political developments, using this information to inform their strategic decisions. The review highlights the role of predictive analytics in helping businesses anticipate market changes and adjust their strategies accordingly. Another key strategy identified is the strengthening of supply chain resilience, ensuring that businesses can maintain operations despite potential disruptions caused by political events. The literature indicates that businesses with a strong international presence may leverage their global footprint to mitigate risks associated with political turbulence in specific regions. Additionally, the review points out that businesses often engage in active lobbying and advocacy efforts to influence policy decisions and mitigate potential adverse impacts. The findings suggest that businesses that proactively adapt their strategies in anticipation of political events are better positioned to navigate economic uncertainties. In summary, the review underscores the diversity of adaptation strategies available to businesses facing political turbulence, emphasizing the need for strategic planning, flexibility, and proactive risk management to navigate the uncertain economic landscape of pre-election periods. The literature review reveals significant variations in how businesses across different industries and geographical regions respond to political turbulence during pre-election periods. It is evident that the impact of political events and the subsequent economic conditions are not uniform across sectors. Industries directly influenced by government policies, such as energy, healthcare, and defense, often exhibit heightened sensitivity to political changes. In contrast, sectors like technology and consumer goods might experience less direct impact but still need to navigate the broader economic fluctuations. Geographically, businesses operating in regions with a history of political instability or frequent regime changes face greater challenges in maintaining stability and predicting market trends. Conversely, in regions with stable political environments, the pre-election periods may present less volatility, allowing businesses to operate with more predictability. The review also highlights that multinational corporations often employ different strategies in different regions, adapting to local political and economic contexts. This adaptability is crucial for managing risks and capitalizing on opportunities that arise from the diverse impacts of political events. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), due to their limited resources, may find it more challenging to adapt to rapid political changes compared to larger corporations with more robust risk management frameworks. The literature suggests that the ability of businesses to effectively navigate pre-election turbulence is influenced by their understanding of local political dynamics, economic resilience, and the agility of their strategic response. In summary, the review underscores the importance of contextual understanding in business strategy  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           20 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  formulation during politically turbulent times, highlighting the need for tailored approaches based on industry characteristics and regional political climates. The literature review uncovers that political turbulence, especially during pre-election periods, exerts a profound influence on both investment and operational decisions within businesses. It is observed that political uncertainty often leads to a more cautious investment approach, with businesses tending to delay or scale down major investments until the political climate becomes clearer. This hesitancy is particularly pronounced in sectors that are heavily regulated or directly impacted by government policies. On the operational front, businesses are found to adopt flexible strategies to quickly adjust to changing economic scenarios. This includes altering supply chain logistics, revising sales forecasts, and even modifying product or service offerings in response to shifting consumer sentiments and market conditions. The review also highlights that businesses frequently reassess their risk management practices during these times, placing greater emphasis on identifying and mitigating potential political risks. The impact on human resources is notable, with companies often freezing hiring or deferring promotions and raises in anticipation of potential economic downturns. The literature suggests that businesses with a more global presence may shift their focus to less politically volatile markets to balance risks. Additionally, the review points out that businesses often increase their focus on liquidity management, ensuring adequate cash flow to weather potential economic disruptions. The findings indicate that the ability to make swift and informed operational adjustments is key to maintaining business continuity during periods of political uncertainty. In summary, the review underscores the significant impact of pre-election political turbulence on business investment and operational decisions, highlighting the need for agility and strategic foresight in navigating these challenges. The literature review culminates in the development of a series of recommendations for businesses to enhance their navigation strategies in the face of political turbulence, particularly during pre-election periods. These recommendations are derived from a synthesis of various studies and practical insights, emphasizing the need for proactive planning and adaptability. The review suggests that businesses should engage in continuous political monitoring to stay informed about potential policy changes and political developments. This includes leveraging political risk analysis tools and consulting with experts to better understand the implications of political events. The literature also recommends diversifying business operations and markets as a way to mitigate risks associated with political instability. This could involve expanding into new geographical regions or diversifying product lines to reduce dependency on any single market or sector. Strategic partnerships and alliances are highlighted as effective means to share risks and leverage collective strengths in uncertain times. The review underscores the importance of maintaining strong communication channels with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and investors, to manage expectations and build trust. Financial prudence is advised, with businesses encouraged to maintain robust financial reserves and flexible financial strategies to navigate economic fluctuations. The literature also points to the value of scenario planning, where businesses  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           21 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  develop various strategic responses based on different potential political outcomes. This approach allows for quicker adaptation to changing circumstances. Additionally, the review emphasizes the need for businesses to foster a culture of resilience and agility, where quick decision-making and flexibility are ingrained in the organizational ethos. In summary, the recommendations highlight a multifaceted approach to business strategy in politically turbulent times, focusing on risk mitigation, strategic flexibility, and proactive planning to navigate the uncertainties of pre-election economic conditions. DISCUSSION The analysis of the impact of political turbulence on economic conditions, as identified in our study, aligns with and extends the findings of existing literature, though with notable gaps. While Ozarow (2019) discusses the global economic crisis's impact on HR functions within global turbulence, it does not specifically address the nuanced effects of pre-election political events on broader economic indicators. Vitkovskaya (2022) examines large businesses' political strategies in small Russian towns, providing insights into the variability of business responses to political participation, yet it lacks a focus on the economic implications of these strategies during pre-election periods. Lykholat et al. (2021) highlight the influence of destructive factors like corruption on investment attractiveness in Ukraine, particularly in pre-election and post-election periods, but their study does not delve into the specific strategies businesses employ to navigate these challenges. Bovsh et al. (2023) focus on the restaurant business during the COVID-19 pandemic, touching upon external influences of political and economic conditions, yet their study does not explore strategic adaptations in broader business contexts during political elections. Our research fills a gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive analysis of how businesses across various sectors adapt their strategies in response to the economic uncertainties brought about by political turbulence. While existing studies address economic policy manipulation in authoritarian regimes or the impact of crises like the pandemic, there is a dearth of literature that holistically combines the political, economic, and strategic dimensions of business navigation during pre-election turbulence. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between political events and business strategy, particularly in democratic systems where election outcomes can significantly sway economic policies and market sentiments. The analysis of business adaptation strategies during political turbulence, particularly in pre-election periods, reveals a complex landscape that both aligns with and diverges from existing literature. While Higashijima (2016) explores political business cycles in dictatorships, focusing on economic policy manipulation, this does not directly address the strategic adaptations businesses make in democratic contexts. Bovsh et al. (2023) examine the restaurant business during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of external political and economic conditions, yet their study lacks a specific focus on pre-election scenarios. Tishchenko and Slavyantsev (2023) discuss cross-country coordination and reindustrialization, offering insights into geopolitical and economic interplay, but without a direct link to business strategies during political elections. Our research fills a gap by providing a detailed analysis of how  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           22 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  businesses adapt their strategies in response to the uncertainties of pre-election political turbulence. We find that while some studies address the broader impact of political events on economic conditions, there is limited literature that specifically focuses on the strategic business adaptations during such periods. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering insights into the diverse strategies businesses employ, particularly in democratic systems where election outcomes can significantly influence economic policies and market sentiments. This includes a focus on diversification, scenario planning, and stakeholder communication, which are crucial for navigating the uncertain economic landscape of pre-election periods. The analysis of variations in business responses to political turbulence across different industries and geographical regions, as identified in our study, is a complex area that both aligns with and diverges from existing literature. Schuurman's case study (n.d.) on Japanese manufacturers' trade policy stances provides insights into firm-level responses to policy issues, but it does not specifically address the variability of responses across different political contexts, such as pre-election periods. Bovsh et al. (2023) examine the restaurant business during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the impact of external political and economic conditions, yet their study lacks a specific focus on pre-election scenarios. Tishchenko and Slavyantsev (2023) discuss cross-country coordination and reindustrialization, offering insights into geopolitical and economic interplay, but without a direct link to business strategies during political elections. Beardsworth (2018) analyzes electoral coalition-building among opposition parties in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Uganda, providing a political perspective but not directly addressing business responses to these political dynamics. Our research fills a gap by providing a detailed analysis of how businesses adapt their strategies in response to the uncertainties of pre-election political turbulence. We find that while some studies, like Schuurman's, provide valuable insights into firm-specific attitudes toward policy issues, there is limited literature that focuses on the strategic adaptations of businesses across diverse industries and regions during political turbulence. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering insights into the diverse strategies businesses employ, particularly in democratic systems where election outcomes can significantly influence economic policies and market sentiments. The analysis of the impact of political turbulence on business investment and operational decisions, particularly during pre-election periods, reveals a multifaceted landscape that both aligns with and diverges from existing literature. Gerni et al. (2016) explore the impact of political business cycles on the real exchange rate volatility in Turkey, highlighting how political events can influence economic policies and, indirectly, business decisions. This aligns with our findings on the cautious approach businesses take towards investment during periods of political uncertainty. Kedziora et al. (2017) discuss the legal and economic issues in nearshore service transfers in the EU, providing insights into how businesses adapt operations in response to changing economic and political landscapes, resonating with our observations on operational adjustments. Dimitriou's work on the quantitative evaluation of transport infrastructure projects underlines the complexities in decision-making processes in large-scale investments,  ARTIKEL BRANDING: Jurnal Ilmiah Manajemen dan Bisnis           23 Jurusan Manajemen FEBI UIN Sunan Gunung Djati Bandung  https://www.journal.uinsgd.ac.id/index.php/branding  echoing our findings on the hesitancy in business investments during turbulent political periods. Our research fills a gap by providing a detailed analysis of how businesses specifically adapt their investment and operational strategies in response to the uncertainties of pre-election political turbulence. While some studies, like those by Gerni et al. (2016) and Kedziora et al. (2017), provide valuable insights into the broader economic impacts of political events, there is limited literature that focuses on the direct strategic adaptations of businesses during these periods. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering insights into the diverse strategies businesses employ, particularly in democratic systems where election outcomes can significantly influence economic policies and market sentiments. The analysis of recommendations for business strategy in pre-election political turbulence, as identified in our study, complements and extends the findings of existing literature, though with a limited number of directly related references. Bovsh et al. (2023) discuss the development of the restaurant business in Ukraine during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the importance of adapting business strategies in response to external political and economic conditions. This aligns with our findings on the necessity for businesses to adapt during periods of political turbulence. Beardsworth (2018) analyzes electoral coalition-building among opposition parties in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Uganda, providing a political perspective but not directly addressing business strategies in response to these political dynamics. Fox's research on Abraham Lincoln's approach to contract disputes and legal inefficiencies offers insights into strategic decision-making in a legal context, which indirectly relates to our study's focus on strategic business adaptations. Our research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by offering specific recommendations for businesses to navigate the uncertainties of pre-election political turbulence. While the studies by Bovsh et al. (2023) and Beardsworth (2018) provide valuable insights into the broader context of political and economic changes, there is a gap in literature that focuses on direct strategic recommendations for businesses during these periods. Our study addresses this gap by providing actionable strategies for businesses to maintain stability and seize opportunities in the face of political uncertainty.  D.
