A hardworking coal-miner in West Virginia who picked wild strawberries, raised his own hogs, cursed the rabbits and the birds for eating his tomatoes and cherries when it was my grandmother the whole time, saved the neighborhood stray dog from a terrible neighbor, and from time to time appreciated fine Appalachian moonshine, prohibition be damned. I think we would have gotten on quite well together.                       v  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  I am not sure how this journey would have panned out had I not had the good fortune of working with my advisor, Masoud Hashemi. Masoud gave me not only guidance, but also the freedom, respect, support, and resources to chase after my own ideas and ideals, both in the context of my research as well as in my overall professional growth and engagement. Many times, he challenged, encouraged, and facilitated me to achieve more than I thought I could or be better than I thought I was. He celebrated with me when I rose to the challenge, and he reminded me that, “it’s all part of your education,” when I fell short. I am deeply grateful for the candidness, humor, and warmth of his mentorship.  Appreciation is also due to Sarah Weis, who educated me about the finer details of both field and lab work. The extent of field and laboratory technical concepts and methods that she taught me is remarkable, and she inspires me to maintain a keen focus on the execution of every aspect of our experiments. In the summer before her retirement she still outpaced me in the field hauling 20-25 kg bundles of corn in 35°C temperatures. Her friendship and mentorship were so valuable and appreciated during this experience, and I am undoubtedly better for it.  My gratitude extends to every member of my committee. Wes Autio taught me biometry in my first semester and then continued to be a kind teacher for the nearly five years since to date. Especially as I wrote my thesis, he graciously offered refreshers and solutions to my statistical questions. Despite being a busy Department Head, he has been supportive and accessible all throughout my time as a graduate student. Rob Wick taught me everything I know about bacteria, fungi, and nematodes, good and bad and big and vi  small. He also taught me the joy in appreciating the wonders of biology even when it means the demise of your plant or vegetable crisper. My times in Fernald Hall investigating the microscopic world are a very fond memory, largely due to his teaching, humor, and joy in science. Dan Lass taught me the fundamentals of resource economics. His patience in teaching economic theory and application to a biology student has led me to a far better understanding and appreciation of the business-based systems I study. Heather Darby has been an incredible resource and partner. Her extensive and excellent body of research has been both humbling and inspiring, and I am thankful for the opportunity to work with her and receive her insights.  Neal Woodard, Zach Zenk, and Keith Lilly of the UMass Research Farm all helped execute the planting and maintenance of my experiments, and also contributed to the troubleshooting and decision making. They answered all of my many questions, shared lots of laughs, taught me how to drive a tractor, and often checked in on me.  The love, patience, and support of my friends and family has helped carry me through this experience, and my husband’s tireless commitment and support have been remarkable.  I would also like to thank the organizations and agencies that have provided support and funding for this work. Northeast SARE funded the research projects reported here, and they also provided a graduate student grant for additional research that I conducted. The UMass Center for Food, Agriculture, and the Environment also provided funding and resources. The Lotta M. Crabtree Fellowship provided stipend funding for nearly a third of my time as a graduate student. The UMass Plant Biology Gilgut vii  Fellowship as well as the Annie’s Sustainable Agriculture Scholarship also provided generous funding to support me and my research.                  viii  ABSTRACT  DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE FORAGE PRODUCTION STRATEGIES FOR ENHANCED ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC RESILIENCE ON NEW ENGLAND DAIRY FARMS  FEBRUARY 2020  SAMANTHA L. GLAZE-CORCORAN, B. S., FITCHBURG STATE UNIVERSITY,   Ph.D., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST   Directed by: Professor Masoud Hashemi  Cover crops are prized for their array of well documented and widely respected ecosystem services. Cover crops are an intrinsic part of building and sustaining soil health and thus the long term productive capacity of agricultural soils. However, effective cover crop adoption on New England dairy farms is lacking, and the benefits of traditional cover crops may be somewhat mismatched to the needs of dairy farms. Harvesting winter hardy small cereal grains for forage can provide practical incentive to farmers to incorporate effective cover crop management as well as provide an economic benefit in the form of additional on-farm forage production. In tandem, dual purpose cover crops can convey traditional ecosystem services while also helping to remove excess nitrogen and phosphorus applied in manure, thus providing enhanced nutrient cycling.    ix  TABLE OF CONTENTS                 Page ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS .................................................................................................v  ABSTRACT ..................................................................................................................... viii  LIST OF TABLES ........................................................................................................... xiv  LIST OF FIGURES ...........................................................................................................xv  CHAPTER  1.

Global food security and Green Revolution 2.0  The concept that we – as an agricultural and scientific community – must double yield production per land unit to feed the growing population is a pervasive point made by both public media and many scientists. However, this additional yield is only required to sustain increasing dairy and meat demands and biofuel production (Ray et al., 2013). In truth, the world already produces enough food to feed 10 billion people and yet still fails to address hunger and food security, as pointed out in a 2012 editorial (Holt-Giménez et al., 2012) citing Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports. The World Food Program USA (WFP) reiterates these claims and highlights that nearly one-third of all food is wasted, including food that expires in overstocked fridges or spoils on-farm due to failures in post-harvest management. Even more food rots in fields because adequate labor and technology (or economic incentive) are not available for the harvest. These are largely failures of logistics and a lack of synchrony between food production and post-harvest storage resources, processing capability, and food demand. The WFP interestingly characterizes the associated carbon consequences of food waste, stating, “if wasted food were a country, it would be the third largest producer of carbon dioxide in the world, after the U.S. and China” (WFP, 2019). The Holt-Giménez et al. editorial goes on to state that “agroecology and locally based food economics” are keys to food security, as identified in the global report generated by the International Assessment on Agriculture, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTED, 2009). The IAASTED was a three year project that assessed 2  agricultural knowledge, science, and technology (AKST) and the global capacity to meet food needs in the context of social equity and economic and environmental sustainability. In addition to the global report, the IAASTED generated five regional reports, including a North American and European (NAE) report. The NAE report notes that there is an abundance of food produced in this region due to extensive natural resources, wealth, and general lack of warfare or conflict. However, the report also outlines a variety of challenges. Despite great wealth and technology, this region struggles to provide equitable access to food. More specifically, in the United States 1 in 8 people are considered to be food insecure as they lack access to sufficient, affordable, and healthy food (Coleman et al., 2018). The IAASTED NEA report also challenges the region to improve the use of agriculture and its associated industries to support both rural and urban economies. Of course, the region must also adjust its agricultural practices to respond to – and mitigate - climate change. Yet, the NAE report found that less than 2% of the population in NAE countries are involved in primary food production. In addition to the responsibility of food production itself, this 2% bears a large burden of providing social goods to the general population. Farmers and industry affiliates are tasked with avoiding negative externalities by maintaining land, air, and water quality, and they are asked to contribute to social benefits by adopting practices that actively reduce climate change. This is a textbook shift of a social benefit onto private stakeholders’ cost of production (Field, 2016). In tandem, the NAE report calls to attention the “fragmented” dissemination of AKST to stakeholders, and advocates that stakeholders are often not able to influence AKST initiatives. This 2009 report echoes Nowak et al.’s 1996 paper about why farmers 3  do or do not adopt beneficial cultural management practices, such as those practices that could improve their economic outcomes and reduce their adverse environmental impacts. The paper is rooted in rural sociology and asserts that despite our collective advancements in technology and science, as well as improvements to policies, “we are still in the "horse and buggy" days of understanding and meeting farmers' needs as defined by the farmer.” The paper goes on to suggest that unsuccessful “educate, regulate, or bribe” approaches are consistently used in attempts to influence farmers to make changes (Nowak et al., 1996). Clearly, farmer adoption of efficient and sustainable cultural management practices is a cornerstone of long-term, global food security in all regions of the world. Furthermore, effective management practices are absolutely necessary in order to make use of the genetic advancements propelled by the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution produced famously large yield increases in staple crops that in resulted in increased food production, increased food affordability, and reduced global hunger. For example, cereal yields tripled in the years following the Green Revolution while only 30% more land was used to produce these yields; I.e. substantially more production was achieved per land unit (Wik et al., 2008). In order bring these gains to fruition, Norman Borlaug himself agreed with the critical importance of management practices: We believe that there has tended to be too much focus on the high-yielding varieties themselves, as if they alone can produce miraculous results. Certainly, modern varieties can shift yield curves higher due to more efficient plant architecture and the incorporation of genetic sources of disease and insect resistance. However, modern, disease-resistant varieties can only achieve their genetic yield potential if systematic changes are also made in crop management, such as in dates and rates of planting, fertilization, water management, and weed and pest control. Moreover, many of these crop management changes must be applied simultaneously if the genetic yield potential of modern varieties is to be fully realized (Borlaug and Dowswell, 2005). 4   Alas, all pendulums swing with less vigor over time. So, too, has the Green Revolution seen the fading energy of its once broad swing. Ray et al.’s 2013 metanalysis compiled 2.5 million data points and found global evidence of slowing or stagnating yield increases for maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza spp.), wheat (Triticum spp.), and soybean (Glycine max). Such trends, as well as the benefit of hindsight in evaluating the negative – albeit unintended – consequences of the Green Revolution, have resulted in a call for Green Revolution 2.0 that jump starts a new wave of agricultural advancement that reconsiders our strategy to feed the world’s population with a fresh, keen focus on environmental implications and appropriate management practices, as reviewed by Pingali in 2012.  Pingali suggests that the unintended environmental consequences associated with the Green Revolution, such as land degradation (Gomeiro, 2016; Lal, 2015), pest resistance, land contamination (Pimental, 1996), increasing energy demands, and water contamination (Singh, 2000) are in part caused by intensification practices themselves. While tillage, fertilizer inputs, various pesticides, and bare soils have caused the problems, the majority of responsibility may be more rightfully attributed to the inappropriate polices and management recommendations, as well as a lack of applied research, that scaffolded these intensification practices. Additionally, land degradation itself, as result of intensification of management practices associated with the high yielding varieties of the Green Revolution, is in part responsible for slowing yield progress. In outlining the Green Revolution 2.0, Pingali stiches with the same thread as Borlaug, stating, “…technologies to increase input use efficiency and improve 5  management practices are necessary to ensure the competitiveness and sustainability of production systems.” A comprehensive approach is necessary for the Green Revolution 2.0, an agricultural renaissance as Pingali calls it. Genetic and technological advancements will certainly remain critical players. However, the scientific community must take advantage of hindsight. Moving forward, we need to focus on appropriate management practices for advancing agricultural technologies and to inform policy. Most importantly, the proverbial technology and management package must also balance farmers’ needs for practical logistics and economics while maintaining environmental quality. 1.2 Agricultural land loss in the United States Urban development significantly reduces crop land around the world (Bringezu et al., 2014). In the United States, arable land has been reduced by approximately 20% since 1969 (figure 1.1), (Trading Economics, 2019). In 2018, American Farmland Trust (Sorensen, et al., 2018) released a widely cited report that found the majority of development from 1992-2012 took place on agricultural lands (figure 1.2). Compared to residential development, urban development had the greatest impact on converting agricultural land (figure 1.3), and 70% of all urban growth occurred Figure 1.1 20% of the arable land in the United States has been lost since 1969 (figure generated from Trading Economics, 2019). 6  on agricultural land (figure 1.4). In this context, urban development includes densely populated areas as well as associated technology and infrastructure to sustain urban populations.  Moreover, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicts that U.S. agricultural systems will continue to experience growing production pressure to meet both domestic and export demands (O’Donoghue et al., 2011). Maintaining national food security, contributing to global food security, and participating in the export market all require more efficient land use to offset U.S. urban growth. 1.3 Northeast Land Use   In the U.S., the Northeast – particularly the Boston area and southern New England – is predicted to be a hot spot of urbanization by Figure 1.2 (top) U.S. development on agricultural lands. Figure 1.3 (center) Residential and urban development on agricultural lands in the U.S. Figure 1.4 (bottom) Urban development on agricultural lands. All data sourced from American Farmland Trust, 2018. 7  2030 (Seto et al., 2012). However, Donahue et al.’s 2014 report, A New England Food Vision, highlights that New England currently produces only 10% of its food. The region also has a child food insecurity rate greater than 15%, which is greater than the average for the total population (Higgins, A., 2014). To improve local food security and long-term economic and environmental resiliency, A New England Food Vision proposes a plan to produce nearly 50% of the region’s food. Notably, the vision also calls for 100% of the region’s dairy and beef consumption to be met by local production.  This overall vision falls in line with Holt-Giménez et al.’s advocation for “agroecology and locally based food economics” and the conclusions of the IAASTED NAE assessment. New England regionalism as a major food movement to build food security and build a healthy population, economy, and environment, as reviewed by Ruhf (2015), is in fact supported by numerous public, private, and scientific agricultural organizations and professionals throughout the region.  1.4 New England dairies  To improve regional food security and meet the dairy production goals proposed by the New England Food Vision, the region would need to double milk production, which is estimated to require 2.7 million additional acres for feed and forage production. Easier said than done. Such an effort would require the reversal of decades of closing dairies. In the 1960’s the Northeast boasted 110,000 dairy farms, but that number dropped to just 20,000 in 2006, a 138% reduction (Winsten et al., 2000). This result is in part in response to changing markets and volatile milk prices that make long-term planning and capital investments challenging endeavors for farmers. Smaller farms that cannot absorb the milk price fluctuations have closed while the remaining farms 8  increased in size (MacDonald et al., 2007). And, at present, Vermont is the only New England state that USDA considers to be a major milk producer; the state posted decreasing productivity numbers (-2.1% milk per cow) in 2018 while 21 of the 22 other major milk producing states posted gains (National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2018). The only other major milk producing state that experienced decreases was Florida. Restoring dairy production and building regional resiliency requires that major hurdles for dairy producers be addressed: 1. feed is the largest annual production expense on nearly all New England dairies (figure 1.5); 2. climate change necessitates refined management practices to maintain and improve forage production yields; 3. soil health must be built to protect long-term production capacity; 4. management practices should Figure 1.5 Feed, labor, crop inputs, and fuel are among the primary annual expenses on dairy farms. Feed is the greatest expense by a wide margin. Figure created from data reported by Lidback and Laughton (2012), Laughton (2014), Laughton and Zwiegibaum (2015), and Laughton (2017 and 2019). 9  enhance economic resiliency; 5. Research and recommendations must be informed by, and in response to, the needs of the farmers. The challenge in enhancing dairy production in this region is real. However, the payout extends beyond food security for those that need more convincing. Dairy production and processing is the largest agricultural sector in the Northeast and provides over 32,000 jobs. In the state of Massachusetts alone, dairy processing is responsible for $2.5 billion in products and over 8,000 jobs – that’s 25% of all dairy-associated jobs in the Northeast (Lopez and Laughton, 2012). There is good news for our New England dairy systems. Corn silage is a primary source of feed for New England dairies and only occupies land ~5 months of the year. This leaves time and space for double cropping. Double cropping is the practice of growing two crops on the same field in the same year and is considered to be a form of agricultural intensification. As reported by USDA, corn silage production systems are a good candidate for double cropping, with farmers in the north central United States double cropping with winter rye for grain production and some Northeast farmers exploring double cropping with rye for silage (Borchers et al., 2014).  Growing more forage on less land, and increasing profitability per acre, is exactly what the doctor calls for in order to sustain and expand dairy production in New England. This approach is also part of the solution for improving global food production logistics and enhancing land productivity on existing, arable land. In New England, the questions are how this land productivity strategy will fit into farmers’ existing rotations and     production practices, and can we accommodate agricultural intensification without sacrificing environmental sustainability? 10  1.5 Forage production: corn silage As aforementioned, among the direct costs of production – such as feed, labor, fuel, and crop inputs – feed is by far the largest annual expense on nearly all New England dairy farms (figure 1.5) and is also a substantial expense on most livestock production operations. In the Northeast in 2018 it was estimated to cost $1630 to feed one animal for a year (Laughton, 2019). For farms with 100-500 cows, a typical range in New England (MacDonald et al. 2007), this bill quickly balloons to $163,000 - $815,000 per year. Farms that can increase on-site forage production can reduce the costs associated with purchasing supplemental forage off-farm. Diversifying forage production strategies can also offer risk management in the event of poor corn silage yields and build in some resilience to fluctuation of milk prices and changing climate conditions. It is predicted that the effects of climate change in the Northeast will result in greater risk of summer drought. This is of concern in this region where corn silage is rain fed. Likewise, it is predicted that additional precipitation will fall in the spring and fall months. Integrating double cropping strategies that take advantage of this precipitation can help compensate for potential corn yield penalties in drought years.  However, it is important to preserve the quality and yield performance of corn silage when considering double cropping in this system in order to elicit farmer adoption. In 2018, corn silage was planted on 60 thousand hectares in New England and produced an estimated 2.7 billion megagrams of forage (National Agricultural Statistic Service, 2019). As reviewed by Grant and Ferraretto (2018), corn silage is favored for its high yields and ration composition as it provides digestible fiber in the stover and protein in 11  the ear. Corn silage, as well as silage made from annual grasses such as rye or silage made from perennial hayfields, is also desirable for the effective preservation of nutrients and ease of feeding. Currently, many dairy farmers in New England and the Northeast at large err on the side of planting corn hybrid varieties with longer relative maturities that push the end-of-season corn silage harvest into late September through late October. The interpretation of what is considered to be a short season, mid-season, or long season relative maturity is subject to some interpretation. Generally speaking, long season hybrids have a relative maturity of 100-114+ days, mid-season hybrids have a relative maturity of 90-100 days, and a short-season hybrid has a relative maturity of <90 days.                       Farmers often favor longer season hybrids because these hybrids are perceived to result in greater yields than shorter season or mid-season hybrids. However, years of corn hybrid trials reveal that there are nominal yield differences influenced by relative maturity alone (table 1.1), (Corcoran and Hashemi, 2015).  Rather, there are excellent Table 1.1 Corn hybrid trails reveal minimal differences between shorter season and longer season corn hybrids in terms of biomass production (Corcoran and Hashemi, 2015). 12  hybrids in all categories, and it is important to conduct and consult hybrid trials when selecting corn hybrids for use on-farm.  From a physiological perspective, it does make sense for farmers to propose concerns about corn hybrids with a shorter relative maturity. It is completely logical to hypothesize that a crop that reaches maturity faster has less time to acquire carbon, water, and nutrients that can in turn manifest as quality biomass production. For these short or mid-season varieties to outperform varieties with extended relative maturities, the short and mid-season varieties must presumably have different water use efficiency or nutrient use efficiency dynamics. However, protection of intellectual property and the genetics embedded in these hybrids does indeed make assessment of their performance difficult and impedes the elicitation of general trends associated with the hybrid classes.    1.6 Manure and cover crops on dairy farms  Alas, the reader may find themselves wondering, why might agricultural service providers and scientists encourage farmers to use short or mid-season corn varieties in climates with adequate growing seasons to sustain longer season varieties? As we consider our agricultural production systems for what they are, systems, we must remember that corn is only piece of the dynamic management of dairy production. Prior to corn planting in the spring and following corn harvest in the late summer through early fall, fields will receive manure applications. Manure is applied both for fertility but also as a logistical necessity.  Dairy cows spend a notable amount of time in the barn in order to facilitate milking. This results in accumulation of both the solid and liquid components of their 13  manure that are regularly removed and stored. The manure is primarily stored in pits that are also open to rainfall that in turn increases the volume of the manure product. Most dairy farms in this region have the capacity to store only several months of manure (NRCS, 2003). Following cold winters spent with cows tucked in the barn, winter-accumulated manure is applied to fields in the spring. The manure that accumulates in the spring and summer months must be applied to fields in the fall in order to create maximum space for winter storage needs. Thus, the cycling continues in this way year after year. For some farms, this cycle has been ongoing for 100 years or more.  The challenge with this method is that logistical necessity gets the best of biological balance. First, the phosphorus applied in manure is in excess of corn uptake capacities (Carpenter et al., 1999). In other words, more phosphorus is applied to the fields than the corn can possibly remove. Second, fall manure applications often occurs in the absence of any crop to capture the environmentally important nitrogen and phosphorus. Hopefully a cover crop will be planted in the fall, but the timely planting date of the cover crop is important if it is to effectively capture nutrients and provide the ecosystem services for which cover crops are famous. 1.6.1 Nitrogen   Nitrogen is arguably the slipperiest of plant-essential nutrients, as reviewed by Cameron et al. (2013). When manure is applied, nitrogen enters the field as nitrate, ammonia, ammonium, and in organic matter. Ammonia must be converted to ammonium or nitrate in order to be used by plants. Plants can uptake nitrogen is the form of the positively charged ammonium cation or the negatively charged nitrate anion. Ammonia is highly subject to loss by volatilization before conversion via nitrification. While plants 14  can take up nitrogen in the form of ammonium, ammonium is also converted to nitrate in the soil via the nitrification process. Negatively charged nitrate ions do not bind to the negatively charged soil matrix and are also water soluble.  The combination of these two chemical characteristics come to mean that nitrate is highly subject to leaching and loss as it moves down the soil profile with water drainage. When nitrogen as nitrate is lost in this way, the best case scenario is the nitrate pools and remains low in the soil profile where plant roots cannot reach it. The worst case scenario is that the nitrogen enters ground water as it moves down the soil profile or that it runs-off from the topsoil with water during precipitation and snow melt events and then enters waterbodies.  When nitrogen is lost from the field system there are four distinct consequences. First, nitrous oxide volatilization from incomplete nitrification of ammonium can contribute to greenhouse gas production and climate change (Mosier, 1994). Second, ammonia volatilization reduces air quality, can lead to acidification of land and water when it reacts with humidity and the air, and contributes to fertilizer inefficiencies (Faulkner and Shaw, 2008). Third, when nitrate nitrogen leaches or runs off with sediment erosion and enters water bodies it pollutes fresh-water resources and contributes to ecological destruction (Singh and Sekhon, 1979; Switzer-Howse and Coote, 1984). Fourth, loss of nitrogen means loss of a resource that is energy intensive to produce (Modak, 2011). Like anything you spend good money on, we should be upset when we lose nitrogen that we have spent fossil fuels to produce, ship, and apply. 15  1.6.2 Phosphorus Phosphorus is of comparative necessity to nitrogen to support plant growth. However, its chemical characteristics create an opposite panel of potential problems. Phosphorus in the form of plant-available orthophosphate is likely to become fixed in the soil overtime (Barrow, 2017). The orthophosphate molecule can bind with iron and aluminum and result in conversion of phosphorus to plant-unavailable forms in the naturally acidic soils of New England. The loss of phosphorus in the orthophosphate form to fixed and unavailable forms that cannot practically be recovered may be even more concerning than wasteful nitrogen losses.   In addition, phosphorus in the form of orthophosphate in the soil could easily be washed into water bodies during erosion events (figure 1.6) and result in devastating eutrophication (Daniel et al., 1998). Conversely, phosphorus that becomes fixed with Figure 1.6 Extensive soil erosion occurs in the spring following snow melt and seasonal rains; the fields were not cover cropped and abut a water way. Author’s photos. 16  aluminum or iron is a wasteful loss of this limited nutrient. Orthophosphate fertilizers are applied as rock phosphate, which is a non-renewable resource. It is suggested
