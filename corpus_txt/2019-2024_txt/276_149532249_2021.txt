In attempting to predict the impact of major ecological or climatic change on livelihoods, insights can be gained bylooking at communities who experience extreme seasonal or annual variation. Here, we compare the ecology, economy, and socialnetwork of a community of traditional fishers in the Brazilian Pantanal between the dry season and the flood season in which theirwetland ecosystem is transformed. Using data derived from satellite imaging we show that during the flood season of 2019 the totalamount of open water accessible to fishers more than doubled and led to drastic qualitative changes. We show that although fishersadapted to this extreme seasonality by changing where, how, and what they fish between seasons, the structure of the social networkin our study community did not differ. We argue that strong networks are especially important in social-ecological systems with extremeseasonal changes. More generally, we suggest that case studies of seasonal adaptation such as ours can contribute to a broaderunderstanding of how communities may be able to successfully adapt to novel social-ecological changes.Key Words: fisheries; resilience; social-ecological systems; socio-networks; the PantanalINTRODUCTIONUnderstanding the resilience of local communities is a crucialpart of sustainability science (Linkov et al. 2014) and is vital ifwe want to predict how habitat loss (Lewis and Maslin 2015,IPBES 2019), climate change (IPCC 2018), large infrastructureprojects (Winemiller et al. 2016), and agrarian change (Borrasand Franco 2012) are likely to affect the millions of small-scalecommunities whose livelihoods depend directly on naturalresources. Such communities protect over 25% of globalecosystems (Garnett et al. 2018) and at least 36% of the intactforest landscapes (Fa et al. 2020). One of the major barriers tothis understanding, however, is our limited knowledge of howdifferent aspects of resilience play out on the ground in face ofenvironmental change (Clark and Harley 2019).  Community resilience can be achieved either through the processof adaptation, which allows the community to retain the samefunction, structure identity and feedback despite ecologicalchange (Walker et al. 2004) or through a process oftransformation in which the community modifies their way of lifewhen ecological change makes the existing system unsustainable(Folke et al. 2010). Adaptation and transformation are usuallyachieved through changes in economic behavior, socialorganization, and institutional arrangements. For example, theability to engage flexibly in wage-labor, trading, and otheractivities has been argued to be important in allowing somecommunities of Agta foragers in the northern Philippines tomaintain their livelihood in the face of reduced hunting andfishing returns (Minter 2010, Dyble et al. 2019). Similarly,previous experience with alternative economic activities appearsto be a key factor in determining whether communities are ableto avoid economic “lock-ins” in the face of the increasedfrequency of El Niño events in the Global South (Whitfield et al.2019). In the social domain, the ability to change group size andcomposition is often an important part of resilience. For example,pastoralists in northern Mongolia re-group every 5 to 10 yearsafter facing extreme winter storms, and later disperse again (Clarkand Crabtree 2015). Similar “multilevel” or “fusion and fission”patterns have been described for many pastoralist and foragersocieties and play an important role in adapting to seasonalchange (Kelly 2013, Thomas et al. 2015, Dyble et al. 2016, Birdet al. 2019). Some authors consider robustness (the ability tomaintain the characteristics of the systems in of face of externalor/and internal drivers of change) as part of resilience (Levin andLubchenco 2008)  The ability of a community to adapt or transform their way oflife also depends on existing cultural norms and social structure.Even if  we are to consider individuals to be rational actors whotry to maximize economic returns, most will be attempting to doso as part of social groups (Monk et al. 2018) and access to naturalresources is often mediated by friendship, status, age, andhistorical relationships and privileges (Ribot and Peluso 2009).In addition to this, de jure institutions may either reinforce oroverride what has been negotiated on the ground, changing theway people adapt, transform, or maintain their social-ecologicalsystem (Benjaminsen and Lund 2002). The relationship betweenlocal institutional arrangements and state institutions oftendetermines the success of adaptation or transformation(Robinson et al. 2018).  1Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Conservation Ecology Center, Virginia, USA, 2Imperial College London - Center for EnvironmentalPolicy, 3IPE - Institute of Ecological Research, 4IBAMA, Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, Brasília - DF,Brazil, 5National Center for Monitoring and Environmental Information from Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable NaturalResources, CENIMA/IBAMA, Brasília - DF, Brazil, 6Academia Nacional de Ciencias de Bolivia, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, 7FederalUniversity of Santa Catarina, Florianópolis-SC, Brazil, 8Department of Anthropology, University College London, London, UKEcology and Society 26(2): 30https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art30/Despite these complexities, many management interventionsaimed at ensuring the sustainability of resource-dependentcommunities are still focused on relatively simplistic approaches(Ostrom 2007, Wilson 2017). In the management of inlandfisheries, for instance, management strategies are focused on catchstatistics and intake and outtake policies based on models ofsingle species used by a homogenous group (Allan et al. 2005) andthat ignore the presence of recreational fisheries, dispersedlandings, diversity of fishing gear, and livelihoods, mobility, andseasonal changes (Cowx et al. 2004), creating a mismatch betweenlocal social-ecological dynamics and external interventions(Cooke et al. 2016). The examples, in fact, go beyond inlandfisheries, encompassing mobile pastoralists (Derry and Boone2010), swidden cultivators (Dressler et al. 2010), farmers, hunter-gatherers (Pyhälä et al. 2019), among others. Evidence shows thatmanagement strategies that are not in tune with local dynamicscan an increase marginalization, gender inequality, foodinsecurity, morbidity and mortality, social disarticulation, andeven the contravention of human rights through violent evictionor/and environment impact (Sikor and Lund 2009). A betterunderstanding of resilience dynamics is therefore important bothin reaching sustainable development goals and advancing theinternational environmental and development agenda moregenerally (Griggs et al. 2014).  Here, we sought to understand economic and social responses tomarked seasonal variation among a community of fishers livingin the Pantanal wetland. Our study community, Barra do SãoLourenço, inhabit an environment in which annual floods andstochastic vegetation movements completely transform theenvironment each year and make the location of productivefishing sites highly unpredictable both within and betweenseasons and years (Chiaravalloti 2019). We quantified seasonaldifferences in the ecology, fishing practices, and social networksof the Barra do São Lourenço community, providing aquantitative case study of how this community responds toecological changes.METHODSStudy areaThe Pantanal wetland, located in the center of South Americaand largely in Brazil, is the largest and most conserved wetlandin the world, covering 17,930km² and with 80% of its originalvegetation still standing (Junk et al. 2006). Recently, however, theregion has seen a growing threat from infrastructure projects,intensification of cattle ranching, and wildfires that, in 2020,devastated the Pantanal, destroying an estimated 30% of the totalbiome (Tomas et al. 2019, LASA 2020).The Barra do São Lourenço communityOur study community is the Barra do São Lourenço fishingcommunity, located around 150 km north of the port town ofCorumbá, Brazil. With a total population of 16 households (95people), they have strong Amerindian roots, but have alsoassimilated migrants who came to the region during waves ofcolonization or social change, including formerly enslavedpeoples and Paraguayans. Today, members of this community,regardless of ancestry, carry a distinct identity, referringthemselves as “ribeirinhos”: those who fish and live by the river(Chiaravalloti 2019). According to the Brazilian National Policyfor Sustainable Development of Traditional Peoples andCommunities (decree number 6040, 2007), they are categorizedas a “traditional people,” which, in principle, legally guaranteestenure rights to their traditional territory (Almeida and Silva2012).  Fishing is the main livelihood of up to 80% of the households(Chiaravalloti 2019). Fishing is mainly focused on two species ofcatfish, pintado (Pseudoplatystoma corruscans) and cachara (Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum), and one species of scaly fish pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus); together they represent over 80% ofall catch in the region (Catella et al. 2014). Local people alsogather bait for sport fishing tourists, mainly a small lungfishnamed tuvira (Gymnotus spp.) and the Pantanal crab (Dilocarcinuspagei; Costa and Lucato 2000). Although local people fish fortheir own consumption, the majority of their catch is sold tomiddlemen or in the city of Corumbá and they are therefore bestclassified economically as being small-scale commercial fishers(Catella et al. 2014; Fig 1).Fig. 1. The location of Barra do São Lourenço community withthe boundaries of their territory.Ecological dynamicsThe availability and distribution of natural resources in thePantanal is dictated in large part by the annual flood pulse (Junket al. 2011). Because of the slight gradient of the terrain in thePantanal (2–3 cm/km north to south; 5–25 cm/km east to west)the flood pulse takes 3–4 months to pass through (Junk et al.2006). The extent and duration of the annual floods in the regionmay change depending on a combination of precipitation, waterflow, and drainage in the surrounding highlands. Across years,the total flooded area can vary by an order of magnitude, fromapproximately 11,000 km² to 110,000 km² (Hamilton et al. 1996).For small-scale pantaneiro fishers, the location of fish or baitduring and after the flood pulse is highly uncertain because fishingor gathering grounds are typically only accessible and profitablefor a few days because of the moving flood pulse and the presenceof floating vegetation mats whose movements regularly block oropen water bodies in an unpredictable way (Pott et al. 2011,Chiaravalloti 2017a). As a further complication, the Barra do SãoLourenço community is located close to the confluence of twoEcology and Society 26(2): 30https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art30/large rivers (Paraguay and São Lourenço rivers) that differmarkedly in hydrology, enhancing the already unpredictablenature of the biodiversity distribution and availability(Chiaravalloti 2017b, Chiaravalloti and Dyble 2019).Governance and institutional arrangementsPrevious studies in the Pantanal have shown that the governancesystem of fishers from the Barra do São Lourenço communityshould be classified as a hybrid between open property andcommon property regimes, named “limited open access”(Chiaravalloti and Dyble 2019). In this system, fishers survive bysharing information about productive fishing or bait gatheringlocations. This information is shared and discussed during ice-teadrinking sessions (tereré). Within the communities there is noterritoriality and fishers from the same community can come andfish on the same lake that some else is already using. Therefore,between community members, there are no defined boundariesaround the resources that they use, as predicted in open propertyregimes (Moritz et al. 2018). We have previously argued that theopenness and reciprocity that occurs within the Barra do SãoLourenço community is the unpredictable availability of naturalresources in the region explained above, which forces people tofind cooperative ways to increase their chance of finding fish orbait (Chiaravalloti and Dyble 2019). However, neitherinformation nor fishing grounds are shared with people fromoutside Barra do São Lourenço (Chiaravalloti 2017a). Thecommunity has a clear territory that they will defend if  fishersfrom other communities trespass its limits. For example,ethnographic research has recorded several knife fights withpeople from other communities trying to fish within Barra do SãoLourenço territory (Chiaravalloti 2017a). Theoretical modelssuggested that limiting the sharing of information and territoryto community members results from a compromise between thebenefits of information sharing and the costs of competition(Chiaravalloti and Dyble 2019). Therefore, between communities,the system has features that are usually characteristic of acommon property regime (Ostrom 1990).Data collectionWe have been studying the Barra do São Lourenço communitysince 2013, and have conducted eight one-month field tripsbetween 2013 and 2014 as part of an ethnographic study by RC(Chiaravalloti 2019) and 10 two-week field trips as part of a long-term project focused on livelihood changes and persistencebetween 2015 and 2019. The project was approved by both afederal and a local ethics committee from the study region(acceptance number CAE 828,070).Spatial dataSpatial data were used to estimate water availability in 2019 for aperiod of the dry (7 March to 6 April) and flood seasons (6 Juneto 6 July) for a 3-km radius around the Barra do São Lourençocommunity. For each season we first estimated the total area ofwater using Sentinel 1 (radar, 5 meters resolution). These imagesare not blocked by any kind of vegetation or cloud, which allowsus to estimate the total quantity of water in the system regardlessof the presence of aquatic vegetation or gallery forest blockingthe visualization. Second, based on the data on “water,” we createda hybrid image combining both Sentinel 1 (radar) and Sentinel 2(optical, also 10 meters resolution). Sentinel 2 (optical) allows usto measure only the visible water in the system. In this case,Sentinel 2 does not capture water hidden by the aquaticvegetation. Therefore, a hybrid image of Sentinel 1 and 2 allowedus to measure the quantity of water that is not hidden under theaquatic vegetation, “open water.” Several processing tools wereused to produce these hybrid images, including the calibration ofa different Normalized Difference index (such as NormalizedDifference Water Index) based on photos of the area from thesame time, cloud and temporal filtering, and visual inspection.The classification was carried out through random forest basedon 100 random trees. We developed this method of floodclassification based on Xu (2006) and Huang and Jin (2020). Wealso created a map of water connectivity, which is the total surfacearea of water that was not covered by vegetation and that wasaccessible by boat from the main river, named here “accessibleopen water.” This was created through a morphological patternanalysis, based on a method developed by Soille and Vogt (2009).The final result was a raster showing water bodies connected tothe main river. This analysis was conducted in QGis 3.0, MSPAplugin (Vogt and Riitters 2017). The models were tested bycomparison with GPS data from the field to test for accuracy.Economic dataWe collected data on the livelihood strategies and fishing returnsof all community households using two methods: calendars andsemi-structured interviews. The calendars consisted of 30 dailysheets that included a map of the region and illustrations of thefish or bait that fishers in the community might catch. We providedone calendar to each of the 16 households during the dry season(7 March to 6 April) and another during the flood season (6 Juneto 6 July). We asked them to note their daily catch, to indicate ona map where they had gone fishing, and to mark whether theyhave not gone fishing for some reason, e.g., resting day, religionreasons, celebrations, etc. During the first week of the calendarwe visited each of the 16 households on at least two occasions tohelp them to fill out the calendar. Before we left the community,we asked all households to fill them out themselves every day afterthey returned from fishing. The same method was repeated in thedry and flood seasons. Similar citizen science techniques in theBarra do São Lourenço community have been used since 2013,and community members already have experience in helping tocollect scientific data (Chiaravalloti 2017a). We also interviewedall households both during the dry and flood season through thesemi-structured interviews. First, we aimed to double-check someof the information provided in the calendars, repeating some ofthe questions to check information reliability. Out of the 16households asked to fill out the calendars, eight returned them inboth seasons and with the answers considered reliable. We alsorecorded the type of fishing gear and bait used, fishing techniques,and other possible differences in fishing practices betweenseasons. We converted daily catch into a monetary value (inBrazilian Reais) based on the average price paid in the nearestcity for each species at that time (Catella et al. 2014).Social network dataPeople in the Barra do São Lourenço community frequently visiteach other to discuss productive fishing locations and rely on theinformation that they share. We sought to capture theseinteractions using a roster method in which adults from each ofthe 16 households were asked if  they had spoken about fishinggrounds to members of each other household within the last twoweeks. By using a list of all households as a prompt duringEcology and Society 26(2): 30https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art30/interviews, this method reduces the likelihood of recall errors(Butts 2008). This information was used to build social networks.In building these networks we only included dyads with mutualagreement, i.e., where A reported speaking with B and B reportedspeaking with A. To establish kinship between communitymembers, we conducted genealogical interviews with all adults inthe community and, from this, built a network of relatedness forall community members defined according to a measure (s) thattakes into account both affinal and consanguineal relatedness(Dyble et al. 2018). We looked at two measures of overall socialnetwork structure: average path length and transitivity. Averagepath length measures the mean number of ties between pairs ofindividuals across the whole network. Transitivity is a measure ofhow clustered interactions are. Statistical analyses wereperformed in R.3.3.3 (R Core Team 2018), and network analysisand visualization used functions from the igraph package (Csardiand Nepusz 2006). Permutation tests were conducted using acustom script with 10,000 permutations.RESULTSSeasonal ecosystem changesOur satellite imaging results demonstrate the marked seasonalchange in the ecology of the Pantanal associated with the annualflood pulse (Fig. 2). During the dry season the 3605 ha areaaround Barra do São Lourenço included a total of 1453 ha ofsurface water. Of this, 714 ha was open, i.e., not covered byvegetation, and 456 ha was both open and accessible to fishers.For the same area in the flood season, 1932 ha was surface waterof which 1029 ha was open and 977 ha was both open andaccessible. Thus, the amount of water available to fish during theflood season was more than double that of the dry season (453to 977 ha, a 214% increase). If  we exclude the large River Paraguayfrom these estimations and look only at the smaller channels andpools in which fish are most often found at high density, thedifference is even more pronounced, with 182 ha accessible in thedry season versus 703 ha accessible during the flood.Economic changesOur economic data show differences in catch composition, fishingtechniques, and space use between the dry and flood seasons. Inthe dry season, fishers reportedly focused their efforts on usingmultiple fishing rods fixed into the riverbank (anzol de galho) tocatch large migratory fish (mostly catfish), which are concentratedin the main channels migrating up the river during this period. Incontrast, in the flood season fishers changed their focus to shortmigratory fish (scaly fish), which are concentrated in smaller waterbodies during this period. Because there are no riverbanks to fixthe rods to during the flood, local people started to use fly fishing(batida) from their canoes or small boats (Fig. 3). These seasonaldifferences can be seen in our data (Fig. 3a), with catfishcontributing more to the total catch by monetary value in the dryseason (dry = 51.1%, flood = 20.1%) and scaly fish contributingmore in the flood season (dry = 10.8%, flood = 37.9%). Baitgathering was an important part of the total catch in both seasons(dry = 38.1%, flood = 41.9%).  Our data also show that fishers were more mobile during the flood,with fishing trips by the same people on consecutive days being~50% more likely to be made to different areas during the floodcompared with the dry season (dry: N = 80 fishing trips, 45.0%Fig. 2. Seasonal variation in accessible water for fishing in thePantanal. The first row refers to the images from the dry period(“water”: all water in the system; “open water”: all water that isnot covered by aquatic vegetation; and “accessible open water”:all water bodies that are not covered by aquatic vegetation andcan be accessed by boat from the main river. The second rowrefers to the images from the flood period, also showing thethree “water” types.Fig. 3. Seasonal changes in fishing practices and return rates.(a-b) Catch composition in the dry and flood season, dividedinto three main categories (from left to right): bait, catfish,scaly fish; (c) probability of fishers moving area from one dayto the next in each season; (d) daily fishing returns in eachseason.Ecology and Society 26(2): 30https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art30/fishers moved from one day to the next 95% CI = [39.4,50.56];flood: N = 116 fishing trips, 66.4% fishers moved from one dayto the next 95% CI = [62.0,70.8], proportions test X² = 8.01, p =0.005; Fig. 2b). During the dry season, the majority of fishingwas concentrated in two areas close to the home settlement, whilein the flood season fishing ranged across a broader area, withsome overnight trips into the northern part of the region, around50 km from home. The seasonal flexibility we see in how, where,and what the Pantaneiros fish allows them to maintain similarfishing return rates between seasons despite the ecologicaldifferences (dry season: N = 91 fishing trips, mean = R$201, SD= 168; flood: N = 142 fishing trips, mean = R$168, SD = 122;Fig. 3b).Social changesDespite the pronounced differences in fishing methods and spaceuse between seasons, the overall social network was very similaracross the two fishing periods (Fig. 4a-b). The overall proportionof households that had spoken to one another during the previoustwo weeks was ~50% in both fishing seasons (March: 118 of 240ties [49.1%], August: 122 of 240 ties [50.83%]) and the overallstructure of the network was also similar in both fishing seasons(March: average path length = 1.54, transitivity = 0.55; August:average path length = 1.49, transitivity = 0.58). However, thissimilarity occurred despite a large turnover in who peopleinteracted with. If  two households interacted in the dry season,there was a 59.3% chance they interacted in the flood season.Although a permutations test suggests that this is significantlymore consistent than expected by chance (expected = 50.9%, p =0.027), the magnitude of the effect is small, suggesting thatinteractions in August are only ~15% more likely to occur if  theyalso occurred in dry season than would be expected if  interactionswere random. In fact, the consistent ties in the network appear tobe largely among closely related households (related by s > 0.25,see Methods) such that when these closely related households areexcluded from the network the remaining interactions are no morelikely to be seen across seasons than by chance (observedconsistency = 39.7%, expected = 41.2%, two-tailed permutationtest p = 0.45). However, although households varied greatlybetween seasons in who they interacted with, there wasconsistency in the overall number of interactions they had, witha significant correlation in the number of interactions eachhousehold has across seasons (Pearson’s r = 0.67, 95% CI = [0.27,0.88], t = 3.40, p = 0.004). There was no association between socialties and a composite measure of household wealth (Pearson’s r =0.05, 95% CI = [-0.45, 0.54], t = 0.21, p = 0.84). Across the twoseasons, 67.8% of closely related households (s >= 0.25)interacted compared to 39.3% of distantly related or unrelatedhouseholds, proportions test: X² = 35.3, p < .001; Fig. 4b).  If  social interactions during periods of intense economic activityare in support of economic activities, then the off  season inNovember-December represents a useful point of comparison.During the off  season, individuals had interactions with membersof fewer households, with interactions having occurred between35% of households (84 of 240 ties). Even though the structure ofthe off-season network remained similar (average path length =1.59 transitivity = 0.58), there was no association between thenumber of interactions per household between the fishing seasonmonths and the off  season (dry season vs off-season: Pearson’s r= -0.06, 95% CI = [-0.54, 0.44], t = -0.22, p = 0.8; wet season vsoff-season: Pearson’s r = -0.18, 95% CI = [-0.62, 0.33], t = -0.18,p = 0.48).Fig. 4.

First, we provide a quantitative portrait of economicresilience in the face of marked seasonal change in the Pantanal.We demonstrate that between the dry and wet seasons in 2019,the total amount of water accessible for fishing more thandoubled, and almost quadrupled outside of the main riverchannel. The fishers in our study community dealt with thisecological change by altering their fishing techniques and targetspecies and being more mobile in the flood, which allowed themto maintain similar fishing return rates between seasons. This isan important aspect of resilience in small-scale societies thatconservation interventions tend to overlook (Song et al. 2018).Initiatives seeking sustainability of social-ecological systemsoften consider people as static agents in time and space (Wilson2017) and, for fisheries, commonly seek to introduce measuressuch as forbidding certain fishing gear or the collection of certainspecies or sizes of fish, or restricting areas of use through thecreation of strictly protected areas (Abbott and Campbell 2009).Such initiatives have been applied or suggested for the Barra doSão Lourenço community (Chiaravalloti 2019) and many otherfishery communities around the globe on several occasions inrecent decades (Cooke et al. 2016). Our results suggest that if  thefishers in our study community were restricted in their mobilityEcology and Society 26(2): 30https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art30/or prohibited in the range of fishing gear they were permitted touse, they would not be able to adapt to the annual flood pulse,which can vary greatly in magnitude between years (Hamilton etal. 1996, Alho and Sabino 2012). This finding can be extrapolatedto other seasonal ecosystems, like the Pantanal wetland, or regionsthat are currently facing more frequent environmental changes:limiting the ability of people to change their resource use strategiesmay hinder their resilience and may lead to poverty traps orcommunity collapse (Béné 2009, Song et al. 2018).  We also studied the social network structure of our studycommunity across fishing seasons and during the closed fishingseason. We found that although the overall structure ofinteractions between households was reasonably stable betweenfishing seasons, interactions were significantly less frequentduring the closed fishing season. We suggest that this is reflectiveof households relying less on one another for economic supportand information sharing in the closed season. The social networkanalysis also showed that while some households had consistentlymore interactions than others, the distribution of theseinteractions (with the exception of interactions between closelyrelated households) was relatively random and there was nocorrelation between the wealth and social connectedness ofhouseholds. These results are indicative of a generally equal andautonomous political structure, which increases the chance ofspreading the correct information about the location of fish orbait (Barnes et al. 2016). These social network results, combinedwith the economic and ecological data, provide a quantitativepicture of this social-ecological system in which information-sharing and reciprocity are critical in dealing with theunpredictability of fishing and bait gathering in the Pantanal.  Many conservation interventions seeking to promote or evaluategood governance of social-ecological systems tend to underpintheir approaches on common property regime (CPR) designprinciples (Ostrom 1990, Botto-Barrios and Saavedra-Díaz2020). In other words, they are centered around the idea thatclearly defined boundaries between people and the resources thatthey use play a pivotal role in communities’ resilience (Dietz et al.2003). This is indeed the case for many social-ecological systems.For instance, supported by the theory presented in Ostrom’sPrinciples for CPRs, managers in the Mamirauá SustainableDevelopment Reserve, Amazon floodplains, implemented anarapiauma (Arapaima gigas) fishing program (Castello et al.2009), which resulted in doubling increase of the arapaimapopulation size and increased fishery revenues by 400% (Campos-Silva and Peres 2016). However, in the Pantanal, the waycommunity members found to control conflicting interests(collective-choice dilemma) and achieve social resilience was byhaving no boundaries between a certain number of people, insteadof creating clear limits, named limited open access (Chiaravallotiand Dyble 2019). We argue that this may not only be seen in thePantanal wetland, but in many seasonal ecosystems facingconstant environmental changes, and other examples have alreadybeen presented in marine fisheries in Ecuador (Beitl 2015),swidden farming in Belize (Downey 2015), and pastoralists inEastern Africa (Homewood and Rodgers 1991). Therefore, inseasonal ecosystems facing constant changes, actions should befocused on celebrating information exchange rather thanimposing clear limits (Moritz et al. 2018).  It is important to emphasize that the flexibility in livelihoodstrategies and stability in social networks that we argue are animportant aspect of community resilience do not necessarily leadto ecological sustainability (Holt 2005). Both have to matchecosystem dynamics (Ostrom 1990). However, that said, theregion of the Barra do São Lourenço community has no sign ofoverfishing (Polaz et al. 2017). This is likely because of thevariability of the flood pulse alongside the presence of movingfloating vegetation that imposes natural barriers to fishers,making over 70% of the area inaccessible to fishing (Chiaravallotiand Dyble 2019). Similar ecological dynamics have been describedfor other social-ecological systems that present hybrid governancesystems, such as pastoralists in East Africa who see over two-thirds of the grassland in the region inaccessible (Scholte 2007,Homewood 2008). This allows regular refugia in which resourcescan increase populations in the absence of use, before beingreconnected (Noy-Meir 1975, Berryman and Hawkins 2006).However, environmental changes and habitat destruction maywell lead to major disruption of this social-ecological system. Forexample, climate change is predicted to drastically reduce theextent of the flood in the Pantanal (Thielen et al. 2020). Althoughour results show the ability of the community of Barra do SãoLourenço to adapt to ecological variation, it is not guaranteedthat customary strategies that are currently consistent withsustainability and resilience will continue to be effective in theface of these changes. Answers to these questions are necessarybecause they can support possible outside interventions that seekto protect both the well-being of local communities and ecosystemsustainability (Cooke et al. 2016).CONCLUSIONWe show seasonal differences in ecology, fishing practices, andsocial networks among fishers in the Brazilian Pantanal. We firstuse satellite data to quantify differences in the quantity of wateraccessible to fishers between the dry and flood seasons in 2019,finding that accessible open water increases around four-foldoutside of the main river channel. We show that while fishersadapt to this ecological change by changing their fishing strategiesand increasing their mobility during the flood, the seasonalchanges did not modify their networks of social interactions,which showed robustness in terms of information sharing andreciprocity. These results better clarify the internal dynamics ofwhat we have previously characterized as a system of limited openaccess and emphasize the importance of looking quantitativelyat multiple aspects of seasonal social-ecological change. We hopethat our case study of adaptations to seasonal change cancontribute to the building of a broader understanding of howcommunities adapt to social-ecological change and that thisunderstanding can help to generate policy initiatives that help toprotect thousands of local communities and ecosystems that theyhelp protect (Garnett et al. 2018).Responses to this article can be read online at: https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/responses.php/12433Ecology and Society 26(2): 30https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol26/iss2/art30/Acknowledgments:This study was part of the project “TIES - Trade-offs in Ecosystemsand Socio Networks” funded by British Academy [NMGR1180519].The authors are grateful to local people for their hospitality duringfield trips.Data Availability:All the dataset used in the paper, r script and images created toanalyze the data is available in Figshare at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11921253.v1, reference number 11921253.v1.LITERATURE CITEDAbbott, J., and L.
