This situation created devastating consequences for the local community. As the pandemic fades, it is anticipated that the local authorities will revive the festival to address the negative effects felt during the crisis and enhance the tourist experience to increase Takoradi's tourism potential.  The Ankos Festival is a cultural and creative event conceptually rooted in the concepts of Cultural Tourism, Creative Tourism, and the ability these types of tourism products have to produce socioeconomic benefits for the host communities and the tourism destinations where they occur. Thus, the primary goal of this dissertation is to study the case of the Ankos Masquerade Festival, a significant cultural event in Takoradi, Ghana, to assess its ability to function as a socioeconomic lever for the Takoradi community after the Covid-19 crisis.  A mixed method approach was used to address the research goals and study the demand and supply sides. A survey was conducted to explore the perceptions of the tourists participating in the Ankos Festival. To assess the stakeholder's perceptions, semi-structured interviews were conducted. In this sense, both quantitative and qualitative techniques were used. The study's results allowed tracing the visitor's profile to the Ankos Festival and understanding the perceptions of the demand for this event. The stakeholders' perceptions about the festival were also evaluated. The set of these data allowed the conclusion that cultural events, such as the Ankos Festival, are essential for the maintenance of local cultural traditions and the preservation of the local community identity. But they also strongly impact the image of the destination, the tourist experience and the involvement of participants, having the ability to provide socio-economic development for the destination.

Esta situação gerou consequências devastadoras para a comunidade local. Com o desagravamento da crise pandémica, prevê-se que as autoridades locais reanimem o festival como forma de colmatar os efeitos negativos sentidos durante a crise e de melhorar a experiência turística para aumentar o potencial turístico de Takoradi. O Festival de Ankos é um evento cultural e criativo que está conceptualmente enraizado nos conceitos de Turismo Cultural, Turismo Criativo, e na capacidade que estes tipos de eventos, com elevada participação turística, têm de produzir benefícios socioeconómicos para as comunidades de locais e para os destinos turísticos onde se realizam. Assim, o principal objectivo desta dissertação é estudar o caso do Festival de Ankos, um evento cultural significativo em Takoradi, Gana, a fim de avaliar a sua capacidade de funcionar como uma alavanca socioeconómica para a comunidade de Takoradi, após a crise de Covid-19. Foi utilizada uma abordagem metodológica mista para abordar os objectivos de investigação e estudar simultaneamente os lados da procura e da oferta. Para estudar as percepções dos turistas participantes no Festival de Ankos, foi realizado um inquérito. Para compreender as percepções dos stakeholders, foram realizadas entrevistas semi-estruturadas. Neste sentido, foram utilizadas técnicas quantitativas e qualitativas. Os resultados do estudo permitiram traçar o perfil do visitante do Festival de Ankos, bem como compreender as percepções da procura acerca deste evento. As percepções dos stakeholders sobre o festival também foram avaliadas e o conjunto destes dados permitiu concluir que eventos culturais, tais como o Festival de Ankos, são importantes para a manutenção das tradições culturais locais e para a preservação da identidade da comunidade local. Mas também têm fortes impactos na imagem do destino, na experiência turística e no envolvimento dos participantes, tendo a capacidade de proporcionar desenvolvimento socioeconómico para o destino.

Festivais, atracções turísticas e visita de turistas a muitos destinos ficaram impossibilitados através das restrições impostas à aviação comercial e aos viajantes. Com o desagravamento da situação pandémica, e após a reabertura destes destinos, há necessidade de reanimar o Festival de Anos, que se realiza anualmente, em Takoradi, no Gana. Durante o período da pandemia este importante evento para a região teve de ser cancelado e essa situação teve com sequências muito negativas em termos socioeconómicos para a comunidade local. Segundo o relatório dos serviços estatísticos do Gana em (2020), a comunidade e o país sofreram uma crise da pandemia, tendo-se agravado bastante a situação do desemprego na região. Sendo uma comunidade muito dependente da actividade turística, da agricultura e da pesca, os danos provocados pela pandemia ainda se observaram com mais intensidade do que noutras regiões com economias mais diversificadas. Deste modo, é importante encontrar formas de reduzir os impactos da pandilha e trilhar caminhos para a recuperação sócio-económica da comunidade de Sekondi-Takoradi. O Festival de Ankos é um evento cultural e criativo que está conceptualmente enraizado nos conceitos de Turismo Cultural, Turismo Criativo, e na capacidade que estes tipos de eventos, com elevada participação turística, têm de produzir benefícios socioeconómicos para as comunidades de locais e para os destinos turísticos onde se realizam. Assim, o principal objectivo desta dissertação é estudar o caso do Festival de Ankos, um evento cultural significativo em Takoradi, Gana, a fim de avaliar a sua capacidade de funcionar como uma alavanca socioeconómica para a comunidade de Takoradi, após a crise de Covid-19. De forma mais específica este estudo pretende alcançar três objectivos: identificar os impactos socioeconómicos do Festival de Mascarada de Ankos para a comunidade Takoradi do Gana; Compreender de que forma os impactos identificados induziram a recuperação socioeconómica da comunidade de Takoradi; Elaborar um conjunto de recomendações políticas para informar e apoiar a tomada de decisões das autoridades locais.  viii Para responder aos objectivos propostos foi elaborada uma revisão de literatura ancorada nonas noções de turismo cultural, turismo criativo, eventos e festivais culturais e criativos e nos benefícios socioeconómicos que geralmente resultam deste tipo de turismo. Além disso foi usada uma abordagem metodológica mista para responder aos objectivos de investigação e estudar, simultaneamente, os lados da oferta e da procura. Para estudar as percepções dos turistas participantes no Festival de Ankos, foi realizado um inquérito (101 respondentes). Para compreender as percepções dos stakeholders, foram realizadas entrevistas semi-estruturadas (5). Neste sentido, foram utilizadas técnicas quantitativas e qualitativas. Os resultados do estudo permitiram traçar o perfil do visitante do Festival de Ankos: equilibrado em termos de género, jovem e solteiro; que se desloca a Sekondi-Takoradi com a motivação específica de participar num evento cultural (91%); que fica hospedado em hotéis (83%); tem uma estadia média de 3,58 noites; gasta em média 3.229,66€ no total com a sua visita, sendo que destina 258,54€ a entretenimento, categoria na qual se insere o Festival de Ankos, correspondendo a 7,5% do orçamento total. O estudo permitiu ainda compreender as percepções dos turistas sobre o festival de Ankos, incluindo a sua elevada satisfação com o mesmo, bem como as percepções dos stakeholders sobre o festival, que foram avaliadas através da realização de cinco entrevistas semi-estruturadas.  As entrevistas aos stakeholders destacaram algumas das principais preocupações das entidades com actuação no destino e na organização do Festival de Ankos. Desde logo os elevados valores mobiliários, a falta de investidores e, mais importante ainda, a necessidade de construção de mais alojamento para se adequar à procura turística. Os resultados das entrevistas também apoiam os argumentos de alguns dos estudos feitos por alguns autores sobre o turismo cultural e o turismo criativo, uma vez que concluem que os turistas não visitam os destinos apenas pelas atrações culturais mas também pelos eventos que muitas vezes funcionam como âncora. Os entrevistas sublinham ainda a necessidade de uma boa infra-estrutura e segurança para promover e legitimar o festival e torna-lo mais atrativo para os turistas.  ix Outro importante argumento levantado é a questão da autenticidade e como o turismo cultural contribui para esse aspecto nos destinos. A maioria dos argumentos revela que vários factores como tradições, história, gastronomia, cultura, vestuário, idioma são fundamentais. A maioria dos inquiridos foi ao encontro destes argumentos e apontaram que a singularidade do turismo cultural é a comida, as pessoas, o vestuário, o idioma, as atrações culturais e a atmosfera do local.  O conjunto destes resultados permitiu concluir de maneira geral que eventos como o Festival de Ankos, são importantes para a manutenção das tradições culturais locais e para a preservação da identidade da comunidade local. Mas também têm fortes impactos na imagem do destino, na experiência turística e no envolvimento dos participantes, tendo a capacidade de proporcionar desenvolvimento socioeconómico para o destino.

INTRODUCTION The coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic left a devastating trail of negative impacts. As for many tourism destinations all over the World, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis caused an economic breakdown in this crucial sector in many countries. The accommodation subsector was severely affected, with many small businesses collapsing during this period or facing difficulties funding their operations. As a result, the unemployment rate worldwide increased, and many people lost livelihood means. In the three years after the global pandemic was declared, many countries are still grappling with the devastating impact of the sanitary crisis on many economic sectors, such as agriculture, food sector, tourism, and above all, the hospitality sector and the aviation sector (Gossling et al., 2020). Previous to the pandemic crisis, tourism was the fastest-growing industry. Jamal and Budke (2020: 4) advocate that “in this current situation goods and services movement, threats and challenges have increased alongside the easiness of travel “swifts” movement of goods, knowledge, finaces and diseases”.  Nevertheless, in the current context, recovering from the Covid-19 crisis has become a new challenge to the tourism industry worldwide. China, for instance, has experienced the slowest growth on record, with a total of USD 2.7 trillion in lost output, equal to the whole GDP of the UK (Orlik et al., 2020). According to the World Travel and Tourism Council report (WTTC, 2020), about 75 million workers had an immediate risk of job loss due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The same report revealed that the tourism GDP in the world had a loss of US$ 2.1 trillion and a daily loss of one million jobs in the travel sector for the widespread impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The socioeconomic impacts of the covid- 19 crisis affected the tourism and hospitality industry. Some examples clearly show it. For instance, one of the biggest hotel chains, Marriott International, places tens of thousands of employees on Furlough (Marriot Furloug, 2020). Hilton Hotel group was forced to borrow additional loans from their bankers to recover their hardship situation of about $1.75bn to maintain stability in the markets during the Covid-19 (Hotel chain manoeuvre, 2020). The announcement of MGM Resorts International also made temporary suspensions in operation at its Las Vegas properties (MGM Resorts Statements, 2020). “In Europe, the 15  European Tourism Manifesto alliance, encompassing over 50 European public and private organisations from the travel and tourism sector, have highlighted the need to implement urgent measures. These include temporary state aid for the tourism and travel sector from the national government as well as fast and easy access to short-and medium-term loans to overcome liquidity shortage, including funds made available by the EU through the Corona Response Investment Initiative and fiscal relief” (Europe Tourism Sector, 2020: 2) Internationally, Vietnam received approximately 1.45 million Chinese visitors in the first quarter of 2019, dropping by 644,000 in January 2020. Vietnam's tourist sector is estimated to suffer a $5bn loss should the Covid-19 pandemic extend into the second quarter of 2020 (Vietnam Times, March 2020). Regarding the tourism sector, the most popular African tourism destinations such as Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia were closed to tourists during the pandemic, reducing the socioeconomic benefits such as taxes and employment (Baum and Ndivim, 2020). Africa is one of the continents facing more complex challenges in recovering from the pandemic due to its high disease burden, poor health infrastructure, and poor social systems necessary for combating the pandemic (Ataguba, 2020). “Africa faces particular challenges in this regard, not least about revenue losses impacting communication in or near conservation-critical areas” (Fletcher et al., 2020: 2). In Ghana, one of the most significant initiatives made by the Ministry of Tourism since 1992 focused on attracting foreign tourists more than locals. As a result, through this initiative, several events took place, such as the “Pan African Historical Theatre Festival, known as the “Panafest”, the “Year of Return”, and “Beyond the Return”, focusing on attracting tourists from all over the world, especially from the diaspora, to experience Ghana’s culture and also to promote Ghanaian tourist sites (Ghana Tourism Authority, 2019). “Consequently, most eco-tourist sites in Ghana are patronised mostly by non-Ghanaian. With the onset of the covid-19 pandemic, eco-tourism in Ghana has thus suffered a downward turn due to its over-reliance on foreign tourist. This is because of the suspension of air travel, lockdowns and social distancing protocols instituted in many countries worldwide. Indeed, all national parks, 16  most tourist sites and hospital industries in Ghana were closed down either following governments directives or through the initiatives of the managers of facilities” (Soliku et al 2021: 5). Another creative festival in Ghana which had a total cancellation due to the Covid-19 pandemic is the Ankos Masquerade Festival, which takes place annually in Takoradi. It was cancelled during the pandemic years because of imposed travelling restrictions, having accentuated the adverse effects already being felt by the local communities. As the pandemic is fading, the community authorities are expected to bring back the festival to face the negative impacts felt during the crisis and improve the destination image by enhancing the touristic experience to increase Takoradi's touristic potential. Taking all these facts into consideration, the main objective of this dissertation is to study the case of the Ankos Masquerade Festival, an important cultural event of Takoradi, to assess its potential to work as socioeconomic leverage to the Takoradi community of Ghana after the Covid-19 crisis. Specifically, this research intends to:  ▪ Identify the socioeconomic impacts of the Ankos Masquerade Festival on the Takoradi community of Ghana; ▪ Understand in what ways the identified impacts induced the socioeconomic recovery of the Takoradi community; ▪ Elaborate policy recommendations to inform and support the local authorities' decision-making. This project research explains how a cultural event such as the Ankos masquerade festival brings awareness and community development in terms of infrastructures and equipment (for instance, improvement of the existing accessibilities) but also terms of living conditions (by providing more and better employment opportunities, for example) after the crisis faced in this western region of Ghana. According to Woodside (2011: 785), culture is “the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society”. Schuster and Copeland (2008: 17-20) examined that “culture is a 17  total way of life held in common way by a group of people. Learned similarities in language, speech, behaviours, ideology, livelihood, technology, value system, and society bind people together in a culture”. Cultural events, such as the Ankos Masquerade Festival, are essential to maintaining the local cultural traditions and preserving the local community's identity and collective memory (Olick, 1999). But they also strongly impact the perceived destination image, the tourism experience, and the participant's engagement, having the capacity to provide socioeconomic development for the territorial area. Thus, the impact evaluation is fundamental to identify, monitor, and evaluate tourism initiatives' various tangible and intangible effects and increase knowledge about them to create rewarding and sustainable experiences for tourists, residents, and project organisers. Identifying positive and negative repercussions allows local organisers to take preventive or corrective measures and build innovative solutions that improve the competitiveness of an initiative or, more broadly, the destination, making it more viable and attractive (Gato, et al., 2021). This dissertation is structured in five chapters, the introduction the first. The second chapter comprises the literature review, intending to frame the research topics addressed in the study and to understand the main concepts and notions surrounding cultural tourism, creative tourism and creative events, such as the Ankos Masquerade Festival study. The third chapter addresses the methodology where the research problem and goals, the research plan, the conceptual framework, the data collection and treatment are presented. In the fourth chapter, the case study results are discussed based on two empirical components to study the supply and demand sides: the survey of the tourists attending the Ankos Masquerade Festival (demand) and the interviews with the local stakeholders (supply). The document finalises chapter five, concluding with the research's main findings, limitations and future directions, and policy implications/recommendations.  18  Chapter 2. LITERATURE REVIEW This chapter will review the literature on cultural and creative tourism, particularly the creative events to frame the Ankos Masquerade Festival case under study.  (Origin of culture tourism, concept, evolution), Main goals that play socioeconomic impacts resulting from it and how it benefits local communities, and profile of participants in creative tourism, Culture and creative events perspectives. 2.1. Cultural Tourism  Research done by several authors in the past decades has highlighted the importance and link between creative tourism and cultural tourism. In their investigations, Richards and Wilson (2006) and William (2010) noted that the development of creative tourism is linked because of the recent development of cultural tourism. Cultural tourism is a type of tourism that has been growing in popularity in recent years. This is because countries are interested in getting a piece of the emerging world tourism market (Kohler and Durand, 2007), Included in the “leisure and recreation” segment (Boniface, Cooper and Cooper, 2020). The main reason why people visit cultural tourism events is because of the attraction of the place (Richards and Wilson, 2006; William 2010). It also allows visitors to learn and understand the destination's culture (Kajzar, 2013, 2014; Richards, 2014b).  According to Perrottel (2002), cultural tourism emerged with the Grand Tour advent since ancient Romans started travelling to visit Greece and Egypt. Cultural tourism was implicit in this form of travelling, allowing visitors to learn about a different culture. Cros and Mckercher (2020) underlined that cultural tourism refers to visiting places significant to someone's culture. This differs from traditional tourist destinations, which people visit for vacation or to see natural wonders. Cultural tourism is seen as an essential part of a traveller’s experience, and it can include things like visiting cultural landmarks, special events, and festivals. The International Council on Monument and Sites, a Charter for the interpretation and presentation of cultural heritage sites in Paris, in their 2008 meeting, argued that cultural 19  tourism is a term that means different things to different people, which has its strength and weakness. According to Smiths (2003), some people think that culture is something people learn from their families or experiences.  Over time, the definition of cultural tourism has been discussed in literature based on the need for more consensus around it. Some of these definitions include it within a broader tourism and management theory context (Zeppell and Hall, 1991). Some people go to different places to see interesting things. These people are called "special interest tourists." They visit museums, zoos, and other sites to see something interesting (Zeppell 1992; Ap 1999). The United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO), their article 7, paragraph 2, 22nd session of year 2017 number 1, 11 September 2017, define cultural tourism as a type of tourism activity in which the visitor's essential motivation is to learn, discover, experience and consume the tangible and intangible cultural attractions/products in a tourism destination. Some researchers think cultural tourists are more motivated to travel than other tourists. This may be because they believe these tourists have different travel reasons. The UNWTO (2006a), the Canadian Tourism Commission (date), Whyte, Hood and Whyte (2012) describe cultural tourism as the movement of people travelling to a place to learn about its cultural heritage and as a big motivator for many people to travel. Some authors believe motivation is the only thing that matters regarding cultural tourism. They believe travellers must have a meaningful experience with their place's culture, heritage, and unique character to be a proper tourist (Black Well, 1997; Schweitzer, 1999). The US National Endowment for the Arts, for example, defines it as “travel directed toward experiencing the arts, heritage, and special character of a place” (Whyte, Hood and White, 2012: 8). Almost all definitions are circular because they include a description and an example to illustrate it with that of the UNWTO, which states that Cultural tourism is when people move around for exciting things. After all, they are interested in the culture of a place. For example, someone might go on a study tour to learn about a particular place's history or take part in a performance or festival in that culture. Or someone might travel to visit sites and monuments related to that culture.  20  There are some excellent reasons to use different definitions of "cultural tourism", but each has limitations. A tourism-related definition identifies cultural tourism as a type of tourism, making it easier to think about and discuss. But these definitions are too generic to be useful in practice. Motivational and experience-based definitions recognise that people have different reasons for travelling and, thus, different experiences they want while visiting a place. This definition is more robust, but it can be challenging to determine what products these definitions could produce. An operational definition resolves the product dilemma and points out that many cultural tourism products are places of cultural significance used by locals (Cross and McKercher, 2020).  The different definitions of cultural tourism can be divided into two groups (Cross and McKercher, 2020). The first group assumes that anyone who visits a place or has an experience that may or may not reflect the destination's culture must be a "deep cultural tourist", according to the definition. However, this definition needs to be more complex because it overlooks why people visit places. The second group of definitions is more valuable because it recognises that people visit sites for different reasons (Cross and McKercher 2020), like its culture, history, traditions and community customs (Petkova, 2017). Petkova (2017) further describes that cognitive aspects push people who witness cultural tourism because they visit cultural tourism events to get to know the culture and feel the way the local community live. Cultural tourism existed long ago, but mass cultural tourism has been a new phase in recent decades (Petkova, 2017). Interestingly, cultural tourism enables many people to travel both domestically and internationally. Despite the widespread use of festivals to develop cultural tourism, however, there is continuing debate about the ability of festivals to attract tourists, mainly from abroad (McKercher et al., 2006). Prentice and Andersen (2003) pointed out that only a minority of festival attendees are tourists. In some locations, however, tourists can constitute a vital audience segment, with festivals offering visitors a window into local cultures (Richards, 2007). Cultural tourism is a type of tourism that is focused on visiting different cultures. The challenge is to define it in a helpful way for destination management organisations, which can use it to market the area and identify potential products. Most importantly, it can help 21  remember management actions that are appropriate for the needs of all stakeholders (Cross and McKercher, 2020). This has made so many destinations very interesting, increasing the cultural heritage, beliefs, and how people live there. In other words, it has also increased the socio-economic importance of these places because tourists and nationals purchase products such as food, clothes, artefacts, souvenirs, transport, and accommodation, among others. Richards (2018) investigated that cultural tourism accounts for international travel spending, over 39% of tourism arrivals. The author further expresses that very often known values and special intentions of a particular group of people which find expressional in certain customs, traditions, rituals, events building, monuments and artefacts attract people to unique destinations. This is also why the UNWTO (2017) attributed such beauty built upon the society's spiritual beliefs and emotional features, which cover traditional beliefs, values system, the lifestyle of people, creative industries and living culture, music, literature, historical heritage and architecture. Contemporary researchers highlighted that cultural tourism is the artistic and cultural manifestation of arts and drama outside their usual place of residence (Okumus et al., 2012).  2.1.1. Consumption and Experience of Cultural Tourism Tourism is when people go on trips to buy things and enjoy experiences (Richards, 1996; Urry, 2001). “Cultural tourism is the same as regular tourism, but with a few important differences. For cultural tourists, "consumption" means experiencing attractions at a wide variety of levels. But "consumption" can also have a connotation of risk, meaning that some tourists want only a superficial experience and others want a deeper experience. To make it easier for cultural tourists to have this type of consumption, heritage assets (like buildings or art) are often turned into products (like souvenirs or photographs). “This transformation process can have a risk of destroying the asset if it's not managed carefully” (Cross and McKercher, 2020: 20). 22  Event experience research reflects the complexity of the phenomena being studied, with a wide range of approaches, often with little common ground between them (Richards, 2019). Following several appeals to advance research with innovative methods to understand the visitor experience (Dixon et al., 2011; Holloway et al., 2010; Jaimangal-Jones, 2014; Mair and Whitford, 2013), quantitative research has continued to evolve, and more qualitative research has begun to emerge in the field of event management. Pine and Gilmore (1997) express that in terms of experience, the organisation uses services as a step “, and goods as props to engage individual customers in a way that creates a memorable event. Commodities are fungible, goods tangible, services intangible, and experiences memorable” (Pine and Gilmore 1997: 25, 10-18) They also explain that “while prior economic offerings commodities, goods, and services are external to the buyer, experiences are inherently personal, existing only in the mind of an individual who has been engaged on an emotional, physical, intellectual, or even spiritual level”. These researchers, moreover, conceptualised experience by reflecting on internal responses resulting from emotional, physical, intellectual, and spiritual levels of consumer engagement.  Getz, (2007) also advocates the “uses of the experience concept in terms of cognition, consciousness, affect, feelings, knowledge, and skills as well as different meanings of the verb “to experience” by describing happenings, emotions, feelings, and change” (Getz, 2007: 103-22) The author analyses cognitive as a component expressing peoples understanding, memory, evaluation about the experience while affective components describe person own different meaning when approaching another thing. Schmitt (1999) also highlighted five Strategies Experience Modules (SEMs), which include 1. sense, which creates experience through sound, sight, touch, smell, and taste; 2) feel, or creating affective experiences including joy and pride; 3) think, which involves cognitive experiences; 4) act, by showing customers different ways of doing things; and 5) relate, which goes beyond individual feelings and fulfils a desire for self-improvement.    23  2.1.2 Destination Image According to Trang et al. (2023), destination image is a crucial determinant of tourists’ destination choice and loyalty formation; despite works suggesting the multi-sensory image as an additional dimension of destination image alongside the cognitive, affective, and conative images, there has been little quantitative evidence validating the view. Chen et al. (2019) also denoted the creation of lively, convivial festival scopes that enhances place appeal by bringing residents and non-locals together. Thus, the destination promotes the relationship between the event and the visitors. Moreover, destination images are often described and made available in every place as a means of promotion. Therefore, tourists perceive destination images based on their trips or visits to a specific country, region, province, state, or city (Mossberg and Kleppe, 2005). In short, the destination image is “people’s perceptions of a destination” (Lee and Xue, 2020: 394). Once more, extensive tourism literature provided the destination image according to the representation of the destination image model and the cognitive and affective components to explain the travel behaviour (Chen et al., 2016; De Nisco et al., 2015). The image of a destination determines the visit of people.   2.1.3 Economic Dimension of Cultural Tourism Most arguments highlighted when it comes to the economic benefits of cultural tourism in the case of Richards (2001), culture tourism has long had a significant economic dimension, mainly the income derived from it is a motivator factor helping to support the preservation of cultural heritage. In many cases, however, debates have also emerged about how income streams derived from cultural tourism have reached the cultural amenities that help to attract tourists (Richards, 2001; Russo, 2002). Martínez and Fernandez-Morales (2015) pinpoint the role of cultural tourism in reducing seasonality in Andalucía. In Italy, Guccio et al. (2018) analysed the impact of the monetary value of cultural heritage on tourism. They also highlighted that a million euros worth of cultural heritage generates about 1000 more cultural 24  visitors, which underlines the strong relationship between the regional performance of the tourism sector and cultural visitors.   2.2. Creative Tourism The experience economy has led to changes in many sectors, including tourism (Pine and Gilmore, 1998, 1999). Traditional cultural tourism needs to find a new way to cater to the desires of tourists seeking more meaningful and niche experiences. Creative tourism has arisen in this context, simultaneously with the increase of the academic debate around the creative economy (Howkins, 2001), creative cities (Landry, 2000), and creative industries (Caves, 2002), which strongly influenced the political discourse and public policies since the beginning of ’00s.  Creative tourism is an emergent and niche tourism product that focuses on experiences that are more meaningful and interactive than traditional cultural tourism, where tourists assume a more passive role as visitors. This type of tourism is growing because more and more people are looking for new ways to travel and learn new things rather than just visiting famous places (Richards, 2000; Richards and Raymond, 2000).  “It is a niche tourism area that emerged both as a development of cultural tourism and in opposition to the emergence of mass cultural tourism; its activities commonly incorporate four dimensions: active participation, creative self-expression, learning, and community engagement” (Bakes, Duxbury and Castro, 2018 p.2-18) Creative tourism responds to motivations where travellers seeking meaningful and transformative experiences are actively satisfied with their motives. Some research on creative tourism has been done by academics who study the topic, and others have been developed through practitioners who offer their observations. There is much academic research that has been done to help to understand creative tourism.  There is a lack of research that uses a holistic, integrated approach to help solve this gap. However, this isn't always accurate, so new research is being done to determine the co-25  creation of creative experiences’ and ‘the business models adopted by creative tourism entrepreneurs (Duxbury and Richards, 2019b: 184). One of the biggest challenges in dealing with practice-based issues is that we don't have many examples of how to do it successfully (Bakes, Duxbury and Castro, 2018). Richards (2016, 2018) stresses that the first creative tourism program initiated in 2003 in New Zealand motivated different parts of the world to invest in this type of tourism activity. “Multiple destinations and experiences that would be gathered in an international organism formed in 2010 (Creative Tourism Network) for the creative tourism development worldwide. In Portugal, creative tourism offers are taking their first steps as labelled products, either on the production or demand side. As a research and incubation project, CREATOUR has made a significant contribution to frame and strengthen creative tourism experiences throughout the peripheral areas of the country and fostering a national network that can connect to the international network of creative tourism in the near future” (Gato et al., 2020: 225-238) Richards and Duxbury (2021) point out that the major difference that separates creative tourism from cultural tourism is that in creative tourism, tourists seek to expand their knowledge of the place of visit and their creative skills. Furthermore, these authors express that in many creative experiences, there are also tangible end products which tourists receive: for instance, photos, food, crafts, and clothes, among others. “Creative learning and making experience can help individuals tap into and realise their latent creative abilities, thus provide a direct link between the destination culture and tourist, and give something to take home as” “I-made-it-myself souvenir” Richards and Duxbury, 2021: 189-206). OECD (2014) also analyses that creative approaches to tourism offer the potential to add more meaning by seeking attention to creative content and experience, supporting innovation and helping to make places more distinctive and attractive. OECD (2014) notes that creative industries are knowledge-based creative activities that link producers, consumers and businesses by utilising technology, talent or skill to generate meaningful intangible cultural products, creative content and experiences. They comprise many sectors: advertising, animation, architecture, design, film, gaming, gastronomy, music, performing arts, software and interactive games, and television and radio.  26  Many researchers also argued that the relationship between tourism and the creative economy, covering the development of creative economy policies, specific creative sectors and activities, the role of knowledge and networks in tourism and the growth of specific ‘creative tourism’ experiences (Fahmi, McCann, and Koster, 2017; Fernandes, 2011; Gretzel and Jamal, 2009; Richards, 2011; Stolarick, Denstedt, Donald, and Spencer, 2011; Wattanacharoensil and Schuckert, 2016).  The convergence of tourism and the creative economy has, in many areas, occurred naturally through the growth of the creative industries, creative clusters and the creative class (Gretzel and Jamal, 2009). Destinations try to attract the mobile ‘creative class (Florida, 2002) as a new breed of cultural tourist interested in the creative atmosphere and ‘buzz’ of places. Such locations are increasingly identified and packaged as ‘creative clusters’ of which there are growing numbers worldwide (Marques and Richards, 2014). Many of these formally designated clusters are now major tourist destinations in different countries (Booyens and Rogerson, 2015; Richards, 2014), and there are also growing numbers of visitors to informal creative areas in cities such as London (Pappalepore, Maitland, and Smith, 2014).  Creative tourism has been defined as “tourism which offers tourists the opportunity to develop their creative potential through active participation in courses and learning experiences which are characteristic of the destination where they are undertaken” (Richards and Raymond, 2000: 18). Thus, creative tourism helps tourists learn about the local culture and history. UNESCO (2006: 3) define creative tourism as “travel directed toward an engaged and authentic experience, with participative learning in the arts, heritage, or special character of a place, and it provides a connection with those who reside in this place and create this living culture”. Prentice and Anderson, (2007) and Richards and Wilson (2006: 1-10) add that “Creativity resources are more sustainable than tangible culture product because creative tourism utilises resources that are processed in essence, emphasising the experience based upon the natural and cultural resources and is this by definition is more sustainable than traditional culture tourism based on the consumption of built environments”.  27  Nowadays, the word creativity is coined tourism in many ways, such as developing tourism products and experiences. This has led to the redevelopment of new products and promoted the use of creative techniques to improve the tourism experience, adding more value (Richards, in press).  2.2.1. Creative Tourism Dimensions Creative tourism is one of the forms of evolution of cultural tourism, being also essential to introduce a new competitive advantage strategy and innovation in tourism activities as denoted by some authors (Richards and Raymond, 2000). The ways people travel are constantly changing, which impacts cultural tourism (Richards, 2014).  The understanding of creative tourism, and particularly in what refers to the creative tourism experiences offered to the tourists, involves four dimensions: (i) active participation of tourists in the activities they engage in, (ii) the possibility for tourists to learn, (iii) promote a creative self-expression and (iv) favour the immersion in the culture and local community of the visited destination (Duxbury and Silva, 2020). These ideas underline the need for creative ideas for tourists and for active engagement and dynamic experience in which visitors can learn about “destinations characteristics and traditions, and this paves the way for creative tourism” (Richards, 2014). For this reason, creative tourism has developed to portray the unique “experience-based” on the visitor’s knowledge and building useful information concerning the creativity of arts, heritage, or special features of the tourist destinations (Richards, 2011; Bruin, 2016).  Another critical aspect of creative tourism is its natural link to cultural tourism. The aspect of global markets of culture tourism been congested brought the newly developed creativity of tourism, the involvement of tourist experience and activities, engagement of stakeholders, products and services replaced,” hence cities and regions (Richards and Wilson, 2006; Stipanovic and Ruden, 2015) are choosing creative and sustainable strategies.  28  The definition of creative tourism by the OECD pinpoints the goal of creativity and tourism. According to them, “Creative tourism has evolved into a creative and Knowledgeable environment in which managers, visitors and destinations use technology, Know-how, and expertise to produce attractive creativity experiences” (OECD, 2014); according to Richards, G (2020), This form of creative tourism has increased into taking part into an experience that its results are excellent informal learning conditions.  2.2.2. Socioeconomic Impacts of Creative Tourism Several researchers have highlighted the social and economic impact of creative tourism. Wisansing and Vongvistsin (2019:122) stress that “from a macro and top-down imposition of what well-being, sustainability, and quality of life should look like for communities, to a bottom-up approach that emphasises democratic participation and empowerment in the development of locally significant understandings of the community's well-being and its measurement”. They also examine that creative tourism not only provides experience but builds the image of rural development through increased diversity (50% of team leaders are women); retaining the younger generation in the villages with new business opportunities; sourcing from local producers, creating backward economic linkages, stimulating agriculture and local food production; and gastronomic trails incorporating local food foraging, cooking classes, and ancillary services, reducing economic leakages. Richards, Wisansing, and Paschinger (2019) pointed out that the “design principles of creative tourism experience were further elaborated in creating a tourism toolkit”. These authors underline that user experience design is crucial to enable local communities to expand their tourism offerings. It outlines an experience design model based on content development, conceptualisation and enrichment. Content development stimulates local communities to use artistic and storytelling skills to develop engaging and participative experiences. These encourage residents to think about their own culture and assets, also considering the view of the outsider and favour its valorisation by the local communities. The conceptualisation of the experience includes engaging the five senses in the development process and providing spaces and a flow of activities to allow for creative expression.  29  The experience can then be enriched through the co-creation and innovation of new experiences between tourists and locals. Richards (2019) researched that creative tourism can be a beneficial strategy for small places because it is based on personal interaction, one-to-one contact between tourists and locals and depth of place experience. “Smaller cities lack the critical mass of creative producers to support significant economic activity and social networks” (Lorentzen and Van Heur 2012: 5-10) In the case of the Netherlands, a small city has utilised creativity to market itself worldwide (Richards and Duif 2018). Lorentzen (2012: 10-15) pinpoints “similar principles in her analysis of tourism development strategies for small Danish cities. For example, in the small northern city of Frederikshavn, hit by the closure of its shipyards, experience development through events and creative programmes produced significant growth in tourism”. The mayor's vision was critical in supporting this approach and sustaining the development programme over a long period. An important principle was collaboration rather than competition: “Taking unconventional approaches leads to creating something special. When we work together, across all kinds of boundaries, we can achieve things that we could never accomplish alone.” (Freire-Gibb and Lorentzen, 2011: 165).  Some large cities have adopted a model called the "creative city" (Landry, 2000), where people come together to create new things (Florida, 2002). People worldwide try to develop similar strategies for the same global designations, such as the “UNESCO Creative City title” (Marques, 2019).  In Germany, the Urbanana project was initiated with the contribution of the European Union in 2017. This project was created to support “destination for the urban lifestyle and scene” The programme uses music, fashion, and literature to create a more desirable image for this former industrial region, to attract creatives and to build its creative capacity, “Together with the creative community, we come up with a network of ideas for your bucket list” (Nordrhein-Westfalen Tourism, 2019).  30  2.2.3. Creative Tourists Profile and Perceptions Several authors have researched the creative tourist’s profile around the world. The table below summarises the central studies dedicated to identifying the profile of international creative tourists. Researchers in Portugal developed a study concerning the profile of creative tourism visitors. In the study in “Guimaraes”, it was identified that “the majority of the respondents had not heard about creative tourism before (82% in total; n = 115). The authors reported that 50.7% were male and between 38 and 49 years old and highlighted that 80% of the tourists came from the following countries: 35.7% from Brazil, 18.8% from Spain and 12.5% from France”. Most respondents had higher education degrees and an income higher than 501 euros/month (Melo et al. 2019). According to Florida, (2002 p 65-70),” the group belong to creative tourism tend to stage in a creative class, this so-called class have high improvement in education as well as from middle level to the upper layers in the society”. The table below shows the international creative tourism profile adopted from Remoaldo et al. (2020 p.10(2),1-12) creative tourism profile list.  Table 1. Tourists profile of international creative tourism Year Author Country Creative Tourist Profile 2019 Huang Chang and Backman Taiwan By age, the largest number of the tourist was between 31 and 40 years of age. Males comprised 40.8% and the females made up 59.2%. The survey was carried out in three popular creative tourism attraction in Taiwan. Creative activity, poetry, handcrafts and arts making.  2015 Blapp  Indonesia Most tourist find it memorable to attend a cooking class, ride cow, take part in the daily lives of the population of Bali and visit rice plantation 2014 Backman and Hung Taiwan the largest number of tourists was between 31 and 40 years of age. Males comprised 40.8% and Females made up 59.2%. 2014 Tan et al.           Taiwan Most tourists were between 31 and 40 years of age (60%). Males comprised 46% and females 54%. Most of the tourists were Malaysian (72%) And 28% foreigners. The survey was conducted with Guest of 6 selected resorts hotels in Malaysian states Of Terengganu and 31  Kedah. Creative activities: cooking Classes, handicraft classes, storytelling sessions of local Tales and ‘batik painting.                     2010 Campbell  UK   Predominately female, 45 or more years of age. The other larger group was made up of younger women Aged between 22 and 30 years of age with busy full-time Jobs and no children. 2003 Raymond New Zealand     Three groups: baby-boomers and retired, tourist under 30 (E.g., students and backpackers visiting New Zealand) And New Zealanders of all ages. Sources: Remoaldo et al (2020: 10)  Raymond (2003) highlights in the case study of New Zealanders (in Table 2.2.4) that the segment and creative tourists' profile find their way more in general demographic profiles. In this sense, the author proposes a typology based on three demographic categories: the baby boomers and retired, tourists under 30, including students and backpackers and New Zealanders interested in learning more about different aspects of the country's culture. In a subsequent study, Raymond (2009) surveyed tourists from two creative tourism areas in the UK. The results showed that the participants were mainly females, at the age of 45 or more. Another study about creative tourist profiling was conducted by Tan et al. (2004). The authors propose five different categories of tourists based on the skills they demand from the experience they engage in: knowledge and learners’ skills, novelty-seekers, members aware of travel partners' growth, the ones interested in green issues, and the relaxed and leisurely type including statements about creativity and experience.  Bali (2015), there was incoming attempts to create a profile of creative tourist in Indonesia, which was done to indicate the creative experience of the rural community and was proposed by Blapp (2015). Formally 15 groups were interviewed, in the result 10 of the people interviewed indicated the creative experience of the rural community. This was based on an opportunistic strategy. Only Western tourists participated in this interview; this research focused on creative tourism geared toward the market of the West. (Blapp, 2015) Ali et al. (2016) investigated how tourism creativity experiences affect memories and people's intentions about satisfaction and behaviour. The number surveyed was about 296, 32  with guests from six selected resort hotels in Malaysia (Terengganu and Kedah states). The creative participants attended experiences such as cooking classes, handicrafts classes, storytelling of local tales and “batik painting”. The majority of the tourist was aged between 31 and 40, which rated percentage of (60%), mainly females (54%) from Malaysia (72%), and one-quarter being national from overseas (28%).  Hung et al. (2019) conducted creative tourism attraction experience research in Taiwan, using different creative experiences: pottery, handicrafts and arts-making development. Most of the 395 investigated tourists were aged between 31 and 40 years old, and the females recorded the highest proportion (59.2%).  Further studies were conducted in Portugal by Remoaldo et al. (2020, p 12-24) to check the creative tourism industry in Portugal; this was done in Porto.  The sample collected was more males representing a profile total of 385. The partaking influenced their motivations for creative tourism activities. The countries listed are Spain, with an age level of 19 and 25 years. They portray high academic degrees (Masters's and Bachelor's), and their income level was between (€15000 to 22,499) respectively; in the case of their motivations, 65% was recorded, and because they visit Porto makes them happy. In the case of friends and relatives, 18% saw, and 5% were able to visit cultural events or attractions. Regarding those attending creative activities, 47% responded with positive feedback. In conclusion, creative tourism increases people's experience, as seen in the various researcher’s attribution. When people travel, they learn and pick some experiences of the place. It is also seen that creative tourism promotes how we think about specific countries and increase the knowledge of particular locations.  2.3. Cultural and Creative Events and Festivals Mura and Kljucnikov (2008, p.11) highlighted that in cultural tourism, events could easily complement small business products in rural tourism agritourism. The account of cultural events in the total tourism market in the world constitutes 1/5 (Boucher et al., 2018). 33  The organisation of cultural events denotes various social, economic and environmental benefits for the tourism destinations and their host communities (Boucher et al., 2018). Tourists are interested in participating in cultural events or festivals, local celebrations, architecture, rituals and other related activities at their destinations (Hemandez-Mogollon et al., 2018; Christou et al., 2018).  Some aspects of the cultural events may consist of rituals, performances, ceremonials, festivals, and celebrations to showcase the sociocultural habits and traditions of the local communities (Oklobdzija, 2015). This kind of event benefits not only the tourists, as consumers, but also the tourism destinations, as they are important means to differentiate their uniqueness and promote a positive image building: “The atmosphere and uniqueness of cultural events arise from the places where events are organised. These factors can be used as appropriate marketing tools to differentiate the destination from other sites and build its image (Hernandez-Mogollon et al. 2018: 170-178). Cultural events and festivals are great learning opportunities for visitors, helping them to develop their cultural knowledge of the place and improve their psychological points of view. (Hernandez-Mogollon et al., 2018). “Cultural events are considered tourist attractions.” (Christou et al., 2018: 225-269). “The number of different cultural events and festivals has increased significantly in recent years.” (Baez Montenegro and Devesa- Fernandez, 2017: 173-195) Cultural events and various festivals have thus become an important factor in tourism development (Baez-Montenegro and Devesa-Fernandez, 2017; Christou et al., 2018). During cultural events, there is an increase in capacity usage of accommodation facilities through the connection between the place where the event is taking place and the cultural events can improve the image, planning and development of cultural tourism through the values and traditions of the community. This can increase revenues and enhance the growth of the destinations. According to O’Sullivian and Jackson (2002), local communities invest their funds in markets and promote events to provide travellers with a new and better experience. “If executed well, cultural events can generate more income and benefits” (Hernandez-Mogollon 34  et al. 2018: 170-178) “Cultural events are generally organised to create economic growth and enhance the image of tourist destinations”. Cultural events can produce images related to social and cultural life at the venue (Quinn, 2005: 927-943) As
