The various econometric esti-mations are used to measure the impact of governmentexpenditure on green economic recovery. The implementation ofpublic investment is explicitly associated with private funding.The results suggest that the government policy incentives andnon-government financing influence fossil fuel energy sourcesproportions on non-government investment, which is additionalthan the feed-in tariffs. According to fixed effects results, the dis-tribution of fossil fuel energy sources is an essential obstacle insolar energy investment. In contrast, the presence of varied typesof renewable energy encourages non-government climate invest-ment. Throughout the study period after the breakout of the pan-demic phase, neither fossil fuel energy sources nor economicpolicy is marginally efficient. The different macroeconomic pro-grams in green economic recovery might be ideal for attainingthe needed impact. The critical policy conclusion of the results ofthis research is that an influential role of the public and privateinvestment may be part of an optimal firm innovation plan forgreen economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 period.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 12 January 2022Accepted 20 May 2022KEYWORDSPublic finance; privatefinancing; green finance;economic recovery;COVID-19JEL CODESO16; P48; F65; G00; P451. IntroductionCOVID-19 has caused price fluctuation in energy carriers, impacting economicgrowth and triggering a worldwide recession and public unease due to its spread.Since the introduction ofimmunization programs, worldwide sectors have begun torecover from their losses, increasing employment and purchasing power and improv-ing overall economic activity(Azad et al., 2021).

Acrisis provides an opportunity to show how vital and urgent SDG adoption is in lightof varying people’s degrees of susceptibility and their varying core causes.Nevertheless, the economic recovery from the first plunge has been comparativelyrapid in the face of robust policy reactions measures (Chen et al., 2021; Gao et al.,2020; Huang et al., 2021; Lei et al., 2021). For instance, stock prices for significantindustries bounced back about 60% of their worth, which decreased nearly half a yearafter the first economic plunge (Caballero-Morales, 2021; Deardorff et al., 2020). Thepandemic has impacted all economies crunched, whether developed or developingcountries alike. So, there is now an apparent growing path to end the pandemic crisesby falling on mass inoculation programs in pace and magnitude (Hilbers et al., 2019;Khosravi et al., 2019; Kordej-De Villa & Slijepcevic, 2019; Ozoike-Dennis et al.,2019). However, the execution is multifaceted and risky, whereas the extended-termramifications of the Covid-19 on health, acquiring skills, and the quick spread of thetechnology continue to be significant in doubt (Abdullah et al., 2020; Gao et al.,2021; Haruna & M. Hanafiah, 2017; Soo Mun Peng, 2019).Furthermore, multilateral economic partnerships can play a significant part inCOVID-19 and reduce the risk of contagion. These multilateral partnerships could be thelong-run costs from the exceptional Covid-19 relics and optimize the gains from nationalcommitments to bounce back stronger (Mohsin et al., 2022a; 2022b). Thus, within thescenarios of more significant uncertainty in China, alongside creditors, on the whole, arescaling back credits, governments have come to their rescue by absorbing the growth incredit risk, making sure firms can access funding throughout the pandemic period (Fanget al., 2022; Mohsin et al., 2022a) and (Irfan et al., 2022). Moreover, the public sector iswell placed to give credit when there is a greater risk (Gootjes & de Haan, 2022).Governments have recapitalized state-run financial institutions concerning different hap-penings and increased public credit assurance policy. I.e., Comprising 70% to 90% of thecredit, assisted by vast buys of a portfolio of debts (He et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021).The possibility of quickly realizing varied policy choices among countries hinges on theinstitutional context (He et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2021). For instance, whiles certainnations have a good number of state-run financial institutions, the rest do not. Issuesregarding implementing this set of policies will increase to the degree that new supplychains might need to be formed (Raies, 2020).Several environmental and economic issues have been creating trouble for variousregions of the globe, depending on their population and geographic regions, such ashealth issues, flooding, drought, rising temperatures, forest fires, and storms (Sunet al., 2020; Tiep et al., 2021). Globalization has become a significant concern, par-ticularly when it comes to international economic systems. Financial institutions,businesses, and mass transit must have better access to developing markets.Decreased regulations and global economic openings promote financial services andthe global stock of assets and debts. Because of financial globalization, the financialECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1147sector is feasible. Voiced (Cantore & Freund, 2021) concern regarding the duration ofthese gains, stating that although confinement efforts implemented in the wake of theCOVID-19 epidemic resulted in cleaner air, the problem of air pollution was not sig-nificantly alleviated. We may thus deduce that recognizing the COVID-19-generatedaccidental positive benefits on the natural surroundings is premature and that theemphasis should instead be on how to preserve the acquired advantages via granularpolicy choices throughout the construction of COVID-19 stimuli and recovery pack-ages. (Baloch et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020).Corporate financing may not be reactive to reduce interest rates alongside thecoronavirus actions and the uncertainty about the headwinds’ scale and length.Also, certain central banks have equally sent cash assistance to financial institutionsat a reduced cost, with incentives to increase, resulting in the development of theactual economy. Unlike the usual financial crunch, financial institutions have notfaced liquidity challenges (Danielson et al., 2020). Instead, they ought to tacklealongside a separate expansion in the credit risk of companies that relies on thescale and length of the pandemic headwinds (Kr€uger & Meyer, 2021). Similarly,some investment gatekeepers have limited banks’ Basel III capital requirements incountercyclical capital buffers, conservation backups, systemic risk buffers, and pil-lar II costs. In addition, to be efficient, banks would require to change theannounced capital into greater crediting to enterprises within the context ofexpanded risk. These measures only may not give adequate inducements for themto do so. Additionally, not all nations have institutionalized incentives to do so(Agyekum et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021). Further, not all nations have institution-alized the Basel capital accord, and consequently, not the entire countries attain thelatitude to cut capital costs (Trading Economics, 2020).This paper evaluates the resilience, the ability to bounce back stronger from theeconomic headwinds of the coronavirus, provinces in the Canadian Union after the2008 financial crisis.Contribution To measure the outlook of government expenditure for economicrecovery by using econometric estimations and the mediating role of public and pri-vate investment.

DAI ET AL.The rest of the analysis is arranged as follows: The following units present abroader view of the context of the study. Section three sheds light on the dataset esti-mations methods, whereas section four discusses the descriptive analysis and the find-ings of the econometric approach. Eventually, the final unit ends the study withconclusions and policy consequences.2. Literature reviewSeveral analyses have formally evaluated the association between the pandemic and thefinancial markets on the presumptions that financial markets respond quickly to news ofcontagion outbreak, giving a quick redlight concerning contagion diffusion’s economic con-sequences (Guo et al., 2022). For instance, Suescun (2020) discover significant volatilityamongst China’s stock markets indexes and the bitcoin through the heights of the contagion(Stoian & Iorgulescu, 2020). Another expansion in the association of stock market returnsbetween China and the group of seven nations through the pandemic phase: high-levelfinancial companies over non-financial companies (Chien et al., 2021; Iqbal et al., 2021; Liet al., 2021). Batool et al. (2021) discovered that the correlation is lopsided and varies inmagnitude and locations at several quantiles. Overall, asset profits are responsive to theincrease in the pandemic deaths (Mirza et al., 2020a, 2022; Naqvi et al., 2021). Song andZhou (2020) finds that meaningfully adverse performance of equities and commodities plusspikes in the volatility of their profits are correlated to reported growths in the contagioncases. Lang and Schadner (2021) recorded a meaningful plunge in the stock profits ofChinese companies related to the affirmed amounts of the pandemic cases and fatalities(Mirza et al., 2020b; 2020c; Mosser, 2021; Yarovaya et al., 2021). Consider a reputational-based pandemic view of contagion and depict the enterprises with corona-correlated cor-porate images negatively functioned through the pandemic. Additionally, responding to thenews of the pandemic reported cases, investors react to different pandemic correlated newsin the form of policy measures and other releases by the regulators.Azad et al. (2021) detects the systemic danger in the financial institutions of theareas of the impacted nations grew from the beginning and attains uniformity withinApril 2020. Different research studies have evaluated markets’ response to the pan-demic correlated information, comprising policy interruptions and lockdown policies.Similarly, applying China’s investment market data depicts those domestic stocksresponding to the contagion reports before those companies with global footprints.They contend that this analysis is proof of information lopsidedness. So, in evaluatingthe response of the United States of America industry profits to the pandemic corre-lated news and policy reports. Chang et al. (2020) have it that specific sectors like res-taurants and hotels experienced adversely unusual profits, whereas others, comprisingof pharmaceutical products areas, had remarkable direct gains. Agosto and Giudici(2020) discover meaningful associations between the trading volumes of 26 stocksmarkets and the volume of reported cases and fatalities. Rizvi et al. (2020) found thatwhile most investment funds suffered during the Covid-19 outbreak from January toJune, social entrepreneurship funds remained resilient. Mirza et al. (2020a) exploredthat the spread of Covid-19 was a significant surprise, and it caused a global financialmarket crash between January and May 2020.ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 1149Entrepreneurship funds had a positive effect. Hasnaoui et al. (2020) suggested thatfunds invest in human capital to increase their funds’ resilience to stress on the humancapital efficiency during COVID-19 in five EU countries. Countries. Rizvi et al. (2020)concluded that the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak impacted several businesses acrossEurope. It shows the sales growth and cash flow, potentially increasing corporate bank-ruptcies. The data imply that a tax deferral is adequate for a moderate economic decline.Mirza et al. (2020) concluded that investments can increase the human capital efficiencyto overcome macroeconomic shocks during COVID 19 in Latin America.Yarovaya et al. (2020) conducted a study on the contrast between the risk-adjustedperformance, investment approaches, and volatility timing of Islamic equities fundswith conventional equity funds. Specifically, Islamic equities funds outperformednon-Islamic peers during the peak months of the epidemic, indicating that they aremore resilient to COVID-19 shocks. So, to increase the financial system’s resilience tofuture black swan events, policymakers should look into Islamic financial assets andtheir principles. Rizvi et al. (2020) explored the influence on non-financial Europeanfirm valuations. They consider the effect of COVID-19 on predicted sales and thecost of equity. As a result of lower sales and higher equity costs, values have fallenacross all industries. Naqvi et al. (2021) explored those institutional sizes and nationsshow significant asset quality declines, and defective capital and default risk haveincreased in COVID 19 in UEU. Naqvi et al. (2021) studied the COVID 19 epi-demic, Asian equity funds’ performance, market, and instability. It is found thatinvestments with higher human capital efficiency outperform funds with lower effi-ciency in 16 COVID-19 diseases in Asian countries.Paule-Vianez et al. (2022) evaluated the bond markets that provide insurance for bit-coin uncertainty indices. According to et al. (2021), green energy-based investments haveincreased due to socio-economic effects and increased funding flows and concluded thatthe green funds outperform brown and black funds risk-adjusted. Naqvi et al. (2021)highlighted that green financing increase the capital adequacy of banks due to the lowcash flow volatility of carbon-neutral financial creditors. Ji et al. (2021) investigated theinfluence of rising commodity prices on capital adequacy. The results reveal that spreadsdecreased during the oil shock, and it has emerged as a winner in US economic uncer-tainty. Price volatility is a risk for Bitcoin in the US (Rabbani et al., 2021; Ullah et al.,2021) formulated a consumer purchase fear index and depicted that the twofold domesticand global virus spread the news and government policy releases elucidate the flows inthe fear index. These analyses imply that information movements regarding the doubledocumented pandemic incidence and policy implementations are vital to determinefinancial cost flows. The body of knowledge indicates that the correlation between thepandemic incidence and asst profits is country peculiar, relying partly on how freely infor-mation is circulated and on financers’ confidence in a country’s institutions.3. Data and methodology3.1. DataWe use data from the Bloomberg New energy finance repository, economic cooper-ation, development organization, and the World Bank development indicators. Data1150 X.

As explained straightforwardly byGuild (2020), self-projects may have different investors. The resulting governmentand private methods separate the government and non-government parts and projectswith heterogeneous investors (Olakojo et al., 2021). To ensure the comprehend theeffect of government and non-government investment, which explain in the givenequation beneath, to be the dual integration of non-government investors regardingprojects where government investment needs to occur and future years projects.Further, the world bank development indicators provide data on per annum neces-sary energy requirement per head. The organization’s Economic cooperation develop-ment per annum dataset system gives data on various policy tools implementednationwide, entailing market-based mechanisms, i.e., tax cuts and different incentivesand non-market tools. i.e., command and control. Table 1 shows the systemof variables.3.2. MethodologyTo the national bureau of economic research work, the economic recession beganbriefly after the subprime mortgage problem in December 2007and went on fornearly half of 2009. Over 15 million people forever lost their jobs throughout thisperiod, the unemployment rate expanded from almost 4.8% to almost 10%, and actualgross domestic product fell. Hence, the urgency of formulating an appropriate monet-ary policy to counterbalance the crisis and improve an economic build-back increaseddramatically. By utilizing a fixed model estimated by way of total generalized leastsquares estimators, the model is constructed below (model 1):Public investment ¼ a þ b1Pinvþ b2STax þ b3EFP þ b4CFP þ b5GDP þ b6rþ b7EMP þ b8CMP (1)Pinv is represented private investment, STax depicts stringency tax, EFP depictsexpansionary fiscal policy, Interest is represented by r, EMP represents the expansion-ary monetary policy, and CMP depicts contractionary fiscal policy.

Such estimators create room for moderate endogeneity between dependent andexploratory variables. Notably, the independent variables may associate with the ran-dom variable; instrumenting parameters pass this context alongside previous level fig-ures of the experimental variables. Overall, a rationale suitable variable essentially hasto meet these necessities: (i) To obtain a correlation with the estimator nonetheless (ii)To obtain a correlation with the random variable. Although the analysis tests therobustness of the variables, it is clear that the previous figures could be weakly externalto the model. i.e., they are linked to the random variable at phase T (Dorsey-Palmateer& Niu, 2020). The first differenced model presents a consistent asymptotically efficientestimate with heteroscedasticity. Thus, the present, which also requires not robustlyexogenous variables, is grounded on modifying the dependent variable as verticaldigression deviation since the changed random term assumes a complete variance andis not correlated. Within these models, the rigor of the variables is confirmed by utiliz-ing the analysis. Also called the J-statistic, for the interpretation of overidentifying con-straints. (equally known as J-statistic) (Embrett et al., 2021; Klomp, 2020; Loayza &Pennings, 2020). Mainly analyze the vertical amongst the variables and the random var-iables. Within the analysis, an instrument for parameters is the previous values of theendogenous variables. Concerning the Arellano-Bond approximator, analyze the pres-ence of sequential correlation (Sarwar et al., 2020).In addition, (i) an entire generalized least square on a static longitudinal with thefixed effect. (Equation 1) (ii) a full generalized least square on dynamic longitudinalalongside fixed development (Equation 2). Further, all models are reevaluated differ-ently for the different double types of generations sources, Wind and Solar, suggest-ing the other time series for investment and feed-in tariffs regarding theseproductions’ types. Due to the variables in Equations (1) and (2) being estimated indifferent approximations are levelized, causing the authors to analogy the estimatedfactors. The endogenous variable Puinv is not standardized. Nonetheless, it is seen ina log form. Hence, this ensures that the authors comprehend and estimate the factorsas fractions variations in the stage of personal investment; afterward, a single stand-ard deviation increases in the set of the selected exogenous parameters.4. Results and discussion4.1. Private investment during the Covid-19 pandemicTo evaluate the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on economic recovery, approxi-mating the impacts of monetary policy on the financial market. It analyzes various1152 X. DAI ET AL.scholarly works to estimate public and private investment variations for eco-nomic recovery.Results in Table 2 shows that a country’s prevailing energy freedom affects theincentives to invest in renewable energy sources. This evaluation is due to an exclu-sive group of countries that show noticeable varied features concerning domestictrading of goods and services. Countries that rely on traditional energy productionsources have limited Interest in investing in solar energy. Despite owing ecologicalcontext approval for solar energy, Australia rightly demonstrates this practice ownone of the reduced finance stages for solar energy investment between the organiza-tion for economic cooperation development. i.e., the renewable energy sourcesaltogether, owing principally to the critical consumption of traditional energy sources,producing 0.015ktoe of conventional energy per source.This finding seems to be opposite to the experimental associated with an expan-sion stock in index profits (Table 3). For instance, Loayza and Pennings (2020) dis-covered the ten-year government bond yield. i.e., the substitute interest rates andstock profits flow similarly in EU nations, irrespective of whether it changes in timeplus crosswise time differences (Martınez-Rodriguez et al., 2020). I have noticed theco-advancement amongst the ten-year Treasury yields and stock profits centered on asample of a group of seven nations. For instance, a fall in the policy explains anexpansionary monetary policy, and financers anticipate inflation. Alike, inflationanticipations cause financiers to expect raw material costs, resulting in more signifi-cant investment costs and lower corporate returns. In this vein, corporate valuationsplunge, and financing profits fall in the short run. In another scenario, when the cen-tral bank cuts policy rates, investors see the economic growth potential to be discour-aging and diminish their stock holdings. Hence, reducing the interest rates couldmake stock profits fall.Table 2.

When the analysis was carried out on the effects of varied programsinstrument, it unraveled that expansion in taxes on traditional sources and the feed-in tariffs directly affects private investment in monetary policy, which is beneath thegrowth levels generated by private investment. Different from model 1 and model 2,a varying panel model is estimated starting with past private and government invest-ment values. The first analysis estimated with the entire generalized least square inmodels one and two is confirmed by the remainder of models three and six, whosefactors are estimated using OLS estimators; An expansion in direct governmentinvestment spurs the substantial. Investment affects non-public investment or the pri-vate sector.

Feed-in tariffFeed-in tariffs also determine private investment in renewable energy sources; none-theless, the effect is methodically beneath what they produced by direct governmentinvestment. The exchange rate and policy rate are meaningfully adversely associated.That implies that the tightening monetary policy will result in deprecations ofexchange rates. Several studies have been done on the same finding. For instanceKlomp and Sseruyange (2021), Putnam (2021) and Tian (2021) formulate a frame-work of currency headwind and conclude that expansion in domestic interest ratesmight lead to a devaluation of the domestic currency.

Thus, an expansion in policy ratios can trigger CDS expansionto increase. Inversely, a growth in policy percentages starts a thriving economy tofall. The bond issuers’ resettlement burden expands quickly and causes a danger ofnonpayment. After the demand for safeguarding against risk, the CDS diffusiongrows.

As it is understood, the dual traditional and modern monetary policies are prin-cipally growing throughout the pandemic. The growth of current economic policiesmay cause market actors to be extra cynical concerning the economy, making thestock index fall.The impact of traditional monetary policies on exchange rates varies from the con-ventional monetary policy. Growth in conventional monetary policy results in adevaluation of the local currency, in harmony with the findings derived by Inoue andRossi (2019). Within the timeframe, it can summarize that in Table two, traditionalor modern monetary policies have meaningful impacts on all four financial marketindicators throughout the pandemic phase. Table 6 shows fixed effect analysis.An explicit coefficient of about 10% is found in models one to three. Conversely,nonsignificant factors are depicted in four and six. Regulatory actions such as pollu-tion standards don’t result in a positive effect on self-clean energy investment. Thisextraordinary analysis results from a statistical issue linked to the approximation ofthe variable analysis in Table 7.From the analysis, the evaluation depicts that the total level of human activity onthe gross domestic product directly affects self-investment in models (1), (2), and (6).At the same time, energy per capita has a non-meaningful effect on the quantum ofTable 4.

It is observed the twofold all-encompassing part of total efficiency.The reach efficiency lowered next to 2015, and slow macroeconomic growth in con-formity alongside the path of the world’s economy. Initially, financiers did not antici-pate the young, insufficient, and uncertain monetary policies implementedthroughout the coronavirus phase. This inadequate past knowledge deals with nessreactive actors to economic policies than they would have been in usual times.Nonetheless, some researches depict that significant asset is comparatively ineffectivein giving a haven for financiers (Ji et al., 2020). Financiers are less likely to moveliquidity assets by substituting investment assets when the pandemic is spreading glo-bally and causing systematic risk. As a result, they respond less after monetary pol-icy releases.4.3.

The rationale for this decimating impact will be elucidated later. Indeed, thefindings in Elyassi (2021) contend that through the coronavirus stage, the adverseheadwinds on the United States policy rate yet result in a spillover currency devalu-ation of 10 in the developed world plus 25 in the developing world, which seems con-trary to the findings. As a result of the dollar’s standing, the United States monetarypolicy will logically trigger the variations of exchange rates against the United Statesdollar in several nations. Instead, examine the effect of the pandemic on the spreadof the nation’s self-monetary policy to its investment markets. Without evaluating thedata, a viewpoint that throughout the pandemic phase; nonetheless, it can’t solve theeconomic downturn. The experiential findings imply that monetary policy becomesless effective in controlling investment markets throughout the coronavirus stage.Consequently, the results corroborate the view (Mundle & Sahu, 2021) to a certainlevel and give additional compelling proof for the economic efficacy.4.4. Robustness analysisThe source of government financing has an explicit and noticeable association withthe self-financing flow in the entire models interpreted, highlighting a common factorbetween self-flow and government financing. The variables of government finance areclear at present levels and crosswise phases.

The economy through 2018 performed wellalongside gross domestic product expansion of 2.9% plus at 3.9% and the expansionlasting in 2019. Within the middle of 2019, economic growth had reduced grossdomestic product.4.5. DiscussionThe quick expansion and high-level stage of transmissibility of the pandemic occa-sioned the health experts to admonish public works to restrict movement, limitationson human activity, and lockdowns crosswise the nation. Also, human activity neededpersonal contacts, big crowds such as churches, the education sector, and other socialgatherings. Commercial activity was the first-hand impact, earnings declined, and theUnited States stock investment companies expanded drastically. They significantlyincreased the non-availability of funds within the Treasury market (Lacalle, 2020). Toundertake initial juxtapositions amongst the twofold crises-The Global Financial crisisand the coronavirus, the Fed’s financial position grew from $1 trillion in late 2008 to$4.5 T in late 2014. They stayed that way from 2015-to 2017. Likewise, the Fed wentahead with Quantitative contraction through the dual 2018 and 2019 and limited itsfinancial position to $3.6 T. Further, this exceptional expansion of about $3.4 T real-ized a global financial crisis.Moreover, the source of this health emergency this time is an external healthcareheadwind, and huge doubts have encircled nearly all parts of the coronavirus crisis.Uncertainty indicators have attained their most significant figures in response to thepandemic and its breakout. Almost half a year after the flight of the coronavirus, littleis sure about the disease. Uncertainties comprise the infectiousness and the long-runhealthcare impact of the pandemic, the efficacy of the control measures, the period ofTable 8.

Additionally, to the uncer-tainty concerning the pandemic, there is doubt about the COVID-19’s duration,whether in the short or long-run economic impacts.Within the short run, there is a real discourse, for instance, concerning the scaleof the corona crisis, the pace of ultimate bouncing back, and the efficacy of variouspolicies (Taghizadeh-Hesary et al., 2021; Taghizadeh-Hesary & Taghizadeh-Hesary,2020; Taghizadeh-Hesary & Yoshino, 2019; 2020). In this vein, taking into accountthe extended horizon, there are significant doubts about whether the corona will gen-erate endless variations in the manner of economic activity, making certain firmsthrive and different ones collapse (Truger, 2020). The corona has increased some dif-ferences that were already within the way. Notably, the lockdown and restrictionshave increased by applying digital technologies that encourage virtual communicationand networking. The coronavirus has equally brought about an essential change inconsumer expenditure and financing trends. Nonetheless, the point that these flowsin economic activity will exist in the aftermath of the pandemic is yet to be observed.Unlike the past crisis, economies confronted an amalgamation of distributionheadwinds throughout the pandemic breakout. Most quickly, workers could notwork, impacting production, disrupting distribution chains, freezing financing, and ademand headwind, making households and companies limit their demand for goodsand services that have strengthened one another (Marelli, 2021). The range of the cri-sis is equally wide-ranging as in the previous macro-financial situation. Thus, thepandemic headwind has spread rapidly within the national boundaries across theworld, bearing on economies globally in a highly synchronized manner. The effects ofthe integrated headwinds on companies have not been precedent. It has resulted in aquick fall in corporate earnings; corporate cash movements have reduced at unheardof rates. Companies have struggled to become viable as the pandemic decimates theirseed capital which is consistent with Deng and Zhao (2022) and Ye et al. (2021).Table 9.

The findings illustratethat the liquidity access could aid companies in containing the coronavirus headwinds;nonetheless, the accessible liquidity would not be adequate in certain instances. Forinstance, certain firms that have been hit badly by the pandemic crisis, such as restau-rants, retail shops, and service companies, would last for only a few weeks if earningsstopped entirely and expenditures stayed at before pandemic levels. Hence, companies’willingness to function within the coronavirus relies not only on the scale of the fall oftheir earnings but also on whether they can maximize additional financing and desireto modify expenditures. i.e., salaries, supplier payments, and other operating costs.5. Conclusions and policy implicationsThis study measures an outlook of government financing for green economic recoverymediating the role of public and private investment. This research deliberates on econo-metric modeling and concentrates on public and private investment, and green eco-nomic recovery in Canada outlines the robustness of macroeconomic policy to attainspecific objectives. This assessing framework is measured by an econometric equationapplying monthly data for 2001–2020. Using econometric approximation, changing amodel to calculate the before and after crisis phase. The result shows the proof thatquantitative easing and the Fed’s extensive commitments of more than seven years tocut long-run interest rates have proven to be statistically significant. Hence, the researchreports that the observed fall in jobs is precisely linked to the economic recovery.Likewise, the feed-in-tarrif reacted by reducing the funds rate to 1.25% on March 3and a few days later to 0.25% on March 15. So, by lowering the fed fund level to zero,they quickly and widely reported several measures to balance the financial system andthe Canada’s economy. These undertakings are explained in detail and equally draw aparallel on whether the pandemic measures are identical to those implemented throughthe global financial crisis or novel, specially formulated for the coronavirus. Thus, theanalysis shows that the emergence of the coronavirus has made fragile the spread ofmacroeconomic policies to investment markets to government spending for green eco-nomic recovery even when the condition parameters are considered. Further, the estima-tion findings of the condition of the parameters depict that the varied backgrounds ofindustrialization and investment advancement deteriorate the effect of the pandemic onmonetary policy. If a country attains a greater fossil fuel energy resources or nonrenew-able energy consumption stage, the renewable energy generation for green economy havebeen interrupted, and the demand for nonrenewable energy consumption has reducedsince the pandemic breakout. The variations in the effect of the coronavirus spread onmacroeconomic policy due to varying levels fossil fuel energy sources proportion of gov-ernment spending and public and private sectors investment for climate change to attaingreen economic recovery.Nevertheless, a high-level stage of trade openness could decrease some of the dete-riorating effects of the coronavirus spread on macroeconomic policy. Additionally,the fiscal policies implemented via the pandemic directly affect the exchange rate and1160 X. DAI ET AL.DCS to a certain level. The research equally proposes areas of research on resiliencethat require additional research. The initial is necessary to include estimating elucidat-ing the resistances and bounce back comprising. Hence, the third aspect of research isthe role of social distance standards and different earnings statuses at a provincial levelin impacting the capability of countries to confront and bounce back from the head-winds in the form of the pandemic. Surprised by the coronavirus and its resultant eco-nomic headwinds have been the inadequate consistent global financial crisis. Policyformulators have effectively increased crisis measures from the 2008 financial crisis andhave implemented tentative debt services relief for the developing nations.In certain countries, debt sustainability will need to be faced on all fronts. When itultimately occurs, monetary policy regularization could result in participation of pub-lic and private investment for green economic recovery. This study suggests globalskills in different areas to tackle these correlated challenges. The initial is for theinternational monetary policy to carry the overall allotment of economic bounce backas a source of cash. A multilateral control trust fund could recycle special drawingrights allotments from different nations that don’t require to those that need it. Thenext suggestion is to formulate a group of twenty nations’ new standard model forsovereign debt compositing, launched in late 2020. Improvements should add moreprominent information instruments and a complete public debt repository.Third, the International monetary fund ought to formulate best practice recom-mendations for standardizing economic policy as the impacts of the corona dimin-ishes, in line with improved protective lending institutions.Ultimately, structural reforms to deepen capital markets in emerging nations oughtto comprise: an expanded commitment to floating sustainable bonds by the group of20 and securitization and credit warranties to maximize the financial position ofmultilateral development institutions.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.FundingThis research was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for the Excellent Young Researcher of theMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (MEXT); Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (No. 22K13432) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(JSPS) and the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) (No. 22H03816) of the JSPS.ORCIDFarhad Taghizadeh-Hesary http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5446-7093ReferencesAbdullah, M., Mamat, M.
