Introduction In the history of human society, there has never beena state without taxes. The most of the money required for the state to carry out its internal and external J.D.H. Vol. 23 (No. 2): 1-21 | DOI: 10.20884/1.jdh.%Y.%v.%i.3474 [2]  functions, including diverse social, economic, and political actions, is also raised through taxes in a market economy. Taxesprovide the Republican Party with funding  and local budgets, provide the funding for state social programs, oversee the commercial operations of  encouraging taxpayers to use natural resources wisely, influence pricing, and set living standards (Isabella & Nematulla, 2021). Indonesia entered a new phase in the Legislative System after the Indonesian residence of Representatives and the Government approved the Bill of Job Creation Act into law in the House of representatives plenary session on October 5, 2020. The bill was then ratified or signed by the President of the Republic of Indonesia and promulgated on October 2, 2020. November 2020 in the State Gazette of 2020 Number 245 under the name of Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation. The Job Creation Act has the format of an omnibus law or an umbrella act because it is a legal umbrella covering 76 laws. The Job Creation Act has the following objectives: creating and increasing employment opportunities, adjusting various regulatory aspects related to the investment ecosystem, being useful in promoting economic recovery, and suppressing the high cost economy. To support the implementation of strategic job creation policies and their arrangements, it is necessary to amend and improve various related laws. Changes to the law cannot be carried out through conventional methods by changing laws one by one as has been done so far. This method is certainly ineffective,inefficient and takes a long time. The Job Creation Act also includes taxation clusters listed in Chapter VI Part Seven which contains 4 articles, namely Articles 111, 112, 113, and 114. The tax cluster regulates changes to articles in the regulation on standard Provisions and Tax tactics (UU KUP), profits Tax law (UU PPh), and regulation on cost delivered Tax on items and services and sales Tax on luxury goods (VAT and PPn BM), as well as the Law on Regional Taxes and Levies (UU PDRD). What is the purpose of the changes made to KUP Act, Income Tax Act, PPN and PPNBM Law in the omnibus law on job creation. Suryo Utomo, Director General of Taxes, said the various tax policies adopted in Law Number 2 of 2020 and the Job Creation Act lead to ease of doing business. He made this statement during a media briefing on Monday, October 12, 2020. The tax policy is expected to be able to make the economy grow, especially after the Covid-19 pandemic. The Director General of Taxes stated that it is also a fundamental part of tax reform. The hope is that economic activity can grow even faster. The various policies adopted at least carry 4 aspects of objectives in the context of ease of doing business (DDTCNews, 2020), that is: Increasing investment funding, Encouraging Taxpayer Compliance and Voluntary Taxpayers, Legal Aspects Of Taxation...  Yulianto Syahyu  [3] Increasing legal certainty, and Creating a reasonable trade climate within the nation. Based on the 4 aspects of the objectives of taxation reform through the Job Creation Act (and Law Number 2 of 2020), it can be concluded that the tax cluster in the job creation omnibus law prioritizes the regular and end functions of taxes. It is common knowledge that the primary function of the tax is the function of the budget, namely the function of government revenue. As a source of government revenue, taxes function to funding state expenditures. The second function is the regularend/regulating function, taxes reflect the country's economic policies. The government can regulate economic growth through tax policies. The prioritization of the regularend function is also reflected in the initial proposal for the omnibus law on taxation, in December 2019, which was named the “A bill on tax provisions and facilities to boost the economy”. Taxes are a important source of government revenue for government and national development. As a result, the government views the tax obligation as one manifestation of the state's obligations and a way to finance the state in National Development in order to achieve state goals (Enny Agustina, 2020).  The government has come to the conclusion that we can no longer rely on state revenues from oil and gas resources or external debt to finance routine spending and national development today and in the future. Therefore, an increase in tax revenue is a must for meeting the needs of state expenditure funds in order to improve facilities and infrastructure in a country. Dichotomously, the tax function can be divided into two large groups; they are the budgetair function and the regulerend function. Budgetair function is a function that is located in the public sector and tax is a tool to put as much money as possible into the state treasury, which in turn will be issued to finance state expenditures. While the regulerend function is a function in which taxes are used as a tool to achieve certain goals that are outside the field of state finance. In concrete terms, this function is manifested in the form of increasing or decreasing tariffs to provide incentives or disincentives so that the government's goals can be achieved. The function of regulerend substantively is actually a certain way to engineer the socio-economic conditions of a more just and equitable society, including in the field of social economic law. For this reason, the author sees that in fact the tax function is not only merely collecting money into the state treasury but also more importantly taxes as a tool to regulate how the state treasury can be regulated and utilized more comprehensively through the regulerend function itself both in implementing social policies and other policies in tax fields. J.D.H. Vol. 23 (No. 2): 1-21 | DOI: 10.20884/1.jdh.%Y.%v.%i.3474 [4]  The government's well-designed national tax reform policy is expected to serve as a learning tool for creating policies for the government as a party with the authority to anticipate potential economic crises in the future. It can essentially support national financing through regulatory reform and modern tax administration with policies in tax practice that combine tax functions as an instrument of fiscal policy.  Research Problems  Based on the description provided above, there are several problems that can be formulated in this study and will be presented the formulation of the problem. First, how does the regulerend function in Indonesian tax reform? Second, how does the Tax Policy affect ease of doing business and National Economic Resilience?  Research Methods  The type of research is about a legal approach to observing and analyzing issues through existing legalrules. The information source utilized is additional information which is separated into three groups, specifically primary legitimate materials, secondary lawful materials, and tertiary lawful materials. All of which the author used as a foundation for addressing the issues under consideration and are reliable sources. In terms of gathering information, the author did so by taking into account the articles and other legal materials pertinent to the investigation; at that point, all of them were prepared through subjective investigation, specifically defining legal materials gathered in order to respond  the issue (Alfian Mahendra & Beniharmoni Harefa, 2020).  Discussion  Regularend Function in Indonesian Tax Reform  One of the main functions of taxes is the regularend (regulating) function, namely as a tool to achieve certain goals in the financial sector, and more generally also in other fields such as economics, politics, culture, defense and security. With the regularend function, taxes can be used as a means to an end. The government can regulate economic growth, employment opportunities; encourage investment and so on through fiscal policy (tax policy and state finances). Moreover, fiscal policy according to Jhinghan in Erly Suandy has the following objectives (Erly Suandy, 2017): a. Increase the rate of investment b. Encourage socially optimal investment Legal Aspects Of Taxation...  Yulianto Syahyu  [5] c. increase job opportunities d. Increase economic stability in the midst of international instability e. In an effort to control inflation f. Increase and distribute national income The regularend function during the validity period of the Dutch colonial tax law, prior to the 1983 tax reform, can be seen from the provision of tax facilities in Article 16 of Law Number 11 of 1970 concerning Amendments and Supplements to Law Number 11 of 1967 concerning Foreign Investment. For new agencies that invest in the production sector that receives priority from the government, the Minister of Finance has the authority to provide corporate tax exemptions for a period of 2 years (tax free period, tax holiday) commencing from the time the company starts production. At that time, among others were: the 1925 Company Tax Ordinance (PPs), the 1944 Income Tax Ordinance (PPd), Law Number 8 of 1967 concerning changes and improvements to the procedures for collecting Income Tax 1944, the Wealth Tax (PKk) 1932, and the Company Tax. 1925; Law Number 10 of 1970 concerning Taxes on Interest, Dividends and Royalties (PBDR). Tax reform is characterized by the passage of: a. Law Number 28 of 2007 concerning the Third Amendment to Law Number 6 of 1983 concerning General Provisions and Tax Procedures, last amended by Law Number 16 of 2009. b. Law Number 36 of 2008 concerning the Fourth Amendment to Law Number 7 of 1983 concerning Income Tax. c. Law Number 42 of 2009 concerning the Third Amendment to Law Number 8 of 1983 concerning Value Added Tax and Sales Tax on Luxury Goods. d. Law Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation. e. Law Number 7 of 2021 concerning Harmonization of Tax Regulations.  1. Tax Reform through the Tax Omnibus Law A study of the material for changes to the KUP Law, PPh Law, PPN and PPnBM Law in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation (Omnibus law of the Job Creation Act) and how the regularend function works through changes to these provisions. It is known that the Job Creation Act also includes taxation clusters listed in Chapter VI Part Seven which contains 4 articles, namely Articles 111, 112, 113, and 114. Through this study, to find out what is the purpose of the changes to the KUP Law, Income Tax Law, VAT Law and PPnBM within the omnibus regulation of the job advent law? The objectives are 1) Tax Reform through the Tax Omnibus Law Bill; 2) Tax Clusters in J.D.H.

Targets of Tax Reform On December 5, 2019, the Government and the Indonesian House of Representatives have established two Omnibus Law Bills that are included in the 2020 priority National Legislation Program (Prolegnas). Both are the Omnibus Law on Job Creation and the Omnibus Law on Taxation. The Tax Omnibus Law Bill or the Tax Provisions and Facilities Bill for Economic Strengthening includes 6 pillars, namely: 1) Investment financing, 2) Territorial system, 3) Personal tax issues, 4) Taxpayer compliance, 5) Business climate fairness and 6) Facility. The background/reasons and objectives of the amendment tax law can be seen based on the conclusions in the instructional Paper of the Draft law on Tax Provisions and facilities for monetary strengthening, among others, namely  (Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia, Academic Paper of the Draft Law on Tax Provisions and Facilities for Economic Strengthening): 1. Some of the problems faced are related to the implementation of current tax policies so that it is necessary to reorganize some tax policies, including: a. there are funding obstacles within the context of supplying investment budget, both from domestic and foreign country, to improve the economy; b. there are differences in the interpretation of the taxation popularity of certain tax subjects which ends up in uncertainty within the tax responsibilities of certain Indonesian citizens and the shortage of interest of foreign nationals with certain skills to work in Indonesia; c. compared to the threat of an economic downturn brought on by unfair business actor input tax credit arrangements, administrative penalties, and interest rate support that disrupt voluntary taxpayer compliance and don't support the taxpayer's business continuity; d. there is a legal vacuum to obtain Indonesian state tax rights about the provision of goods or services from foreign business actors to domestic buyers or service users and inequality in tax treatment between domestic business actors and foreign business actors in relation to trade in goods and/or services through electronic systems. 2.

Indonesia did not escape this pandemic, and one of the sides that was significantly affected was the economic and fiscal sector.

It is also necessary to establish state financial policies and other policies to stabilize the financial system. The State's financial policies include: The State's revenue policy, including the tax policy, the State's spending policy, including the regional financial policy, and the funding (Article 1 paragraph (4) of the Perpu).

Yulianto Syahyu  [9]  4) Authorizes the Minister of Finance will provide customs facilities in the form of duty-free or duty-free imports to deal with emergencies and to restore and strengthen the national economy. Customs facilities with exemption/relief of Import Duty are regulated in a Regulation of the Minister of Finance. Actually, the first of two policies were originally part of the Tax Omnibus Law (RUU on tax provisions and economic enhancement facilities). However, the policy of reducing the corporate income tax rate and the imposition of taxes on trade in goods and/or services through an electronic system has been contained in Perppu Number 1 of 2020 Jo Law Number 2 of 2020.

Tax Policy for Ease of Doing Business for National Economic Resilience The Taxation Cluster is regulated in CHAPTER VI of the Job Creation Act with the title of the Chapter “Ease of Doing Business”. Article 105 explicitly states that "To make it easier for business actors to invest, this Law amends, deletes, or stipulates a new arrangement of several provisions regulated in: It can be clearly understood that the purpose of the amendment to the three tax laws is one part of the grand plan of drafting the Job Creation Act as an Omnibus law which is the legal umbrella for the dozens of laws in it. How can the tax policy in the taxation cluster of the Job Creation Act play the regular end function of the tax? To respond the question, it is also necessary to review the provisions of tax policy in Perppu Number 1 of 2020 Jo. Law No. 2 of 2020 concerning the State's financial policy and the stability of the financial system to manage the Covid-19 pandemic and/or in the face of threats to the national economy and/or the stability of the financial system. Based on what was conveyed by Suryo Utomo, Director General of Taxes, in the Media Briefing Monday (DDTCNews, 2020) and also described in the internal Legal Aspects Of Taxation...  Yulianto Syahyu  [15] socialization material of the Directorate General of Taxes (Directorate General of Taxes, Law Number 2020 Ease of Doing Business Cluster: Taxation, internal socialization material, 10 November 2020), it was concluded that the various taxation/state finance policies accommodated in job creation Act carried 4 aspects of objectives in ease of doing business context: 1. Strengthening investment financing 2. Encouraging obedient taxpayers and voluntary tax payers 3. Increasing legal certainty 4. Creating an equal business environment in the country. The four aspects mentioned above are to stimulate national economic growth and at least to maintain national economic stability and resilience. Experience has shown that if a country's economy is destroyed, other variables such as politics and security will also be disrupted. Indonesia did not escape this experience, where the end of the New Order regime in 1998, which had been in power for 32 years, started from an economic recession to the difficulty of obtaining basic necessities, thus making the New Order regime end its rule.

Taxation of digital transactions by foreign sellers or marketplaces. This policy has been regulated in Perppu Number 1 of 2020 jo. Law No. 2 of 2020. b. Inclusion of NIK (Population Identification Number) of buyers who do not have NPWP in the Tax Invoice. Based on the description of various tax policies that are accommodated in Perppu Number 1 of 2020 Jo. Law Number 2 of 2020 and the Employment Creation Law, the function of regular and end taxes in the context of facilitating business for national economic growth can work in the following ways. Legal Aspects Of Taxation...  Yulianto Syahyu  [17] First, in the context of funding investment in Indonesia, tax incentives on dividends from within the country are intended to reduce the tax burden (Muhammad Djafar Saidi, 2018) that must be borne by taxpayers. Lower income tax on interest or other income from abroad will be an attraction for direct investment from abroad in Indonesia as well as to stimulate the domestic economy. Second, differences in the interpretation of the determination of taxable status affects the country or jurisdiction that has the power to impose the tax, so it is necessary to provide legal certainty in the form of rules asserting taxable status, to know for Indonesian citizens who are staying in Indonesia for no more than 183 days in 12 months and foreigners who been in Indonesia for more than 183 days in 12 months. So far, the difference in interpretation has burdened the tax subject with complex tax administration obligations. In addition, there are arrangements that are expected to attract foreigners with special skills (expatriate) to work in Indonesia, only subject to tax on income originating in Indonesia (not on all income). Third, regulation (relaxation) of provisions for crediting Input Tax, which is considered unfair for business actors. Input Tax crediting rights are now granted on expenses related to business activities and the VAT has been paid (with a limit of 80%). In addition, there are regulations on tax administrative penalties. Fourth, the regulation on the amount of administrative sanctions of interest applied by taking into account market interest rates. The same applies to interest payments that must be paid by the government. Such arrangements aim to provide justice and encourage voluntary compliance by taxpayers. So far, the administrative sanctions are considered burdensome (2% per month) and does not distinguish between imposing sanctions on determination and sanctions that arise because the Taxpayer corrects his mistakes voluntarily. Due to this condition, it often interferes with the taxpayer's ability to conduct business, which in turn encourages behavior that avoids paying taxes and other obligations. Fifth, the rapid development of electronic transactions in the national economy. Taxation of digital transactions carried out by foreign sellers or marketplaces (Trade Through Electronic Systems) is an effort to enforce the taxation rights of the Indonesian state and to ensure equality of tax treatment between domestic business actors and foreign business actors, especially those carried out electronically. As an effort to minimize the tax burden of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises (UMKM), the Government continues to make improvements by establishing various policies contained in the Minister of Finance Regulation (PMK) (Asadi et al., 2022).  The existence of tax incentives for UMKM can increase J.D.H. Vol. 23 (No. 2): 1-21 | DOI: 10.20884/1.jdh.%Y.%v.%i.3474 [18]  the number of taxpayers who make tax payments. This indicates that tax incentive policies can improve tax compliance (Putra & Supartini, 2019). The positive response of taxpayers to the incentive policy prompted the government to issue a policy of adjusting economic conditions. One of the policies issued is Law Number 7 of 2021 concerning Harmonization of Tax Regulations (HPP Law) (Mohklas et al., 2022) which was passed by the government on October 29, 2021. Quoting from the official website of the DJP, the HPP Law also regulates the principles and objectives. The HPP Law is organized based on the principles of justice, simplicity, efficiency, legal compliance, expediency, and national interest (Nurillah & Andini, 2022).  Meanwhile, the purpose of the preparation of the HPP Law is to increase sustainable economic growth and support the acceleration of economic recovery during the Covid-19 pandemic. The HPP Law contains six amendment clauses, namely General Provisions and Tax Procedures (KUP), Income Tax (PPh), Value Added Tax (VAT), Carbon Tax, Voluntary Disclosure Program, and Excise Law (Rahmadi & Wahyudi, 2022).  These six amendment clauses were enacted at different times.  Conclusion  Based on the description of the theoretical review and discussion of the material discussed above, it can be concluded that: 1. The tax policy in the form of lowering the corporate income tax rate and the imposition of taxes on trade in goods and/or services through an electronic system is contained in Perppu Number 1 of 2020 jo Law Number 2 of 2020. The tax policy carries 4 aspects of objectives in the context of ease of doing business for national economic resilience and growth: a) Increasing investment funding b) Encouraging voluntary compliance of taxpayers and payers c) Increasing legal certainty, and d) Creating an equal business environment in the country.  2. The regular function of the tax that can organize and strengthen the national economy, works through changes to the provisions of the tax cluster of the Job Creation Act and Perppu Number 1 of 2020 Jo. Law No. 2 of 2020 by: a) Incentives for taxation on dividends from within the country and not imposing income tax on dividends and after-tax profits from abroad, lower income tax rates on interest, or other income from abroad will be an Legal Aspects Of Taxation...  Yulianto Syahyu  [19] attraction for direct investment from abroad in Indonesia. Additionally, it was done to boost the domestic economy. b) Legal certainty in the form of rules for affirming the status of tax subjects, namely for Indonesian citizens staying in Indonesia up to 183 days in 12 months and foreigners who are in Indonesia for more than 183 days in 12 months, so as not to cause differences in interpretation. In addition, there are arrangements that are expected to attract foreigners with special skills (expatriate) to work in Indonesia, only subject to tax on income originating in Indonesia (not on all income). c) Arrangement (relaxation) of input tax crediting provisions. Input Tax crediting rights are now granted for expenses related to business activities and the VAT has been paid. Sanctions from the tax administration are also mentioned in the provisions. d) Arrangements on the amount of administrative sanctions of interest and interest rewards are applied by taking into account market interest rates, aiming to provide fairness and encourage voluntary compliance. e) Taxation of digital transactions carried out by foreign sellers or marketplaces is an effort to enforce the taxation rights of the Indonesian state and to ensure equal tax treatment between domestic business actors and foreign business actors, especially those conducted electronically.  Suggestion  It is undeniable that currently the Taxation sector is the largest source of income and state expenditure financing. It applies to both routine expenditures and development costs as shown in the State Budget (APBN) in recent years. As a result, having a tax agency with tax institutions (Director General of Taxes and staff) is very strategic. Furthermore, it is necessary for the government to organize the taxation institutions, where the institutions that function as instruments for seeking and sources of state finances, such as the Director General of Taxes and the Director General of Customs and Excise and other similar institutions, become one entity, where the agency is independent, not under the Ministry of Finance. It is hoped that with the arrangement of taxation institutions and other similar institutions, state revenues from the taxation sector can be utilized as much as possible for national economic resilience and growth.
