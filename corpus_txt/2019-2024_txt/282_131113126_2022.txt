His rise to power brought about not just a new era in Argentine political history, but also resulted in the emergence of one of the longest lasting political movements in the world: Peronismo, or Peronism. Since its inception, it has been the salient driving force within the realm of Argentine politics for the better part of seven decades; indeed, since 1946, the Peronists have won 10 of the 13 presidential elections in which they have been allowed to run. This includes the current president of Argentina, Alberto Ángel Fernández, who was elected in 2019; and for better or for worse, Fernández’s presidency will be demarcated by the advent of the Coronavirus pandemic, which became an international crisis mere months after his inauguration.  Much like Peronism’s influence on Argentina, COVID-19 has continued to shape and define the world since its initial global proliferation. In many ways, its impact has been macabre, yet strangely poetic. Almost a century after the 1918 influenza outbreak which took the lives of millions across the world, the ramifications of the Coronavirus pandemic – like the Spanish Flu – have reverberated across the world, changing the course of international policies in perpetuity. The global growth of 2020 was projected at –4.9 percent; and while updated forecasts suggest that global growth in 2021 will be around 5.9%, such projections fail to take into account factors such as unemployment, inflation, and debt, all of which have gone up across the world since the beginning of the pandemic (IMF 2022). And while the entire world may have been devastated by its emergence, some countries have been hit harder than others. Argentina – after two straight years of economic decline and a GDP growth rate in 2019 (the year before COVID-19) of -2.09% – suffered a decline in GDP of -16.2% in the second quarter of 2020 alone (Macrotrends  3 2021; The Economist 2021). Even as its initial response to mitigating COVID had been touted as being “the best choice among bad alternatives,” COVID’s continued resilience has highlighted the Peronist government’s inability to act quickly and decisively to react to changing times (Bremmer 2021).  But how have countries with differing ideologies responded differently to the same pandemic? Among developed countries, the United States’ response has widely been criticized as being inept and ineffective; as of February of 2022, the number of deaths caused by COVID was over 953,000, around 16% of total deaths attributed to the pandemic worldwide (CDC 2020). There is not a singular reason as to why the United States failed to properly respond; rather, it was a cacophony of miscalculations, underestimations, and ignorance. The social policy response was lackluster. While the rounds of stimulus checks did help alleviate the financial burden felt by families across the country, it was too little, too late (Aaron 2020). The monetary handouts did provide some semblance of relief for cash-strapped families; but in many ways, it was regressive, as the lump sum disproportionately helped the rich more than the poor (Peter G. Peterson Foundation 2022). For the rich, the handout resulted in an increase in liquidity. But for the poor, it provided little support in paying bills, hospital fees, and other such necessities.  On the other end of the spectrum, nations like New Zealand have been lauded as having the best approach to the pandemic. Not only did their government enact an all-in approach with regards to testing and vaccinating, they successfully implemented “social welfare and worker supports [and] economic [stimuli]”; moreover, the nation’s 2020 budget provided additional funding for “wage subsidies, support for loans… and support for workers” (Dyer 2021). It becomes clear that New Zealand’s economic response to the pandemic differed vastly from the policies of both the United States and Argentina for a variety of reasons. First, whereas the U.S.  4 response was decentralized and disorganized at a national level, New Zealand’s national government swiftly imposed restrictions for the entire country and superseded state-level authorities. Second, there was a concerted nationwide effort to provide financial support for workers and employees, the same which cannot be said about the United States. And third, while the majority of Argentina’s COVID related mandates – as well as a plurality of The United States’ – came in the form of executive orders, this was not the case in New Zealand. While such disparities in responses can be a resultant of multiple factors, it can reasonably be assumed that these economic policies are shaped by each respective nation’s ideological orientation and their coalitions of support. While Argentina might not be unique in its failures to reverse the harms brought about as a result of the prolonged pandemic, it certainly ought not rest on its laurels; other nations around the world have proven that it is entirely possible to address the same concerns much more effectively. For instance, neighboring Chile was quick to implement – among other policies – nationwide vaccination programs; as a result, it was able to turn one of the worst outbreaks in the world into a symbol of success (Noori Farzan 2021). But with inflation at over 50% and unemployment at historic levels, the question remains, what part has Argentina’s Peronist coalition played in the gross ineptitude of the nation’s response? Why has it failed where others have succeeded? In the nearly 75 years since the emergence of Peronism in Argentina, the country has gone through bouts of nationwide defaults, debt crises, and debilitating economic turmoil. But is the link between national economic failure and the prevalence of Peronism a correlation, or a causation? And if it is the latter, how can these failures be conceptualized through a Peronist lens?   5 Research Question This thesis seeks to understand the impact of Peronism – and the Peronist coalition – on the policy choices made by the Argentine government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Peronist economic policies were implemented to stimulate the recovery of Argentina during the COVID-19 pandemic. Often described as a “vague blend of nationalism and laborism,” Peronism has remained salient in the realm of Argentine politics since the days of Juan Domingo Perón himself. In this sense, Peronism as a movement is incredibly unique – and inherently contradictory. It has been both right-wing and left-wing. It has been both nationalist and inter-nationalist. It has been both protectionist and neoliberal. So how can one define the tenets and objectives of Peronist economic policy, and how can that be interpreted within the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic? The question this thesis will seek to answer is the following: “How have Argentina’s Peronist coalitions of support shaped the country’s economic response to COVID-19 (i.e., tax hikes, cash transfer programs, rent freezes)?” It appears as though every country has had a different reaction to the onset of the Coronavirus. But in what ways has Argentina’s response differed as a result of its Peronist past, and how has that change been manifested through salient economic policy?  In short, I want to explain how the independent variable – in this case the Peronist influences on the makeup of the coalitions of support – has affected the dependent variable – the economic policies implemented in response to COVID-19. This thesis will look specifically at the policies and laws passed between March of 2020 and March of 2021; the rationale behind the starting date is due to the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic – for all intents and purposes – truly became a global crisis in March of 2020. It must be noted, however, that the purpose of this thesis is not to analyze the traditions of Peronism in Argentina; this is due to the fact that a study  6 of this nature would largely be tautological, as past policies shape future policies more so than any other factor. In looking at history and changes of the Peronist coalition of support, however, it becomes possible to conceptualize the question at hand.  Research Design and Methodology  In order to address the question of how Peronist coalitions have impacted Argentina’s economic response to COVID, I first seek to define the various characteristics of Peronist coalitions of support starting from its historical roots in the burgeoning years of Perón’s presidency and working chronologically throughout its nearly eight decade-long history, ending with an analysis of the most recent iteration of the Peronist electoral alliance. Next, I conduct an in-depth study into the various economic policies passed during the Coronavirus pandemic between March 2020-March 2022 in Argentina. Once I have accumulated enough information regarding these policies, I compare them to similar policies from neighboring Chile. Finally, I conclude my thesis with an exploration of alternative hypotheses, various possible externalities, and exigent circumstances that might have played a role in the differences between the respective nations’ policy formation, while also discussing potential avenues of research for the future. To that end, my thesis will consist of five, distinct sections. First will be the review of current literature, which will provide the contextualization of Peronism, its economic policies, and its evolution over the course of history. Included within this section will be a comprehensive overview of Peronist traditions, a breakdown of the various economic, political, and social actors that make up each of the coalitions, as well as a look into the similarities and differences between coalitions over time. In elucidating the parameters of Peronism, a relatively clear and concise definition can be formed. This will then be used as the benchmark for analysis for later chapters,  7 as it will allow for easier identification of the Peronist undertones in the new economic policies developed during the identified time period as it relates to COVID-19.  To facilitate this, I will use primary sources consisting of the Argentine Congressional repository (https://www.hcdn.gob.ar/ for the Chamber of Deputies and https://www.senado.gob.ar/ for the Argentine Senate), the official bulletin of the Republic of Argentina (wherein the executive branch uploads its various mandates and decrees), and newspaper articles. I will look to two specific newspapers, La Nación and Página/12, for information pertaining to specifically tax hikes, cash transfer programs, and rent freezes passed between March of 2020 to March of 2022. The rationale for choosing these specific newspapers is due to the fact that their political leanings are diametrically opposed. Whereas the new owner of Página/12 has openly admitted to continuing the Kirchnerist ties of his newspaper (making it the voice of the left, or at the very least, those in support of Kirchnerism), La Nación has been the voice of conservatism for well over 100 years (Ziblat 2016; Ares 1985). Having these starkly opposing viewpoints will allow for some semblance of objectivity when conducting analyses of the policies at hand. There are a few different reasons as to why Chile was selected as the comparative study. First, both Chile and Argentina are relatively wealthy nations located in the Southern Cone; Argentina’s nominal GDP (in USD) in 2020 was ranked 3rd in Latin America at $382.8 billion, while Chile ranks 5th at $245.4 billion (Macrotrends 2021). Second, both were former viceroyalties of the former Spanish Empire, with Argentina being a part of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and Chile being a part of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Moreover, both nations have had similar historical roots. Third, both Argentina and Chile have had a penchant of getting involved with dictatorial regimes; Argentina has suffered through numerous military coups in the  8 second half of the 20th century, while the politics of Chile are most widely recognized for the regime of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990). In addition to this, both countries were hit hard by the Coronavirus pandemic.  There are, however, important differences that exist between these two countries. While they both have had their fair share of dictators, wars, successes, and failures, Chile has often been rated as one of the most democratic states in the entirety of Latin America, with The Economist giving it a rating of 8.28/10.00 (The Economist 2021). This makes Chile a “full democracy;” furthermore, it ranks as the 2nd more democratic state in the region and the 17th most democratic state in the world. By way of comparison, Argentina has a ranking of 6.95/10.00, a global ranking of 48th, and is typified as a “flawed democracy.” Another difference is the fact that since its democratization, Chile has remained consistent with the types of liberal economic policies it has implemented; in contrast, the economic policies of Argentina have gone through crests and troughs with respect to the types of ideologies to which they adhere (i.e., neoliberalism of the 1990s with Menem, heterodox policies of the 2000s, and the return to more conservative ideals with Macri from 2015-2019).  By comparing these two nations that are geographically similar yet politically different, it will become possible to compare and contrast the policies of Argentina and of Chile and conceptualize the disparities. This comparative study will allow me to identify the Peronist elements of the specific policies of Argentina by isolating the differences between the two.   9 Chapter 1. Literature Review: The Peronist Contradiction In order to understand the impact of Peronist coalitions on Argentina’s recovery from the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic, one must understand and be able to conceptualize the historic roots of Peronism itself. More specifically, an in-depth understanding of Peronist economics – as well as its historical composition – is imperative in being able to identify examples of its continued salience in a modern context.  Peronism first took control of the political landscape of Argentina with the election of Juan Perón in 1946; since then, the nation has seen multitudes of iterations, variations, and regimes that have helped to shape the course of the nation throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Its history can be divided into 5 different periods: 1946-1955 (Juan Perón’s first two terms), 1973-1976 (Perón’s third term, as well as the subsequent term of his wife Isabel), 1989-1999 (the period of Menemism), 2000-2003 (the Duhalde period), and finally, the periods between 2003-2015 as well as 2019-Present (the Kirchner and Fernández administrations).  Peronism during the time of the eponymous president can be seen as both a rejection – and the amalgamation – of political ideologies of the past. In a speech given on the 20th of August 1948, Perón claims that his new political ideology is: humanism in action; Peronism is a new political doctrine, which rejects all the ills of the politics of previous times… in the economic sphere its aim is that every Argentine should pull his weight for the Argentines and that economic policy which maintained that this was a permanent and perfect school of capitalist exploitation should be replaced by a doctrine of social economy under which the distribution of our wealth, which we force the earth to yield up to us and which furthermore we are elaborating, may be shared out fairly among all those who have contributed by their efforts to amass it.” (Perón 1950)  He espoused the three main tenets of his new political brand, the three “pillars” that would loosely define – and oftentimes paradoxically contrast – its existence for decades: political sovereignty, economic independence, and social justice (1950). In short, it was a new political  10 movement with a powerful demagogue at its helm, with influences from both the ideological left and the right. It was more than just an ideology; in contrast to the various different political ideologies found across the world, Peronism can be conceptualized by its fluidity and its ability to adapt and change. In fact, it appeared as though Perón himself embraced this, declaring in 1951 that “the masses don’t think, the masses feel and they have more or less intuitive and organized reactions. Who produces those reactions? Their leader” (1950). This is a key factor in the longevity of the Partido Justicialista, the main Peronist political party founded by Juan Domingo Perón himself. Because “winning public office is a primary goal of most parties, their strategies tend to be shaped by the structure of the electorate and party system” (Levitsky 2011, 30). In this sense, parties that are not able to constantly adapt to its surroundings find themselves in a rapid state of decline. Perón himself sought to implement social programs to empower and benefit the working class, while supporting the labor unions and industrialists at the same time; in doing so, Perón had built the foundations of his party coalition.  The first iteration of the Peronist coalition was spearheaded by the triumvirate of labor unions, industrialists, and the working class; however, this burgeoning sociopolitical alliance merits further analysis of its own. Peronist Argentina during the eponymous president’s first two terms was a labor-based economy, meaning the labor force was viewed as an essential component within the process of production. To that end, the organization of labor unions played a critical role in shaping the policies of the Perón administrations. Before his ascendence to the presidency in 1946, Perón served in the military government (established as a result of the coup d’état in 1943) as the Secretary of Labor; but this military administration did little to aid the unions, and in fact, adopted a number of “repressive-type labor” policies to weaken said unions. After 1946, however, the mutual relationship between the Peronists and the unions forced the  11 administration to abandon such policies and implement “a battery of political and economic measures” to strengthen the labor organizations (Gerchunoff 1989, 64). Such policies include redistributive measures to increase nominal wages of workers within the various trade unions (although real wages did not increase at a commensurate rate).  The second main sociopolitical sector – that of the domestic industrialists – also benefited heavily as a result of the Peronist presidency. It is no secret that Perón’s policies were often influenced by his xenophobic nationalist Italian idol, Benito Mussolini. And from the beginning, Peronism was seen as being less open to “foreign capital and trade,” as the eponymous leader’s ideology certainly reflected an aura of nationalism (Di Tella and Dubra 2017, 6). It must be reiterated, however, that Peronism is not at all synonymous with nationalism; it is more fluid than what the parameters of a singular ideology has to offer. For instance, while it is generally accepted that Peronism is left-of-center, studies have indicated that “the biggest proportion of believers in laziness as a source of poverty take place amongst Peronists and [American] Republicans” (5). But this xenophobic and nationalistic attitude worked to the advantage of domestic industrialists, as “the use of protective tariffs allowed [domestic] industries to operate” more profitably with complete disregard for foreign competition (Gerchunoff 60). Other policies such as ISI (Import Substitution Industrialization) flourished during this time period as well, which will be further discussed in later. The final sector within the first Peronist coalition – then – was comprised of the common people: the blue-collar workers and the “public employees” (Murillo and Zarazaga 2020, 128). In this regard, Peronist coalitions are “mass” coalitions, political alliances that are partially developed around and mobilized by the types of citizens indicated above. Since its inception, the Peronist coalition has been the coalition of the people; Perón himself not only implemented  12 “policies that directly supported labor,” but was also responsible for establishing a variety of “social programs in different areas… ranging from increased access to free health care, to the creation of a comprehensive housing program” (Di Tella and Dubra 2017, 7). In fact, Peronist coalitions’ rapport with the marginalized and poor goes back to its roots; one of the 20 basic tenets of the ideology states that “no Peronist should feel that he is more than he is, nor less than he should be. when a Peronist begins to feel that he is more than he is, he begins to change into an oligarch” (Perón 1950). For the disenfranchised Argentines, Perón was their champion, the leader whose rhetoric would galvanize them to action. The same can be said about the principles of Peronist economic policies. Pablo Gerchunoff posits that one of the focal points of Peronist economic theory during the Perón presidency was the undertaking of the creation of “an alliance of urban social sectors aimed at establishing a semi-closed growth strategy” (Gerchunoff 1989, 60). In combining protectionist measures – such as tariffs, subsidies, and “the nationalization of foreign trade” – with more capitalistic ones – such as investments made into the agricultural sector – allowed for Perón to focus on the internal growth and development of his national economy, while ensuring that the inflow of foreign capital (which his administration totally controlled) would be monitored and molded to his liking (66). In essence, Peronist economics – much like the tenets of Peronism itself – is both protectionist and nationalist. Even virulent anti-Peronist government officials implemented policies pertaining to those of the Perón government. Raúl Prebisch, an Argentine economist most widely recognized for his development of the theory of Import-Substitution Industrialization (ISI), became the special economic advisor to the new military regime after the successful coup against President Perón. ISI was an economic theory that promoted the protection of growing domestic industries within developing economies so as to decrease the  13 nation’s dependence on foreign trade; in doing so, acolytes of ISI theory believed that the process would strengthen domestic economies and make their nations self-sufficient. To accomplish this, a variety of measures could be taken into effect, include the aforementioned tariffs, subsidies, and more. It was an economic theory that was insular, protectionist, and – for all intents and purposes – Peronist.  What is peculiar, however, is that the policies that Prebisch helped to implement were not at all in line with his work in the past; in fact, it appeared as though Prebisch suffered from a “’Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde’ complex” with respect to his implemented policies as economic advisor (Sikkink 1988, 95). Whereas he advised the new military regime to reverse the relative prices of agricultural goods so as to “expand exports and thus generate the foreign exchange necessary for capital goods to support continued industrialization”, he was also the creator of the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis, a proposition that “net barter terms of trade between primary products and manufactures have been subject to a long-run downward trend” (1988, 96; J. Toye and R. Toye 2003, 437). It is important to note that the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis served as the basis for the implementation of ISI in Latin American nations, including Perón’s Argentina. The totality of Peronism during this time was predicated upon flexibility, the strengthening of national identity, and the protection of its accumulated power (both political and economic). This means that while other political parties might have been criticized and castigated for the implementation of policies that were in stark contrast to their campaign platforms, Peronist coalitions did not suffer from the same shortcoming; as the populist labor party of the time of Perón, it received immense levels of support from large swathes of the Argentine people. And until the 1980s, the Peronist party was the de facto labor party within the country, consisting of mostly labor unions and members of the middle and working classes.   14 But a byproduct of its ideological fluidity, adaptability, and resiliency is the fact that the Peronist coalition is constantly evolving to retain its hold on the nation’s politics; to that end, it has changed remarkably since its creation. While the movement may have its roots in laborism (i.e., support of labor and trade unions), the 1980s brought forth an overhaul of the ideological and coalitional structures of the party itself, representing an evolution of both the economics and politics of Peronism. With the ousting of the military dictatorship in 1983, “labor [as a driving force] lost influence vis-à-vis the newly elected governors and mayors. At this point, Peronism turned into a political force based upon extended clientelistic networks” (Gambini 1999). Within the decade of the 1980s, the Peronist coalition transmogrified from the “de facto labor party into a predominantly patronage-based party” (Levitsky 2003, 107). In doing so, the robust organizational structure was overhauled and recreated, with the new patronage networks replacing the labor unions as its main link to its voting populus. With the reconstitution of the coalition structure came a new president, the neoliberal Carlos Menem. In sharp contrast to Perón’s party, Menem took advantage of the “weakly institutionalized nature” of the party and  “facilitated the removal of old-guard leaders and permitted the entry and rise of new blood into the party leadership” (3). He removed the labor union as his linkage to the people, and instead opted to fortify the local, provincial, and national structure of the Peronists to reach the entirety of the nation.  President Carlos Menem had – in short – reconstituted his party’s support base without changing the party’s ultimate goal of retaining power by limiting the influence of the labor unions, which acted as intermediaries between the party and the people. But many core components of the Peronist political alliance had remained the same. As previously stated, the first iteration of the Peronist party coalition consisted mainly of labor unions, industrialists, and  15 the working class. With the exception of the unions (and more specifically, union leadership), these sections had – by and large – stayed within the Peronist electoral constituency; in fact, Peronism’s close ties to domestic industries (as well as organized labor as a whole) were seen as “obstacles” during the wave of liberal reforms that occurred in the mid to late 1980s in Argentina (Levitsky 2001, 28). In its stead, patronage grew in prominence, as the newly formed networks “provided social protection [for the urban working class] through clientelism” (Tekiner 2020, 273). Another sector that aided the Peronists in maintaining political dominance during this time of sociopolitical upheaval was the alliance made up of the various provincial governors within Argentina. Between the 1983 and 1999 general elections, Peronists had constituted over 50% of the total number of governors in every election, with some years as high as 73.9% (Calvo and Murillo 2004, 746). Moreover, while opposition victories in gubernatorial elections ranged from “two to seven… those of the Peronists ranged from 12 to 17” (747). This remarkable level of gubernatorial continuity had been (and continues to be) instrumental in the Peronist coalitions’ success, as the ideological homogeneity had allowed for the people involved to reap the benefits of patronage for decades. But what would these governors be without the very people that voted for them? The Peronists were no longer the champions of the people; instead, they were now the leaders of the political machine. This remains true to this day, as modern-day Peronist coalitions (including the current president, who served as the Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers to Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, who in turn was First Lady to Néstor Kirchner, who ruled from 2003 to 2007) are more reminiscent of a patronage-based alliance made up of clientelistic party machines that dictate the ebb and flow of the party’s linkages to the voting population. The Peronist coalitions of Menem were not entirely devoid of popular support from the masses; but an  16 analysis of actions taken by his administration in the waxing years of the 1990s provide evidence that would suggest otherwise. The economic crisis of the 1980s was international in its scope; however, it impacted the developing nations of Latin America particularly badly. 1989 had the highest rates of inflation in Argentina’s history. In addition to this, 1989 was also the year “in which the deficit peaked” (Buera, Navarro, and Nicolini 2011, 145). This was the political climate into which Peronist president Carlos Menem was thrust. In order to combat the rampant levels of hyperinflation and general economic catastrophe, President Menem implemented “profound reforms” that were – for the most part – in stark contrast to the tenets of the “traditional constituency of the Peronist party” (Bambaci, Saront, and Tommasi 2002, 75). His policies could be described as being neoliberal; some of his macroeconomic policies were reminiscent of the “Washington Consensus,” as they brought about a wave of privatization and financial liberalization (76). It was during this time that YPF – one of the world’s largest energy companies – was privatized, a move which would later be reversed during the Cristina Kirchner administration decades later (Gallegos 2013). By this point, it becomes clear that Menem represented a complete departure from his predecessors; his presidency was a cacophony of policies aimed at privatizing and neo-liberalizing a nation under immense economic duress, hyperinflation, and popular dissent. But not only did Menem’s policies during the decade of the 1990s starkly contrast the tenets of Peronism up until this point, they also had a profound – and catastrophic – impact on the future of Argentina, an issue that can only be elucidated within the context of Menemist – and Peronist – economics First and foremost, the economic policies passed by the Menem administration inflated the real value of the Argentine currency (at this point in time, the Austral, and later, the  17 Argentine Peso). With a fixed rate of exchange to the U.S. dollar, any fluctuations in the price of the dollar had massive ramifications across the entirety of the economy (Setser and Gelpern 2006, 466). Second and relatedly, the fixed exchange rate meant that domestic financial contracts were often conducted in U.S. dollars. This, coupled with an appreciating U.S. dollar of the late 1990s and falling prices of commodities across the world, meant that Argentina's competitiveness in international markets was severely limited as the strong domestic currency hurts exports from the country. Finally, the currency convertibility system (responsible for pegging the Argentine currency to the U.S.) devolved into yet another “organizing device” to be used by political actors of the nation for their own purposes (466). The problem was not the fixed-rate convertibility, however. As a point of comparison, Hong Kong adopted similar convertibility measures, but was able to avoid a financial meltdown in the midst of the broader Asian financial crisis of 1997 (Carson and Clark 2013). The problem, then, was the instability and fragility of the domestic financial institutions that governed the economy of the nation. And it was the failure of Menem to properly redress and remediate the adverse impacts of the 1989 financial crisis that led to the Argentine “Great Depression” of 2001. This financial crisis came as a surprise to no one; in fact, it was the culmination of decades of stagnation and poor policymaking. Thanks in due part to Argentina’s dependence on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for external financing – combined with the nation’s inability to pay back these debts – the country found itself in both a domestic and external sovereign debt crisis, resulting in rampant levels of poverty and unemployment (Setser and Gelpern 2006, 470). It was within this context that Peronism went through yet another transformation in the burgeoning years of the 21st century.   18 However, this new “form” of Peronism was not so much another iteration, but rather, a derivation of it. Referred to as Kirchnerism (named after Argentine presidents Néstor Kirchner and Cristina Fernández de Kirchner), this new ideology has come to dominate the scope of Argentine politics since the election of Néstor Kirchner in 2003, whose political ideology is oftentimes classified as being a socialist form of Peronism (Levitsky 2011, 285). Moreover, it deviates from the pragmatic, fluid nature of Peronism; instead, Kirchnerism is more dogmatic, left-wing populist, and staunchly anti-neoliberal. Néstor Kirchner was initially elected under the PJ platform; once in office, however, his rhetoric became more and more critical of his Peronist predecessors. Namely, the Kirchner administration sharply criticized the market-oriented reforms of the (neoliberal) opponent Carlos Menem.  This highlights the stubborn rigidity of this new ideology, as well as the differences in the makeup of the coalitions; whereas traditional Peronists were willing to adapt and change to extenuating circumstances for the survival of the party as a whole (as demonstrated by its radical transformation from a pro-labor to a “patronage-oriented machine party”), Kirchnerism relied on rallying radical popular support from the masses to sustain its continued existence. Whereas Peronism had historically been anti-socialist (and anti-capitalist), Kirchnerism can be viewed as a left-wing interpretation of Peronism. It heavily relied on the manipulation and obfuscation of regulatory and macroeconomic policies to achieve its goals. Kirchner even went so far as to vilify the IMF, blaming the organization for the economic crisis that had destroyed much of the nation’s economy in the early years of the 21st century (289). But despite its differences, the composition of social, economic, and political actors who make up the current Kirchnerist coalition bears a large resemblance to the coalitions of the past. A high-level overview reveals that the Kirchnerist alliance – much like its historical counterparts – is comprised of labor  19 unions, domestic industrialist, Peronist governors, and the blue-collar Argentine working class. But unlike the Peronist coalitions during the days of Perón, the Kirchnerist administrations have also received tremendous support from the workers within the informal sector; this meant that – in addition to the blue-collar Argentine worker – the demographic of popular support now included “the unemployed and slum dwellers” (Murillo and Zarazaga 2020, 128).  This new addition to the stratum of the working-class constituency is incredibly significant for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, their mere existence and continued growth is a result of the economic turmoil of the early 1990s and 2000s during the presidency of Carlos Menem. His precipitous failures to reign in foreign debt and rampant inflation resulted in the destruction of the Argentine economy, in addition to the loss of thousands of jobs across the country. With no magical reversal of fortunes in sight, many Argentines turned to the informal labor sector, finding employment in whatever form they could for hopes of achieving financial survival. As Néstor’s platform grew to be increasingly anti-Menem and anti-neoliberal, he found a broad and fervent base of support from this growing (both in size and discontent) population of the working class. Second and relatedly, the addition of the informal sector is significant due to the sheer number of individuals it constitutes. By 2003, the percentage of non-registered wage earners in Argentina rose to 41% of the total waged labor force, up from 29% in 1993 (Beccaria and Groisman 2016, 124). While indicative of the underdevelopment of Argentina’s economy in a modern context, the growth in the informal sector – as well as its eventual organization – highlights the strength of Peronist sociopolitical alliances; in bringing together the marginalized workers in Argentine society together under one coalition, Kirchner was able to resolidify a constituency that had lost faith in governmental institutions following the economic turmoil of the 90s and 2000s.   20 To rectify and reverse the detrimental effects had by the 2001 Argentine financial crisis, the Kirchner administration enacted a cacophony of populist and protectionist policies that drew the ire of many organizations and groups across the country. This was done through three general initiatives. First was the implementation of price controls and export quotas on products such as gasoline, milk, beef, and agricultural goods. Second, the administration put into place price controls on public utilities such as water, electricity, and communication systems. Finally, they provided subsidies to businessmen working in industries such as energy, transport, and food production. All in all, these measures sought to “protect popular sectors’ short-run income” (Levitsky 2011, 291). These policies alienated large swathes of the country, especially those directly involved in the agricultural and gas industries. But in spite of the venomous rhetoric espoused against capitalism and neoliberalism, the Kirchner administrations (Néstor Kircher from 2003-2007, Cristina Kirchner from 2007-2015) did surprisingly little to reverse the privatization (linked to the neoliberal policies of the Menem administration) of the 1990s, with only a small amount of re-nationalization of key sectors such as the postal service, telecommunications, and pensions (Manzetti 2016). And with the Peronist ideological split that occurred in 2015 notwithstanding (a split which resulted in the election of conservative Mauricio Macri to the presidency), the support of the common people remained strong. Regardless of whether they voted for the more conservative wing or the more liberal one, the Peronist coalition was ultimately able to bridge this gap; and in 2019, the Fernández-Kirchner alliance came into power. So how can Kirchnerism be contextualized within the broader scope of Peronism? And would it be acceptable – and accurate – to classify Kirchnerism as a form of Peronism, or should it be classified as something else entirely? An argument can be made that despite the numerous  21 differences, Kirchnerism and Peronism, as well as the more neoliberal Menemism, are more closely aligned than they appear at face value. Argentina’s long history with Peronist ideologies and ideals has led some scholars to typify it as a “Peronist democracy,” as opposed to a delegative or a hyper-presidential one (Tekiner 2020, 258). Following the same logic, then, the Menem administration can be labeled as “Peronist neoliberalism,” and the Kirchner administrations as “Peronist socialism.” The fluidity of the Peronist coalitional structure has allowed for its makeup to remain fairly constant, regardless of the ideological changes that have taken place within the past seven decades. But not only are the coalitions throughout history similar with regards to composition, they – not shockingly – also have very similar policy orientations. Just like how Perón espoused the important of social programs to uplift the marginalized Argentines during the 1950s, the same was done in wake of the 2001 financial crisis by the Duhalde administration, wherein conditional cash transfer programs were implemented to alleviate the financial burden placed upon the populus (Galasso and Ravallion 2004, 370). Just like Perón’s use of government intervention in lieu of more internationalism, the new Fernández presidency has placed an emphasis on “political sovereignty [and] economic independence” (Tekiner 2020, 258). This continuity within policy is yet another example of the continuation of Peronist traditions through its various coalitions; and it is this continuity that allows for the comparative analysis of economic policies between crises, presidencies, and coalitions throughout history. But what exactly are Peronist economic policies, and how can they be contextualized within Argentina’s history? In terms of Peronist economics, the evolution of the party constitution seems to have no causal effect. And neither the waxing of patronage nor the waning of laborism changed the inherent problem at hand, that of Argentina’s gradual – yet recognizable  22 – stagnation. Rafael Di Tella and Juan Dubra affirm the Díaz Alejandro hypothesis, which blames Argentina’s “relative decline to the replacement of the export-oriented, market friendly policies of the early 1900s by populist, interventionist policies around the time of the great depression” (Di Tella and Dubra 2017, 6). They point to the time around the election of Juan Domingo Perón as the start of the period of “early retardation” of the Argentine economy, a trend which continues (albeit with crests and troughs) to this day. According to Di Tella and Dubra, Peronist economics is predicated upon Argentina’s long history of interventionism and populism and is – in short – a type of crony capitalism that was one of the main causes of the “retardation” of the nation’s growth starting in the middle of the 20th century (6). Crony capitalism is defined as “enterprises which depend on the state´s benevolence to be allowed to import raw material or other inputs, to win contracts for public works, to be allowed to export…” (Beker 2016, 4). In essence, crony capitalism – the system that most resembles Argentina’s economic system – ensures that businessmen “spend more time in public offices dealing with paperwork and lobbying than in their production plants” (4). In 2014, the English newspaper The Economist set out to define and delineate the extent of crony-capitalist countries in the world; to that end, they created what is now known as the crony-capitalism index in order to highlight their findings. By seeking to calculate the number of economic rent-seekers in ten industries highly susceptible to monopolization and corruption (those being casinos, coal, palm oil and timber production, national defense, investment banking, infrastructure and pipelines, ports, airports, real estate and construction, steel and metal production, mining and commodities, and telecoms services), The Economist created an easily quantifiable metric to compare one country to another (The Economist 2021). To no surprise, the top of the chart is dominated by Russia; ten spots  23 down at number 11, however, is Argentina, with over 70% of its wealth coming in the form of crony-capitalist policies and institutions. Through this, a (relatively) concise definition of Peronist economics can be formulated. Peronist economic policy is, then, a form of crony capitalism that has its origins in both populist and nationalist rhetoric. It employs both protectionist strategies (such as ISI), and more liberal ones. But going beyond the rational discourses on economic policies coming from both Peronist and anti-Peronists, Peronism has “a marked social-cultural component” which allows for political diatribe to happen “at a visceral level” (Ostiguy 1997, 37). In this context, it is impossible to separate the politics from the policy. Peronism is more than just an ideology – it is a “flexible… brand” (Calvo and Murillo 2012, 148). It emphasizes the retention of power and national dominance. It is focused on the ultimate goal: survival. For the Peronist brand to survive, it has to constantly change and adapt, and will not let any rival faction (or individual) get in its way. It is important to bear this fact in mind as one continues to analyze the impact of Peronism on the Argentine economy; Peronism often supersedes policies and politics. Nobel laureate and famed economist Simon Kuznets was once to have said that there are four types of countries in the world: “the developed, the underdeveloped, Japan, and Argentina” (Saiegh 1996, 3). Indeed, as seen in the literature above, the history of Argentina’s economy since 1946 has been mired with periods of time that seem to starkly contrast one another in every capacity. The first Peronist period of 1946-1955 was dominated by Perón himself, whose populist and quasi-fascist leadership galvanized much of the lower and middle-class population in Argentina. The subsequent period until 1973 saw a complete and utter rejection of Peronism as a whole, with the movement being banned outright by the ensuing military junta. Perón’s third term – coupled with his wife’s tenure after his death – followed closely after the successful  24 neoliberal coup d’état of General Augusto Pinochet in neighboring Chile and was demarcated by increasing turmoil within the right- and left-wing factions within the Peronist movement. The coup on Isabel Perón’s regime in 1976 preceded what is now known as the “Dirty War,” a period of state-sanctioned terrorism where thousands of political dissidents (mostly communists and left-wing Peronists) were murdered or “disappeared” by military death squads (BA Times 2021b). The presidency of Carlos Menem from 1989 to 1999 deviated substantially from the original tenets of Peronism, as it appeared to adhere to the values of neoliberalism more so than any other economic ideology. And after the economic collapse in 2001 during the presidencies of Fernando de la Rúa and Eduardo Duhalde came the final – and most current – iteration of Peronism, the presidencies of the Néstor and Cristina Kirchner.  Not only does Peronism have a rich, convoluted history that has ingratiated itself within Argentina’s political climate, it continues to have a salient effect to this day. Conceptualizing Peronist economics through the lens of past economic crises provides for an excellent starting point for a study on the current crisis at hand. And by understanding the interplay between the economic and political tenets of this ideology – as well as its evolution throughout the course of the past few decades – it then becomes possible to apply the same principles to the context at hand in a comparative policy analysis.    25 Chapter 2: Description and Analysis of Peronist/Kirchnerist Electoral Coalitions of Support  2a. Introduction The 2021 midterm elections in Argentina proved to be devastating for the Fernández administration, as the Kirchnerist Frente de Todos coalition suffered setbacks in every corner of the nation of Argentina. In contrast to the center right Juntos por el Cambio (JxC) coalition which garnered 40.1% of votes in the Buenos Aires province, Fernández’s Frente de Todos (FdT) received a paltry 38.4%, while losing ground in Santa Fe and Córdoba, as well as many other important districts (Associated Press 2021). The JxC was victorious in 13 of the 24 districts in the nation, marking the first time in nearly 40 years that a Peronist coalition has lost its majority in both chambers of Congress (Spezzapria 2021). This is a shocking turn of events that will have numerous – and severe – ramifications on the effectiveness of the Fernández administration, as well as the political alliance as a whole. First and foremost, this electoral defeat on a nationwide scale highlights the sentiments of the court of public opinion: it is evident that the Argentine people are dissatisfied with the ways in which the current governing coalition has handled the Coronavirus pandemic and have voted accordingly. Second, the loss of the coalitional majority in both houses of Congress means that compromises and concessions will be of the upmost importance when it comes to achieving the coalition agenda. Third and finally, the result of the election elucidates the inherent weakness of Frente de Todos, an alliance of vastly differing ideologies that was “very effective from an electoral point of view, but very ineffective in governing” (Dennis 2021). Regardless of the causes of this electoral catastrophe, however, one thing remains clear: Peronism in Argentine politics is not what it once was. To that end, how has  26 the Peronist electoral coalition evolved over the years, and in what ways have these evolutions manifested themselves within the greater political realm? 2b. Alberto Fernández’s Frente de Todos The newest iteration of the Peronist political machine is the Frente de Todos, a coalition formed for the 2019 elections that is comprised of various political, economic, and social sectors. While certainly multidimensional and infinitely difficult to accurately quantify, the FdT is essentially comprised of four major political sectors.  The first among these is the Partido Justicialista (PJ), the main Peronist party that has existed in some capacity since the days of Juan Perón himself. It is far and away the largest faction within Peronism; in fact, the PJ alone constitutes 91 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 11 of the provincial governors in the nation. A byproduct of its enormity, the PJ serves as somewhat of a “catch-all” party within the Peronist alliance, sacrificing ideological homogeneity (with a very loosely defined set of guiding principles) to gain a large all-encompassing constituency. This quasi-populist mindset is very Peronist in nature and continues to define – not just the PJ – but the totality of Peronism. The second group consists of those Peronists and anti-Peronists that instead adhere to the principles of Kirchnerism, a movement spearheaded by former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner. Often described as a leftist splinter sect of Peronism (which by all accounts, is left-of-center to begin with), Kirchnerism began with the presidency of Néstor Kirchner in 2003. Since then, it has grown in popularity, much to the chagrin of many “traditional” Peronists. The third major sector is the Frente Renovador, a formerly dissident and anti-Kirchnerist wing of the Peronist party that aims to create “Peronism of the 21st Century” (Jorquera 2017). Members of the Frente Renovador – led by the career politician Sergio Massa – are considered to be more right-of-center; and it was this  27 ideological fracture that led to the mass exodus away from the leftist Kirchnerist alliance in 2013, giving rise to the election of the conservative Macri in 2015. The fourth and final sector consists of Peronist governors, leaders of the 23 provincias (provinces) of Argentina, as well as Federal District of Buenos Aires. Of the 24, 14 are either affiliated with FdT or the Partido Justicialista (PJ), the main Peronist political party; this constitutes a clear majority within the Argentine gubernatorial landscape. In addition to the various sects of Peronism, included within the electoral coalition are the minor parties that adhere to a variety of differing ideologies; included amongst this ideological smorgasbord are parties aligned with the tenets of “maoismo,” a political ideology synonymous with communism within Argentina (Clarín 2022).  With respect to the breadth of different ideologies, the FdT is certainly diverse; it receives support from the alliance of governors, the Frente Renovador (both of which are both right-of-center), the Kirchnerist faithful, the left-of-center social movements (such as the piqueteros), the aforementioned communist parties, as well as the other regional parties that exist within Argentina. These factions have come together to form the current Peronist coalition, one that has the widest breadth of support the nation has ever seen. The FdT also receives support from the various sub-factions within Peronism and Kirchnerism. For example, parties such as Proyecto Sur – a progressive Peronist party that fights for the nationalization of industries privatized by former president Carlos Menem – are part of the broader Peronist coalition, even if their tenets don’t entirely align (Pagina/12 2015). As of the 2021 midterm elections, 36 of the 72 members of the upper Argentine Senate (Senado de la nación Argentina) and 91 of the 257 members of the lower Chamber of Deputies (Cámara de Diputados) are affiliated with the FdT (PJ 2022).   28 But the FdT is not a mere political alliance; many social, domestic, and foreign actors are also a part of the new coalition. Adhering to Peronist traditions, the FdT has support from most of the large labor unions across the country, including the Argentine Workers’ Central Union (CGT). To that end, they have a wide base of support from blue-collar workers, as well as workers in the ancillary sectors (such as retail, hospitality, the public sector etc.). The FdT – along with Peronism as a whole – is also popular with lower-income workers, as well as workers in the informal labor sector, due to their emphasis on the promotion of labor and workers’ rights throughout its history. This current iteration of Peronism does highlight a marked difference between it and some of its predecessors (namely, the Peronist coalition during the Menem administration) in that previous Peronist alliances were considered to be more center-right and neoliberal. In contrast to these previous coalitions, the FdT is staunchly anti-neoliberal, and has sought to cut its ties to its free-market liberal predecessors of the 1990s. The table below depicts a comprehensive list of parties – both national and regional – within the Peronist electoral constituency since Néstor Kirchner’s FPV.   29 This ideological diversity, however, did little for the FdT during the most recent election. As mentioned previously, the 2021 midterms cemented the JxC coalition’s status as a significant and competitive political rival to the Peronist FdT, all the while giving credence to the “common perception that the country’s political elite are out of touch with reality” (Provitina 2021). But this is not a problem endemic within just the FdT. In fact, both the FdT and JxC lost supporters in droves, with electoral participation at 71%, the lowest figure since 1983, the year democracy was reinstated in Argentina (Dellacha 2021). This election clearly highlights the growing frustration of the Argentine people, whose country’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic – as well as the myriad of problems that came about as a result – has been devastatingly inadequate. To castigate the ineffectiveness of the current system, political malcontents adopted the rallying cry “que se vayan todos” (“let them all go”), an homage to the protests during the financial crisis of 2001 wherein then-President Fernando de la Rúa was forced to resign following his failure to effectively mitigate the adverse effects of the economic and political crises of his time (Provitina 2021). In this regard, political instability and the formation of new electoral coalitions seem to be inextricably linked. It was the inaction of the Frente de Todos that led to the rise in support for the Juntos por el Cambio. And it was the failures of the coalition of Fernando De la Rúa that led to the formation of Néstor Kirchner’s Frente para la Victoria.  2c. Néstor Kirchner’s Frente para la Victoria Founded on the heels of the 2001 recession in Argentina, the Frente para la Victoria (FPV) remained the dominant political coalition in Argentina until the 2015 election cycle (although the coalition was not officially disbanded until 2017). While the constitution of the coalition certainly evolved and changed over the course of the decade, the core of the FPV  30 consisted of the Peronist Partido Justicialista and Frente Grande, the Kirchnerist Kolina and Nuevo Encuentro parties, the socialist Partido Intransigente and Partido Solidario, the Communist party (Partido Comunista), and the Partido Humanista. In comparison to the 2021 midterm elections – which occurred after the initial success of the FdT in 2019 – the midterm elections of 2005 were a landslide in favor of the incumbent president’s political coalition. Though this election is often demarcated by the election of First Lady Cristina Kirchner to the Argentine Senate as the representative of the Buenos Aires province (who also defeated former First Lady Hilda González de Duhalde in the process), it also served as a massive vote of confidence in the newly formed Kirchnerist coalition (El Mundo 2005). To that end, the coalition won 69 of the 127 seats (54%) up for election in the Chamber of Deputies, a sharp contrast to the 50 seats (39%) won during the 2021 elections by the FdT (Ministerio del Interior 2005). In the upper house of Congress, the FPV won 17 of 24 seats (71%) in 2005, while the FdT won a paltry 9 of 24 (38%) in 2021.  At first glance, the disparity between the successes of the Kirchnerist coalition of 2005 and 2021 are glaring. Both elections came at the halfway point of the freshly elected Peronist president’s tenure, at a time when the country had been suffering through economic and social calamities. While it must be recognized that this comparison is not an entirely commensurate one (due to the fact that policies remediating the 2001 crisis had already been passed by the time Néstor took office), the results can be used as a rough barometer to gauge the success of the coalition in navigating the country through the respective crises. For the 2005 FPV, the crisis at hand was the 2001 Great Depression; for the 2021 FdT, the answer is obvious. While fundamentally different crises, one thing is certain: the voters in the 2021 election clearly neither  31 approved of – nor commended – the underwhelming efforts of the national government in mitigating the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In what other ways has the FdT shown itself to be the true Kirchnerist successor to the FPV? The most obvious answer is found within the makeup of the coalitions themselves. Of the eight main political parties that made up the bulk of the Frente para la Victoria, seven are also currently a part of Fernández’s Frente de Todos. This includes the Partido Justicialista, the single largest political party in the Argentine congress.   2d. Cristina Kirchner’s Unidad Ciudadana  In contrast to the two aforementioned political coalitions, however, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner’s Unidad Ciudadana (UC) never reached the national levels of political success as its predecessor and eventual successor. The UC coalition was formed ahead of the 2017 midterm elections with the campaign slogan “UNITE para #FrenarElSaqueo” (Unite to Stop the Looting) by former president and senator Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (Pagina/12 2017). In short, this was a decentralized Peronist effort united around a personalist leader in Cristina to defeat the center-right and conservative coalition Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change) that had won the 2015 presidential election, ending a national Peronist regime that had ruled the nation for over a decade. It was also the first Peronist coalition formed without the expressed support of the PJ; in fact, the UC had actually poached several parties from the FPV alliance, of which Cristina herself had been a leader (2017).  The coalition consisted of the Peronist Frente Grande and Compromiso Federal parties, as well as the Kirchnerist parties of Nuevo Encuentro, Partido de la Victoria, and Kolina (La Nación 2017). The coalitional makeup of the UC serves as another important distinction between  32 it and the other Peronist political alliances; whereas both the FdT and FPV consisted of a smorgasbord of ideologically diverse political parties from all across the country, the UC was neither ideologically nor geographically diverse. At its core, it was a Kirchnerist coalition held together by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner herself, created with the expressed intent of mitigating the effectiveness of center-right president Mauricio Macri. To that end, all 15 of the points within the campaign platform serve as scathing criticisms of Macri. For instance, point 10, “Mujer. Iguales y Vivas” (Women. Equal and Alive) is a response to a quote by Macri wherein he is credited to have said “all women like compliments, even if they’re told what a nice a-- they have” (2017)1. This is not to say that the entire platform was a vitriolic rejection of Macri and his center-right policies, but rather, a platform predicated upon capitalizing on the mistakes and misfortunes of the opposition.  In regard to the other positions taken up by the coalition platform, they are ideologically homogeneous to those of its predecessor, the FPV. The FPV electoral platform for the 2011 election states that one of its three main goals for the upcoming election was the continuation of economic policies that would diminish the wealth gap between rich and poor as to make Argentina the “most egalitarian nation in Latin America”; the platform proudly states, “gone are the times when the pocket of the workers was the adjustment variable” (Frente para la Victoria 2011). Similarly, the first of the campaign promises of the Unidad Ciudadana was to “recuperate what was lost: employment, salary, and working conditions.” To do this, the UC planned to increase purchasing power of the employee, all the while implementing firing bans for at least one year (Pagina/12 2017). Feasibility of the plans aside, it becomes clear that the basic premise of the Kirchnerist UC were similar to those of the FPV, highlighting their strong and  1 “A todas las mujeres les gustan los piropos, aunque les digan qué lindo culo tenés”   33 ideologically homogenous coalition of support. But how does the UC compare to the FdT, and how do all three coalitions demonstrate the evolution of Peronism in a political context?  2e. Political Analysis of Coalitional Makeup As stated previously, the FdT is a diverse political and social coalition that serves as the newest iteration of the Peronist/Kirchnerist traditions present in Argentina. To that end, many of the actors that have taken part in previous Peronist coalitions exist in some capacity in FdT, albeit with minute differences. From a political standpoint, every single major party within FPV is included within the FdT, with the largest actor being the Partido Justicialista (of which current president Alberto Fernández is the leader). Despite the similarities, however, there are also a myriad of differences that separate the coalitions.  First and foremost, the three Peronist/Kirchnerist coalitions were formed for vastly different reasons. With an impending presidential election, a hugely unpopular $57 billion IMF loan taken out by then-current president Mauricio Macri, and the economic health of the nation on the line, the FdT was formed with the Peronists’ backs against the wall. As the UC had shown just two years earlier, none of the splinter Peronist c
