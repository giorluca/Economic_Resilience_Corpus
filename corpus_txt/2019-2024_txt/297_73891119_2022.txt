These systems are crucial for temperature and humidity control, in which they ensure the quality of the final product by preventing paint defects and thus avoid the additional cost of reworking. This is especially true for water-based paints, in which evaporation and film formation processes are influenced by the temperature and humidity of the surrounding air. This study aims to investigate the incorporation of liquid desiccant technology into a conventional air management system for paint shops operating in different climates, which presents the novelty of the study. The technology is promising because it can regulate humidity, act as a dehumidifier or humidifier depending on the demand and stores energy in a thermo-chemical form. In addition, waste heat sources available in the paint shop can be used for the regeneration of the liquid desiccant solution. The techno-economic evaluation of this novel process indicates that the proposed system can control the temperature and humidity of the supply air within the range required for optimal painting and achieve significant energy savings in both cold and hot/humid climates, with a reduction of 44.4% and 33.6% of the energy cost compared to the conventional operation and a payback period of 6.15 and 5.74 years respectively, using calcium chloride as the desiccant solution. The sensitivity analysis investigates the effect of the energy and carbon price on the performance of the system. It is concluded that the integration of liquid desiccant technology into conventional air management systems for paint booths has a huge potential to increase the energy-efficiency of automotive painting.   1. Introduction Automotive manufacturing is a complex process that involves numerous facilities, processes, and energy sources. The various pro-cesses in the automotive manufacturing plant necessitate a high con-sumption of primary (fuel and electricity) and secondary (steam, compressed air, chilled and hot water) energy. Throughout the whole manufacturing process, whilst the body shop, powertrain, chassis and final assembly processes, which include metal treating, casting, forming, forging, joining, pressing, etc., are all energy-intensive, it has been re-ported that the paint shop consumes the most energy. Values ranging between one-third and one-half of the total energy consumed to produce a vehicle. A full review of the automotive manufacturing and painting process is presented in [1]. Paint provides aesthetic (optical quality and attractiveness) and physical properties (corrosion resistance, mechanical protection and protection against weather conditions) to the vehicle. Paint deposition and curing processes require a variety of operation steps and compo-nents and they consume a significant amount of electricity, fuel, com-pressed air, hot and chilled water, with painting and working booths accounting for the majority of the paint shop’s electricity and natural gas consumption [2]. The high air volume flow rates required by paint booths, working decks and ovens necessitate the use of electricity to operate the fans, whereas natural gas is primarily used to heat the air for both paint booth and oven operation. In recent decades, water-based paints have become the primary choice for automotive painting due to improved environmental performance (resulting in reduced emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) and overall paint quality (colour and brilliance offered by better rheology control) [3].

A typical example of the paint booth and the relevant air management system.  A. Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 1156543compared to solvent-based paints, the effect of temperature and hu-midity on paint evaporation and film formation is more sensitive for water-based paints, meaning they have a higher energy consumption when supplying air within the required temperature and humidity range. The process of paint evaporation and film formation is driven by factors such as the temperature of the painted surface, the vapour pressure of the solvent, the airflow over the painted surface and the temperature and humidity of the air surrounding the vehicle in the paint spraying booth [4]. Undesired humidity in the paint booth will cause paint defects such as checking, blistering, popping, etc. [5]. If too much water remains trapped in the paint film, it will spot the painted surface resulting in popping, blistering, collapse of the inner layers, etc. Whereas an overly dry environment, may cause the paint layer to harden too quickly, resulting in cracks and lesions. Vehicle reworking can be required to remove paint defects, which is a time-consuming and costly process. The importance of temperature and humidity control in paint booths is one of the justifications for the large amount of energy that automotive manufacturers currently consume. Paint booths are isolated enclosures for paint spraying operation to minimise exposure to VOCs and particulate matter (PM) present in the paint [6]. Depending on the configuration of the air supply unit (ASU) which delivers air to the paint booth, technological solutions employing only external air or recovering exhaust air from the paint booth can be found in the automotive paint shop. Fig. 1 shows how the conventional air management system for air supplied to paint booths consists of two main units: (i) an ASU with 100% outdoor air; and (ii) an air regener-ation unit (ARU) with mixed recirculated air and outdoor air. Supplying air by ASUs within consistent temperature and humidity ranges is a top priority for the painting process quality. The outdoor air is aspirated by fans, filtered in pocket filters, air-conditioned and sup-plied into the spray-painting booth [7]. Depending on the outdoor air conditions, ASUs must be able to fulfil different requirements during the year, such as filtration, heating/cooling, and (de)humidification. In cold climates, the air supplied to the paint booth is heated and humidified until the required values of temperature and humidity for optimal painting are achieved. The air is heated to 23 ◦C and then humidified by using boiled water in a steam humidifier. Alternatively, the air is heated until the isenthalpic line is reached (at a minimum temperature of about 40 ◦C in winter) and then humidified/cooled by spraying water droplets in an adiabatic humidifier. On the contrary in hotter climates, air re-quires dehumidification (by condensation) and is reheated. The process of outdoor air supply for painting is energy-intensive due to the high volume of air required in the paint shop (high electricity consumption for fans) and the need for heating, cooling and de/humidification. ARUs have been developed as an energy-efficient strategy to reduce energy consumption for paint booth air-conditioning, by recovering exhaust air from the paint booth and partially mixing it with outdoor air. ARUs are less sensitive to outdoor air conditions [5]. The quantity of recirculated air is a function of the system used to collect over-sprayed paint [8,9], which can typically recirculate 75–85% of the air back to the paint booth [2]. The exhaust air from the paint booth must be usually cooled down and dehumidified to remove sensible and latent heat gains in the paint booth before being reused for spraying application. Thermal energy recovery, management and utilisation is a central strategy to leverage the excess heat from the paint shop and to realise a more efficient manufacturing process. Common sources of waste heat for the automotive manufacturing process include high-, medium- and low-temperature industrial systems for heating (furnaces, kilns, ovens, dryers and boilers) and their exhaust gases, compressed air, ventilation and refrigeration. As reported by Roelant et al. [10], positive energetic, economic and environmental benefits can be obtained by the realisation of an on-site heat recovery network that can reduce the cost of the heating, cooling, and paint drying process. In such a scenario, liquid desiccant technology could be appealing due to its temperature and humidity control characteristics [11], capa-bility to store thermal energy in thermo-chemical form [12], being regenerated by low-grade heat sources at 45–70 ◦C [13] and being flexible, i.e. dehumidifiers and humidifier (regenerators) can be located in different locations [13]. Liquid desiccant technology finds applica-tions in different sectors, such as the manufacturing, processing and packaging of food, beverages, paper, textiles, etc., residential buildings, hospitals and operating rooms, museums, libraries, etc. [14]. The main working fluids used as desiccant solutions are LiCl, LiBr, CaCl2, HCO2K, and MgCl2 aqueous solutions [15]. Each of these fluids presents positive and negative aspects regarding the liquid desiccant process. LiCl and LiBr present the highest dehumidification ability, but their cost is high and the salts used are corrosive to metals. The performance and limited corrosion of alternative desiccant solutions, such as HCO2K, makes it interesting for application as a stand-alone working fluid or in combi-nation with other desiccant solutions [16]. CaCl2 present lower dehu-midification performance but its lower cost makes it competitive for use in large volume systems, such as paint booth ventilation systems. The potential impact of the liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting is further illustrated in Fig. 2. The literature review showed that the knowledge of liquid desiccant technology has not been extensively transferred to the automotive painting sector and there are limited studies that attempted to evaluate the potential application of the technology for the automotive painting process prior to this research. Guan et al. [17] investigated the use of a segmented liquid desiccant system driven by a heat pump for a bus paint shop in Henan, China. The study identified that energy savings of about 40% of the total could be achieved by the liquid desiccant technology in comparison to the conventional operation due to the reduction of the cooling load of the outdoor air and the avoidance of air reheating after dehumidification by condensation. The use of the liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting in climates that require heating and humidification of the outdoor air was not assessed before. This study aims to investigate for the first time from a technical and economic point of view the potential of the liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting in both cold and hot/humid climates and how the outdoor air conditions affect the configuration of the liquid desiccant system inte-grated into the conventional air management system for paint shops, the choice of the desiccant solution, etc. Concerns in this matter had led to this research funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), which main aim was to study the efficient use of the available heat and the reduction of the energy consumption at a paint shop located in the UK, which represents the baseline case for this study. Therefore, this study investigates from a technological and economic point of view the utilisation of the liquid desiccant technology in an automotive paint shop where humidity control is a key working parameter. This article is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the meth-odology used for the techno-economic appraisal of the use of liquid desiccant technology in paint booth operation. Section 3 describes and quantifies the waste heat sources that are potentially available for heat recovery at the baseline paint shop, while Section 4 illustrates the effect of the outdoor air on the painting operation, identifying a psychrometric-based strategy for the operation of the liquid desiccant air handling unit. Sections 5 shows the results of the techno-economic analysis for cold and hot/humid climates and is complemented by a final discussion, which describes the effect of energy and carbon prices on the feasibility of the process and suggests future improvements required by the liquid desiccant technology to further increase its competitiveness and limitations of the study. 2. Methodology The aim of this research is to develop a methodology for identifying feasible and cost-effective designs for heat recovery processes with liquid desiccant technology in different applications. A framework for the heat recovery process from a technological and economic point of view was developed and used for the analysis of two case studies, as A. Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 1156544shown in Fig. 3. The assessment categories used for the feasibility study are (i) quantification and potential use of low-grade waste heat sources, (ii) analysis of outdoor air conditions, (iii) performance analysis, (iv) appraisal of economic benefits (including the cost benefit associated with the air pollution emissions) of the heat recovery process. For heat recovery processes with “open-air” systems, such as liquid desiccant technology, it is fundamental to consider the availability and requirements of waste heat of the technology (first step of the feasibility analysis) together with outdoor air conditions (second step of the analysis) to identify the best performing configuration of the liquid desiccant system. Energy and mass balance equations solved by using the moisture and enthalpy effectiveness of the dehumidification and regeneration processes were used to estimate the performance of the liquid desiccant technology and assess the technological feasibility of the heat recovery process in terms of temperature/moisture control and waste heat demand. The outlet parameters of the performance analysis were then used to estimate the main capital costs and operating expenses identified as relevant for the liquid desiccant process and to assess the economic feasibility of using the liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting for different application cases. 2.1. Waste heat availability analysis The identification and quantification of low-grade heat sources is fundamental for technical and economic appraisal. The choice of the best configuration for the liquid desiccant system is dependent on the required energy demand and application but most importantly on the availability of waste heat. To assess that, the quantity, quality and continuity of the available low-grade waste heat sources were evaluated for the baseline paint shop. The analysis was performed based on the collection of primary or secondary data (i.e. data published in literature). 2.2. Outdoor air analysis Being an “open-air” technology, the performance of liquid desiccant systems is affected by the state of outdoor ambient air. This in turn, influences the selection of the best performing working fluid. The Fig. 2. Potential impact of the liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting.  Fig. 3.

Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 1156545analysis of the outdoor air condition in the various case studies aids in providing a preliminary estimate of the potential economic savings and designing a case-specific configuration of the liquid desiccant system for the application requirement. The main collected parameters for the outdoor air analysis were the dry-bulb temperature, TDB, relative hu-midity, RH, moisture content, ω, and wet-bulb temperature, TWB. The outdoor air data were collected from [18] every three hours and rep-resented on a psychrometric chart along with the temperature and hu-midity demand for optimal painting to evaluate the case studies’ year- round demand. The influence of the outdoor air condition on the oper-ation of the ASUs for optimal painting operation was identified and a psychrometric-based strategy for operating the liquid desiccant air handling unit was proposed. 2.3. Performance analysis Coupled heat and mass transfer between the solution and the air occurs in the dehumidifier. The desiccant solution with suitable tem-perature and concentration has low equilibrium vapour pressure, allowing moisture to be removed from the air while diluting the solution and releasing heat of absorption. The governing equations in the dehumidifier are given as follows [19]:  • Energy balance: msol,out⋅hsol,out − msol,in⋅hsol,in + ma⋅(ha,in − ha,out)= 0 (1)  • Desiccant solution mass balance: msol,in⋅xsol,in = msol,out⋅xsol,out (2)    • Moisture mass balance: msol,out − msol,in − ma⋅(ωa,in − ωa,out)= 0 (3) where msol,in and msol,out represent the mass flow rate of the desiccant solution (kg/s) at the inlet and outlet of the dehumidifier, respectively, xsol,in and xsol,out represent the mass of salt in the desiccant solution (kgsalt/kgsol) at the inlet and outlet of the dehumidifier, respectively, hsol, in and hsol,out represent the enthalpy of the desiccant solution (kJ/kg) at the inlet and outlet of the dehumidifier, respectively, ma represents the mass flow rate of dry air (kg/s), ωa,in and ωa,out represent the moisture content of the air (kgH2O/kgdry air) at the inlet and outlet of the dehu-midifier, respectively, and ha,in and ha,out represent the enthalpy of the air (kJ/kg) at the inlet and outlet of the dehumidifier, respectively. The regenerator, on the other hand, undergoes the inverse process. The hot and diluted desiccant solution (characterised by high equilibrium vapour pressure) desorbs moisture to the air, concentrating the solution. Three heat exchangers are considered for the desiccant system: one solution-to-solution heat exchanger, one for solution heating and one for solution cooling. The solution-to-solution heat exchanger is used to improve energy efficiency by precooling the warm concentrated solu-tion leaving the regenerator and preheating the diluted solution leaving the dehumidifier. There is no direct contact between the two desiccant solutions, and the process involves only sensible heat transfer. The temperature efficiency of the solution-to-solution heat exchanger can be defined as follows [20]: εSHE =Thot,in − Thot,outThot,in − Tcold,in(4) where Thot,in, Thot,out and Tcold,in represent the temperature of the hot desiccant solution (concentrated) at the inlet and outlet of the solution heat exchanger and that of the cold desiccant solution (diluted) at the inlet of the solution heat exchanger, respectively. For the solution-to- solution heat exchanger, an efficiency of 0.5 was considered in this study [20]. The desiccant solution must be heated and cooled by the solution heater and cooler to achieve the conditions required for the regeneration and dehumidification processes, respectively. The effi-ciency of the solution heater and cooler was assumed as 0.75 [20]. To carry out a simple performance prediction and preliminarily design dehumidifiers and regenerators, empirical correlations of two parameters, moisture effectiveness and enthalpy effectiveness, have been proposed. These parameters are incorporated into Eqs. (1–3) for performance prediction of the liquid desiccant technology. The moisture effectiveness, εω, is defined as a dimensionless ratio of the actual mois-ture content reduction/increase of the air to the maximum potential reduction/increase when the air and the inlet liquid desiccant solution reach an equilibrium state. The moisture effectiveness for the dehu-midification and regeneration process are expressed in Eqs. (5) and (6), respectively [21]: εω,deh =ωa,in − ωa,outωa,in − ωeq,sol(5)  εω,reg =ωa,out − ωa,inωeq,sol − ωa,in(6) where ωa,in and ωa,out represent the moisture content of the air at the inlet and outlet of the dehumidifier/regenerator, respectively, while ωeq, sol is the equilibrium moisture content of the desiccant solution, which is defined as the moisture content of the air in equilibrium with the inlet solution. Similarly, the enthalpy effectiveness of the dehumidification and regeneration process are evaluated in Eqs. (7) and (8), respectively [21]: εh,deh =ha,in − ha,outha,in − heq,sol(7)  εh,reg =ha,out − ha,inheq,sol − ha,in(8) where ha,in and ha,out represent the enthalpy of the air at the inlet and outlet of the dehumidifier/regenerator, respectively, while heq,sol is the enthalpy of the air in equilibrium with the solution. Based on the analysis of secondary experimental data [22–26] and correlations available in the literature [27–33], four correlations for the moisture and enthalpy effectiveness of the dehumidification and regeneration process were derived, as expressed in Eq. (9): εω,h = C1⋅(msolma)C2⋅(TK,solTK,a)C3⋅(heq,solha)C4⋅(ωeq,solωa)C5⋅tC6 ⋅(aeap)C7(9) where C1,…, C7 are the fitting constants obtained through nonlinear regression analysis using power law from the collected experimental data, msol and ma are the mass flow rate (kg/s) of the desiccant solution and the air, TK,sol and TK,a are the inlet temperature of the desiccant solution and the air (in Kelvin), ha and heq,sol are the enthalpy of the inlet air and the air in equilibrium with the desiccant solution (kJ/kg), ωa and ωeq,sol are the moisture content of the inlet air and the air in equilibrium with the desiccant solution (kgH2O/kgair), t is the contact time between air and solution (s), ae and ap are the effective and the surface area to volume ratio of the packing material (m2/m3). The calculation of t and ae is described in [34] and [35,36], respectively. The values of C1,…, C7 for the moisture and enthalpy effectiveness correlations of the dehumidifi-cation and regeneration process are reported in Table 1. Once the moisture effectiveness of the dehumidification or regen-eration process is calculated based on Eq. (9), the moisture content of the outlet air can be calculated using Eqs. (5) or (6) for given moisture content of the inlet air and desiccant solution. Similarly, using Eq. (7) or (8) for specified inlet air and desiccant solution conditions, the enthalpy effectiveness can be estimated using Eq. (9) and used to calculate the enthalpy of the outlet air (and its temperature once the moisture content is known) in the dehumidifier or regenerator. Once the mass flow rate, temperature, and moisture content of the outlet air are known, Eqs. (1–3) can be used to calculate the mass flow rate, temperature, and concentration of the outlet solution. Eq. (4) is then used to calculate the A. Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 1156546waste heat and heat rejection demands for the solution-to-solution heat exchanger and the solution heater and cooler. 2.4. Economic analysis (taking account of equipment, energy and emissions) The detailed list of the equations used to estimate the CAPEX and OPEX of the main equipment considered in the economic analysis is reported in Table 2. A description of the parameters listed for each equation is presented in the next paragraphs. The total capital expenditure, CAPEX, factored into the economic assessment analysis was the sum of various components, including liquid desiccant technology, desiccant solution, storage tanks, addi-tional pumps, and cooling towers. For calculating the capital cost of liquid desiccant systems, a cost function based on the air volume flow rate was regressed in [37] and used to calculate the capital cost of the liquid desiccant system as reported in Eq. (10), where CAPEXLD is the capital cost (£) of the liquid desiccant system, Va is the air volume flow rate (m3/h) and C£,€ is the conversion pound-to-euro (assumed as 1.11 in the analysis). Two assumptions were considered in the liquid desiccant CAPEX estimation: (i) the setup costs are included in the CAPEX of the desiccant system, (ii) the cost is inclusive of auxiliary components (pumps, fans, solution heater/cooler and solution heat exchanger). For the salt used in the desiccant solution, the capital cost, CAPEXsalt, was estimated through Eq. (11), where CAPEXsalt is the capital cost for the desiccant solution (£), xsol and msol are the mass fraction (kgsalt/kgsol) and the mass flow rate (kg/s) of the desiccant solution, respectively, Csalt is the cost per kg of desiccant salt, as reported in [15] (the cost of one kg of LiCl is £6.48, while that of one kg of CaCl2 is £0.224), tstorage is the minimum time required for continuous operation of the system, assumed as 30 min, and NDeh/Reg is the number of air-solution contactors (dehumidifiers or regenerators) used in each case study. The sizing of the storage tank was based on the volume of solution calculated by Eq. (11) and the number of storage tanks required by the process. Once the volume of desiccant solution that is required in the system had been determined, the cost of the storage tank was obtained based on the manufacturer’s price. For the cost of additional pumps, a cost function was regressed by Zalewski et al. [38], as shown in Eq. (12), where CAPEXPump is the capital cost of the pump (£), a = 16.9049, b = 556.444, msol is the pump flow rate (kg/s), and C£,$ is the pound-to-dollar con-version (assumed as 1.30 in the analysis). The pump flow rates required by the process were determined based on the performance analysis. For heat rejection with wet cooling towers, a specific cost function was regressed by Lucas et al. [40] and used to calculate the capital cost in Eq. (14), where CAPEXCT is the capital cost (£/kW) of the wet cooling tower, Q is the heat rejection capacity of the cooling tower (kW). For operating expenses, OPEX, the cost is the one required to operate the components of the system: heating and cooling equipment, solution pumps [39], air blowing over the wetted packing material [41], hu-midifiers [42] and cooling towers [40]. Energy cost (natural gas and electricity price) has a primary effect on the OPEX and the cost- effectiveness of the process. The electricity and natural gas tariffs assumed in the economic analysis were £110/MWh and £23/MWh, respectively [43]. For solution pumping, the number of pumps and their energy consumption were determined based on the results of the per-formance analysis. The annual operation cost of a solution pump, OPEXPump (£/y), was calculated as reported in Eq. (13), where EPump is the pump power requirement (kW), OperatingHours is the number of hours per year that the pump is in operation (h/y) and CEl is the elec-tricity price (£/kWh). For the operating cost required to blow the air over the packing material, the air velocity and size of the packing play a primary role in the determination of the pressure drop, which can result in a high cost if the size of the packing is large. In the study, the addi-tional pressure drop due to the liquid desiccant system, ΔPspec, was calculated for cross-flow dehumidifiers/regenerators as reported by Liu et al. [41] and reported in Eq. (16), where ΔPspec is the additional pres-sure drop due to the liquid desiccant system per unit of thickness of the packing (Pa/m) and Ua is the air superficial velocity (m/s). The annual operating cost to blow the air over the packing material, OPEXAirBlowing (£/y), was then calculated as reported in Eq. (17), where L is the length of packing material (m), Va is the air volume flow rate (m3/h), Oper-atingHours is the number of hours per year that the dehumidifier/ regenerator is in operation (h/y) and CEl is the electricity price (£/kWh). Various types of humidifiers (isothermal or adiabatic) are used in air supply units deployed for automotive painting operation, each with its own characteristics in terms of performance and cost [5]. In this study, high-pressure humidifiers were considered. As reported by Lazzarin and Nalini [42], the electricity consumption for their operation, CHum, is 0.0055 kWh/kgH2O,evap. The annual cost to operate the humidifier, OPEXHum (£/y), was calculated as reported in Eq. (18), where QHum is the annual humidity requirement (kgH2O,evap/y) estimated from perfor-mance analysis and CEl is the electricity price (£/kWh). For heat rejec-tion with wet cooling towers, an operating cost function for the electrical power required by a centrifugal system and dependent on the heat rejection was regressed by Lucas et al. [40] and included in Eq.

Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 1156547bulb temperature of the outdoor air limits the heat rejection ability of the wet cooling tower, an alternative strategy for solution cooling, such as the use of an electrical chiller, was considered. The analysis is concluded by the evaluation of the environmental benefits resulting from the use of liquid desiccant technology instead of the conventional one and the cost associated with air pollution emis-sions. The air pollutants considered in the analysis were carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). The annual air emission of pollutants was calculated as shown in Eq.(19) [44]: Ppoll =∑i(φi,elect⋅Eelect + φi,NG⋅ENG)(19) where Ppoll is the total emission of pollutants (kg), φi,elect and φi,NG are the coefficients of emission for different pollutants in the UK in 2019 attributable to the annual consumption of electricity, Eelect, and natural gas, ENG, calculated in kWh/y from performance analysis, respectively. The values of the coefficients of emission of the considered pollutants were obtained from [45] and reported in Table 3. The emissions affect the economic feasibility of the process due to the carbon emission price, in line with the Government’s decarbonisation policies, as presented in [46]. The value of the carbon price, CCO2e, was considered as £16/tonCO2e [47]. The emissions in terms of CO2e of CH4 and N2O were calculated by multiplying the emission of the pollutant by its value of global warming potential (GWP), where GWPCH4 was consid-ered as 25 kgCO2e/kgCH4 and GWPN2O as 298 kgCO2e/kgN2O [48]. The annual cost for the carbon price, OPEXCarbon (£/y), was calculated based on the carbon price and the emissions produced from the technology, PCO2e (tonCO2e/y), as reported in Eq. (20): OPEXCarbon =PCO2e⋅CCO2e1016.47(20) The cost-effectiveness of the liquid desiccant process was assessed using four different economic indicators: the payback period, the levelised cost of saved energy (LCOSE), the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR). The payback period represents a simple comparison between capital and operational costs of the conventional and replace-ment technology and identifies the time required for the economic re-turn on the initial investment, as reported in Eq. (21) [44]: Paybackperiod =CAPEXrepl − CAPEXconvOPEXconv − OPEXrepl(21) where CAPEXrepl (£) and CAPEXconv (£), and OPEXrepl (£/y) and OPEXconv (£/y) represent the capital and operational cost of the replacement and conventional technology, respectively. CAPEXconv was assumed equal to zero because a retrofitting project was considered. Payback period analysis is used by companies for preliminary screening of heat recovery projects due to its simplicity and practicality [49]. For heat recovery processes, the limit of payback period analysis is to not include the long-term benefits of the heat recovery technology, which lifespan could be longer than the payback period. A value of 3 years is recommended in the literature for industrial projects [50]. To evaluate the feasibility of the heat recovery process over the lifespan of the technology and the time value of the money (TVM), three additional metrics were used. These alternative metrics are based on the method of discounted evaluation, where the value of the money changes with time, depending on the life of the project, the discount rate, etc. [51]. The LCOSE indicates the cost for saving each kilowatt-hour of electric or thermal energy by replacing the conventional system over the lifespan of the technology, defined in Eq. (22) [52]: LCOSE =InvestmentEnergysaved=CAPEXrepl − CAPEXconv +∑nk=1[OPEXrepl(1+i)k]∑nk=1[Econv − Erepl(1+i)k](22) where the parameter expresses the economic viability (£/kWh) of the technology replacement over the lifespan of the machine, n, assumed as 20 years [53], and i is the discount rate, assumed as 5% in the analysis [50]. For the evaluation of the LCOSE, a comparison with the retail price energy paid by the consumer was performed. If the retail energy cost was higher than the LCOSE, then the heat recovery process would save en-ergy compared to conventional technology. The NPV is one of the most commonly used tools for analysis of the profitability of heat recovery processes and is defined as the sum of the annual discounted cash flows over a period of n years [54], as reported in Eq. (23): NPV =∑nk=1(OPEXconv,k − OPEXrepl,k − CAPEXrepl + CAPEXconv)(1 + i)k(23) Heat recovery processes with NPV higher than zero present economic return over the lifetime of the technology. The NPV value can be used for the comparison of heat recovery processes. When comparing different heat recovery projects, the one with a higher NPV has a higher economic return and should be selected. The discount rate, i, which determination is equivocal and depends on the economic risk that the company is willing to take for an investment [50], influences the economic feasi-bility analysis performed with LCOSE and NPV. As an alternative, the IRR, defined as the discount rate at which the NPV is equal to zero, was used. Compared to LCOSE and NPV, the advantage of using the IRR is its independence on the discount rate which makes the metrics represen-tative of the quality of the heat recovery process, enabling better com-parison between different projects [54]. Higher IRR means higher efficiency of the heat recovery process from an economic point of view. It is reported that every investment with an IRR of over 15% should be accepted [51]. The economic analysis was concluded by the evaluation of the ratio between the NPV and the CAPEX to highlight the margin between the economic return and the initial investment of the heat re-covery process. Assumptions used in the economic analysis are sum-marised in Table 4. 3. Waste heat availability analysis Low-temperature waste heat from VOCs treatment systems (e.g. regenerative thermal oxidiser), compressed air systems, chilled water systems, intermediate ovens, etc. is available abundantly but has not been efficiently exploited in the paint shop [1]. The idea of exploiting these heat sources to regenerate a liquid desiccant solution, which would be potentially able to (i) provide heating, cooling, and de/hu-midification, as required by the painting process and (ii) efficiently Table 3 Coefficients of emission from different energy sources in UK in 2019, adapted from [45].

Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 1156548control temperature and humidity in paint booths, reducing paint defect, vehicle reworking and additional costs, was explored. The characteristics (quantity, quality, temporal availability and location) of three potential sources of waste heat available at the paint shop but currently unexploited were evaluated. In the calculations, it was assumed that the paint shop operates 22.5 h per day, 265 days per year (equivalent to 5,962.5 h/y).  • Regenerative thermal oxidiser (RTO): after being exhausted by the painting operation, the process air is sent to the RTO, where it is burnt at about 800 ◦C to remove the VOC present. The ceramic material of the RTO chamber is effective in storing thermal energy for internal heat recovery and the air exhausted by the RTO chamber (usually with a concentration of VOCs lower than 0.01%) is sent to the stack at a temperature of 174 ± 20 ◦C. The process air flow rate varies according to vehicle production, with a maximum flow rate of 14,000 m3/h and nominal and minimum operating conditions of 75% and one-third of the maximum flow rate, respectively. The system operates in nominal condition most of the time. The acid dew point of VOCs in the exhaust stream limits the amount of heat that can be recovered from the RTO [55]. As such, the temperature of the exhaust air must not be lowered than 110 ◦C. During normal oper-ation, the available waste heat ranges between 62.18 and 156.14 kW. As such, an average of 650.87 MWh/y of heat could be recovered from the RTO stack. Table 5 summarises the characteristics of waste heat that could be recovered from the RTO.  • Compressed air units: in the ultra-low temperature range, the heat released by the cooling circuit of the compressed air system could be recovered. The cooling water for water-cooled compressors is currently used in automotive manufacturing plants for space heating, hot water production, etc. [1] In the baseline case study, four water- cooled units producing about 9,000 m3/h of compressed air were employed in the paint shop, with a minimum duty requirement of 5,520 m3/h. Table 6 summarises the specifications of the compressed air systems used in the paint shop. As illustrated in Table 6, the overall compressed air system requires 975.8 kW of power. Considering a conversion efficiency of 10% [56], approximately 878.22 kW of heat is dissipated from the compressed air units when all the compressors are in operation. A minimal duty of 92 m3/min of compressed air is required when the paint shop is in opera-tion, resulting in the continuous availability of approximately 550 kW of heat. In the baseline paint shop, this heat is removed through a water- cooled system, which produces hot water at 47 ◦C.  • Condenser of the chilled water system: in a temperature range comparable to that of compressed air systems, the heat released by the condenser of chilled water systems could be recovered. In the paint shop, an air-cooled chiller system with a cooling capacity of 1 MW is currently used. Air-cooled chillers require approximately 3.4–5.7 m3/min of coolant per kW [57]. Considering the cooling capacity of the chiller system and a ΔT of 5 ◦C for the hot water production, the waste heat available from the chilled water system ranges between 356.77 kW and 594.61 kW in a temperature range between 40.9 ◦C and 43.1 ◦C, resulting in an average of 2,836.3 MWh/y of heat annually available from the paint shop. Table 7 compares the identified waste heat sources available in the plant and their potential for heat recovery. When the paint shop is in operation, a minimum of 934.41 kW of waste heat is available from the RTO, the compressors and the chilled water system. The low quality of the heat available from the air-cooled chilled water systems and the need for additional heat exchangers for hot water production make its use for liquid desiccant regeneration less appealing. The heat available from the RTO could be appealing for liquid desiccant regeneration, in particular considering the fluctuating nature of RTO operation and the ability of the desiccant solutions to store thermal energy in the form of concentrated solution. This would allow bridging the intermittent operation of the RTO between the minimum and maximum operating conditions, regenerating and storing solution when more heat is avail-able and ensuring a continuous temperature and humidity control pro-cess. However, the higher temperature of the waste heat available at the RTO stack suggests a different approach for its recovery, as for example by using absorption chillers capable of reducing the electricity con-sumption of the chilled water system at the paint shop. As such, the heat recovery from the chilled water system and the RTO was discarded in the study. On the contrary, the high quantity of hot water produced by the compressors’ cooling at a low temperature (47 ◦C) is appealing for liquid desiccant regeneration and is considered further in the analysis.

Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 11565494. Outdoor air condition analysis 4.1. Psychrometrics of painting process According to the annual handling requirements of the outdoor air with regard to the optimal painting demand with water-based paint (23 ± 1 ◦C, 70 ± 2% RH), the psychrometric chart can be divided into 6 different zones, as shown in Fig. 4. The psychrometric chart is divided into two main sections by two horizontal lines that pass through the minimum and maximum accept-able moisture content values. Humidification is required below the minimum moisture content line (when ω is equal to or lower than 11.2 gH2O/kgda, i.e. Zones I and II), while dehumidification is required above the maximum moisture content line (when ω is equal to or higher than 13.5 gH2O/kgda, i.e. Zones V and VI). The isenthalpic line, which passes through 23 ◦C and 70% RH (h = 54.46 kJ/kgda) further divides the psychrometric chart, identifying points for evaporative cooling. This zone division can be used to assess the capability of liquid desiccant technology as a replacement for traditional air handling units in auto-motive painting processes, and it is further described:  • In Zone I, heating and humidification are required. The moisture content is lower than the value required for painting. The traditional method for using adiabatic humidifiers involves heating the air until it reaches the isenthalpic line and then spraying water into it to reach the recommended painting window on the psychrometric chart.  • In Zone II, cooling and humidification are required. The moisture content is lower than the value required for painting, but the tem-perature is significantly higher. Sensible heat is removed by cooling the air until the isenthalpic line is reached and then spraying water into it to reach the recommended painting window on the psychro-metric chart.  • In Zone III, only heating is required. The moisture content is the same as that required by the painting process, but the temperature is lower. Air heating is the most efficient and economical strategy for the process.  • In Zone IV, only sensible cooling is required. The moisture content in the air is within the range required by the painting process but its temperature is higher. Conventional cooling is the most efficient and economical strategy for the process.  • In Zone V, moisture removal is required. While the temperature of the air is lower than the value required for painting, its moisture content is higher. The conventional process involves cooling and water condensation until the requirement in terms of moisture content is reached and then reheating. The process is not particularly efficient. • In Zone VI, cooling and dehumidification are required. This condi-tion, typical of hot and humid climates such as South-East Asia, re-quires high consumption of electricity and fossil fuel for moisture removal by condensation and reheating with conventional technol-ogy. Liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting application could be also particularly favourable in Zone VI. Based on the previous considerations, liquid desiccant technology can be integrated into automotive painting air handling units to achieve energy-efficient dehumidification and/or humidification, as shown in Fig. 5. Because the system is open-cycle, the regenerator and dehu-midifier can be separated and strategically placed near the locations where dehumidification/cooling and humidification/heating processes are required. Each air handling unit, as shown in Fig. 5, is made up of an air-solution contactor (regenerator or dehumidifier), humidifier, droplet separator, cooler, heater, pocket filters and fans. To form the entire liquid desiccant system, besides dehumidifier and regenerator, two storage tanks (for diluted and concentrated solutions, respectively), a solution heat exchanger, one solution heater for waste heat recovery, and one solution cooler (cooling tower or chilled water system) are needed. The storage tanks are used to store the desiccant solution at various concentrations and to vary the solution flow rate based on the ASU and ARU operation requirements. The new liquid desiccant air handling unit must meet the air requirement and be able to operate all year. 4.2. Region selection Principal automotive manufacturers are multinational companies with manufacturing plants located all over the world. The realisation of innovative painting strategies able to efficiently work in different cli-mates would be advantageous to study and develop the technology. As such, the psychrometric chart developed in Fig. 4 was used for the identification of alternative manufacturing sites where the technology could be favourable. A literature review of the world’s major automotive manufacturing plants was conducted and classified by region to assess the potential of liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting in different climates [58]. The framework developed for this analysis is as follows:  • choice of alternative sites of automotive manufacturing plants. Fig. 4. Sub-division of the psychrometric chart based on the automotive painting process requirement with water-based paint.  A. Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 11565410• analysis of temperature and moisture control requirement for ASU and ARU on the psychrometric chart for alternative manufacturing plants.  • calculation of the difference between the annual temperature, moisture content and enthalpy difference of both outdoor and recirculated air and the water-based optimal painting condition for the identified manufacturing plants and comparison with the refer-ence case.  • identification of alternative sites for liquid desiccant automotive painting and techno-economic performance analysis. Appendix A contains a complete list of the automotive manufacturing plants that were considered in the region selection analysis for the operation of liquid desiccant air handling units, showing the process on psychrometric charts and the differences in temperature and relative humidity between the outdoor air conditions and optimal painting demand. In operating the novel configuration of the liquid desiccant air handling unit for automotive painting application, it is required that the difference in moisture content between the outdoor air and the optimal painting requirement is significant. It is worth noting that:  • for cold climates, conventional systems consume large amounts of energy to heat and humidify outdoor air for the painting operation requirement. The novel liquid desiccant air handling unit could produce significant benefits in terms of natural gas consumption reduction. The feasibility of the technology in cold climates repre-sents the baseline case of the study. Cheap desiccant solutions with higher desorption ability (such as CaCl2) can find application in this climate.  • for climates where the air to supply to paint booths requires energy consuming heating/humidification in winter and energy-consuming cooling/dehumidification in summer, the ability of the technology to use the same desiccant solution to supply air with temperature and humidity within the range required for optimal painting may not be insured. Highly performing cooling/dehumidification processes might not be accomplished by CaCl2 (particularly at low concen-tration) as well as heating and humidification with LiCl solution. The use of two different desiccant solution cycles (one for humidification and one for dehumidification) could find application in this climate. Further studies should be conducted to evaluate the potential of such a configuration.  • for hot and humid climates with outdoor air in Zones V and VI of the psychrometric chart in Fig. 4, the conventional technology for painting operation consumes large amounts of energy to cool, dehumidify and reheat both the outdoor and the recirculated air all year round. These climates might benefit from the use of liquid desiccant air handling units for painting. The application of the liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting was investigated in cold (such as the UK) and hot/humid (such as Singapore) climates to highlight differences in the operating condi-tion and compare technological ability and economic performance. For the UK, the weather data collected for the year 2017 showed that heating and humidifying the outdoor air is required mostly throughout the year whilst cooling and dehumidification are necessary for only a few days in summer to reach the desired condition for optimal painting. On the contrary, the outdoor air condition analysis in Singapore showed little variation in temperature and humidity throughout the year and constant demand for dehumidification to reach the desired condition for optimal painting. 5. Results and discussion 5.1. Performance analysis Based on the psychrometric chart for water-based painting operation described in Section 4.1, the multifunction ability of the liquid desic-cant air handling unit (ASU/ARU) operation and the framework used for the simulation of the annual performance of the technology is shown in Fig. 6. According to the outdoor air condition (temperature and hu-midity), the main components of the air handling unit (liquid desiccant system, humidifier, heater and chiller) are operated to supply the de-mand for optimal painting in paint booths. 5.1.1. Cold climates The outdoor air analysis at the UK paint shop (which is located in Zone I of the psychrometric chart of Fig. 4 for the majority of the year) revealed that, due to the low temperature and moisture content of the outdoor air, the ASU necessitates heating and humidification throughout the year. On the contrary, the ARU process is less affected by Fig. 5. Integration of liquid desiccant technology in air handling units for automotive paint shop application.  A. Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 11565411the outdoor air condition. After running the simulation for the use of the liquid desiccant technology in both the ASU and the ARU, the use of the desiccant technology for ARU operation in cold climates was discarded since the air handling process in the conventional ARU is energy- efficient and the heating energy savings would be surpassed by the en-ergy costs for pumping the desiccant solution (which would require a desiccant solution flow rate of 483 L/min) and blowing the air through the wetted packing material, hindering the economic feasibility of the process. The cycle of the desiccant solution used in the 100% outdoor air ASU for paint booth operation in cold climates is illustrated in Fig. 7. The technology can operate according to the outdoor air condition in 3 operating modes:  1. Humidification operating mode: in the ASU, the solution, which is heated by the compressors’ waste heat, is used to heat and humidify Fig. 6. Flow chart of liquid desiccant ASU/ARU operation for painting process.  Fig. 7. Desiccant cycle for automotive painting operation in humidification (left) and dehumidification (right) configuration.  A. Giampieri et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Energy Conversion and Management 261 (2022) 11565412the outdoor air (becoming cooler). Following the process, additional humidification or heating may be required to supply air within the range for optimal painting. To stabilise the concentration of the so-lution, water is added. In humidification mode, the regenerator is not used.  2. Dehumidification operating mode: the solution is used in the ASU to remove the moisture from the air. The regenerator is located next to the ASU on the rooftop of the paint shop. Heat rejection (cooling tower or chilled water) is required to cool the solution before the ASU. Due to the low dehumidification demand in July in the UK, the dehumidification process can operate with a lower msol/ma ratio compared to the humidification mode.  3. The solution is stored when the outdoor air condition is in Zone III. The outdoor air is directly heated in the ASU and supplied to the paint booth. With this configuration, the desiccant solution would be able to treat the air all year-round. The simulation of performance over the course of the year was carried out to assess the variation of performance as the outdoor air condition changed. The liquid desiccant air handling unit for automotive painting in cold climates can deploy desiccant solutions with higher desorption ability, such as a low-concentrated cheap desiccant solution as a 25% wt. CaCl2 (characterised by higher humidification ability and lower regeneration temperature compared to LiCl), which is considered in the analysis and enables the use of ultra-low grade heat sources, such as the heat available from the compressed air units (872.22 kW of heat available in the form of hot water at 47 ◦C). For the design and techno-economic analysis of the novel liquid desiccant air handling unit for automotive painting application, the predictive model described in Section 2.3 was used. Table 8 summarises the simulation parameters for packing geometry and configuration, flow rates, and desiccant selection. The air flow rate of the system (50,000 m3/h) was estimated based on the available waste heat from compressed air units. The results of the simulation for different operating modes are described. Fig. 8 depicts the psychrometric chart and performance of the novel liquid desiccant ASU calculated using data from January 2017 collected every three hours [18]. As shown in Fig. 8, the low temperature and moisture content of the outdoor air (red points) is significantly increased until optimal painting isenthalpic line is reached (blue points) then followed by additional humidification (cyan points). The temperature required by the desiccant solution to perform the process in the ASU ranges between 26.2 and 44.4 ◦C, according to the outdoor air condition. In winter, the capability of the system to supply the air demand for optimal painting can signif-icantly reduce the energy consumption for heating and humidification compared to the conventional technology. The simulation showed that for points in Zone I of the psychrometric chart where enthalpy is greater than 32 kJ/kgda (observed in mild months, such as October, see Ap-pendix B) it is impossible to obtain the above-described process. In this case, the temperature of the air after the liquid desiccant process is lower than the temperature required for painting and it is required to increase the temperature of the air by an additional heating process. Fig. 9 shows the supply air produced by the liquid desiccant ASU for summer operation simulated for July 2017. As shown in the figure, there is a couple of days having higher moisture content than the target value, which requires the ability of the ASU to dehumidify the air. When dehumidification is required, the solution is cooled up to about 20 ◦C (to reduce its equilibrium vapour pressure) before entering the ASU and removing the moisture from the outdoor air. After the liquid desiccant dehumidification, additional heating is required to reach the tempera-ture required for painting (see Appendix B for a representation of the process on a psychrometric chart). Examples of this behaviour of the system are shown in days 6, 18, and 26. For the majority of the time, humidification is required (colder days or night-time) and the system operates similarly to the process shown in Fig. 8. The full results of the performance for the year 2017 are shown in Table 9, where the average temperature and moisture content of the air produced from the ASU for paint booth operation are illustrated together with the range of variation between its minimum and maximum values. As shown in Table 9, the novel liquid desiccant ASU technology is able to supply the air for optimal painting all year round. A more con-stant supply of air is observed in the coldest months, while the variation between operating modes in the hottest months results in a fluctuation of the temperature and humidity. The waste heat requirement for the process is illustrated in Fig. 10. As illustrated in the figure, the waste heat requirement for the 50,000 m3/h liquid desiccant ASU is lower than the maximum waste heat available from compressors (872.22 kW) all year. While during the period April–October the requirement is lower than the minimum duty of compressors (550 kW), additional heating (natural gas or additional waste heat sources in the plant) might be required depending on the compressed air production during the coldest days of the period November–March. In the simulated case, the energy consumption of the conventional technology for heating, cooling and humidification amounts to 2,774,673.14 kWh/y compared to the liquid desiccant sys-tem (400,094.06 kWh/y), reducing the annual energy consumption by 85.58%. 5.1.2. Hot and humid climates The analysis of the novel liquid desiccant technology for automotive painting operation is continued by the analysis of the performance of the technology in hot and humid climates such as Singapore, where both the outdoor and recirculated air require dehumidification and cooling all year round, resulting in the cycle of the desiccant proposed and illus-trated in Fig. 11. The cycle illustrated in Fig
