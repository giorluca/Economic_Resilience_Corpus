Abstract 
To adapt to impacts of climate change and variability that outwit traditional coping mechanisms, communities in 
the semi-arid Ijara, spontaneously took to pasture enterprise strategy. The spontaneity translated into unclear costs 
and benefits that impeded management of the scarce resources. The study clarified costs and benefits by isolating 
them for analysis and measuring the strategies’ viability for adaptation. The objective was to measure costs 
incurred and benefits gained from avoided damages through adoption of the strategy at community farm-level. 
Costs-benefit-analysis was the design used, complemented by the financial market-driven 15% discounting rates 
and net present values. Also co-ordinated regional downscaling experiment models were used to ascertain climate 
performance and projection. Household questionnaire was administered to 240 sample size calculated from 9000 
farmer population.  Fifty-seven per cent pastoralists had  embraced agro-pastoralism to incorporate on-farm rain-
fed Sudan grass, whose input costs were US$ 1333/ha/season with estimated yields of 1.8 tons/ha of dry matter. 
Cash flow across three rain-fed seasons netted US$21390, US$45214 and US$67820 per hectare from one, two 
and three seasons respectively. Overall net present value was US$ 2000p.a. Equal to 50.5% agro-pastoralists 
produced fodder that cushioned against the high costs on inter-county importation.  Land size inadequacy and the 
communal tenure  upset 86.26% producers  whereas 47.5%  were concerned that drought raised production costs 
the most after that lack of skills 53.08%, feed deficit at 30.41%, and diseases 20.41% in that order. Overall benefits 
from the strategy exceeded costs, making the investment viable for adaptation. Going forward and considering the 
limited adaptation capacities, disease control and feed deficit costs, policies need to focus on formulating livestock 
improvement guidelines to include revitalizing traditional grazing management practices. Other pertinent 
investment opportunities include strategic value-chain linkages and infrastructure, promotion of rain-fed and 
irrigated fodder production technologies incorporating climate-smart water harvesting, supporting post-harvest 
feed reserves technologies, reviewing land tenure system and investing in local farmer-friendly weather data 
collection and application

1. INTRODUCTION 
Over Eighty per cent of employment and 30% of Africa GDP is supported by rain fed agriculture which exposes 
the continent particularly the ASALs to the risks of high seasonal rainfall variability (Calzadilla et al., 2010; 
Commission for Africa, 2005; Tumbo et al., 2012).  A key challenge that ASALs in sub-Saharan Africa have to 
contend with is managing unreliable, highly variable, and scarce rainfall that decimate livestock feed and crop 
production (Cooper et al. 2011; Bhatt et al. 2006; Tol et al., 1998). Consequently, it is imperative that pasture 
availability and management is enhanced as grazing influence soil carbon in that, rangelands with lesser livestock 
grazing intensity have higher soil carbon stocks and vice versa (Ritchie, 2014; Bulle et al., 2014).  Given that 90% 
of emissions from agriculture emanate from enteric fermentation (GoK, 2012), pasture availability and 
management is in effect singularly the crux of the sector. The emissions global warming is essentially a green-
house-like roof effect created by the excesses of the warming gases chiefly, carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) 
and Nitrous oxide (N2O). As temperature and carbon dioxide levels change due to climate change, optimal growth 
rates for different species and composition changes with species altering their competition dynamics (Thornton et 
al., 2007).  
 
2. COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PASTURE ENTERPRISE 
Costs and benefits of producing,  harvesting, managing use and sales of livestock feed  as adaptation strategy is 
directly affected by climate change and variability given alteration occur on biomass, natural resources and 
pertinent climatic factors. Generally the greenhouse roof-effect created by the excesses of the warming greenhouse 
gases increase uncertainty in pasture production and costs (GoK, 2013; Jones et al., 1988). Specifically, rising 
temperatures increase lignification of feed tissues, reducing digestibility which leads to reduced feed available for 
livestock, and hence increased feed costs (IFAD, 2009; Thornton et al., 2007). Such changes easily affect quantity 
and quality of pasture due to changes in species population; moisture, herbaceous cover density and dry matter 
(DM) yield (Leeuw and Nyambaka, 1988). Also, the decline in mean rainfall, lead to soil moisture deficits which 
reduces DM yield and  also affect the stage of maturity for forage, all of which increase feed costs. Additionally, 
the stage of maturity at which the feed is cut is a major determinant of quality (TPS, 2013) with direct effect on

costs and benefits of the feed, which in turn may demean pastoralists’ lifestyles. To curtail rising costs and feasible 
greenhouse gas emissions, it probably is instructive that pasture availability and management is enhanced-both 
natural and on-farm.  
The realization of the pasture costs uncertainty spawned by climatic shocks, meagre resources, 
diminishing natural capital, decimation of the traditionally-relied-upon livestock industry prompted Ijara 
communities to spontaneously take to pasture enterprise as adaptation strategy. But the costs incurred and the 
benefits gained, remained unclear; which the study expounded by assessing both. The objectives were to quantify 
household-level costs of pasture enterprise and to measure benefits of avoided damages consequential to adoption 
and implementation of the strategy. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, the study answered the questions 
on what the costs of pasture enterprise were, its benefits and whether these benefits exceeded the costs 
Like other ASAL communities, pastoralists in Ijara bear the blunt of rising feed costs, as 60- 80% costs 
of livestock feeds in Kenya exceed the sum total of all other production costs (GoK, 2008; Ndungu et al., 2003). 
The high costs not only catalyze vulnerability it also affects competitiveness of Kenya’s livestock products. 
Additionally, the costs decimate capacities of the sub-sector to meet the protein demand of the burgeoning 
population and rising income per capita. The gap is further compounded by the instability of domestic supply of 
livestock feed given its dependence on the seasonality of supply of inputs. The basic factors affecting the supply 
of quality feed include its price, availability, quality of raw material used, processing methods, handling and 
storage of feeds.  Hitherto this has not only necessitated importation of fine vital feed ingredients but is complicated 
by degradation of the fragile range ecosystem hence compromising its capacity to support quality livestock in 
sufficient numbers for apt benefits and adaptive capacity.  
To raise adaptive capacities in Kenya, the national climate change response strategy (NCCRS) (2010) 
proposes developing climate-smart feeds and breed to cut down on costs of adaptation and to boost resilience. 
Also the strategy underpins promotion of diversification of economic livelihood and awareness creation among 
pastoral communities and highlights the value of balancing stocking rates with the available resources. 
Furthermore, through Vision 2030, Kenya aims to safeguard the state of environment for economic growth and to 
specifically reduce losses arising from impacts of emissions such as floods and droughts, as overall goal for the 
ASAL climatic zones (GoK, 2007).   
The country is divided into seven agro-ecological zones based on moisture index derived from annual 
rainfall expressed as a percentage of potential evaporation. Areas indexed more than 50% are considered high 
potential, useful for cropping and are designated agro-ecological zones I, II and III, and account for 20% of 
Kenya’s land mass. The other feed-limited 80% is classified as ASALs used mainly for ranching, pastoralism and 
wildlife, supporting 25% of the nation’s human population and over 70% of its livestock with an estimated value 
of US$786,516,854, (GoK, 2012; Sambroek et al., 1982; Jaetzold and Schmidt, 1983; Kabubo-Mariara et al., 
2007). Overall the significant contribution from livestock to Kenya economy is valued at US$3,460,674,157. The 
60 million national livestock populations comprise the major livestock species of 9 million Zebus, 3.5 million 
exotic and grade cattle, 8 million sheep, 11 million goats, 850,000 camels, 330,000 pigs, over 29 million chicken 
and 470,000 rabbits (GoK, 2010).   Ijara sub-county has a population of 606,212 which is 12.81% of the livestock 
totals 4,731,579 found in Garissa County (Ministry of livestock, Garissa County, 2014)  
Despite feed constraints, livestock industry is invaluable livelihood in the ASALs that are also home to 
drought adapted livestock breeds such as Somali Galla goat, Somali camel breed, Boran cattle, and the Somali-
black-head sheep (Fratkin et al., 1999).  The livestock investment is the dominant land use system in the region 
with estimated sum value of between US$250-US$ 300 million annually besides other values to include food 
security, transport, mobile bank and socio-cultural roles (Njanja, 2003; Ngutu et al., 2011; Sara, 2013). According 
to Thornton, et al.(2009) the economics and the link between climate change and livestock pasture enterprises is 
a rather neglected research area despite the vital role played by livestock in the wake of extreme weather events. 
Consequently, scanty data exist on the nexus between these climatic variables and other drivers of change in the 
wider development and livestock systems; albeit household responses to the changes vary greatly from place to 
place. For instance although temperature rise above 5.5°C  may turn farmers’ preference back to more livestock, 
a range of models predict that probability of engaging in livestock holding under a warming of 2-4°C reduces by 
7% with feeds being the chief concern (Kabubo-Mariara, 2008; IFPRI,2009). The indication is that under acutely 
high temperature that lowers feed accessibility, either due to economics or climatic factors, farmers will indistinctly 
stick to keeping livestock despite the costs involved. The indistinct, through spontaneity in undertaking pasture 
enterprise, impedes effective management of scarce resources and it was partly for that reason that the economic 
analysis on pasture enterprises adaptation strategy was justified.  
 
2.1 Adaptation in Reaction to Climate Variability 
Given the shocks arising from effects of climate change and variability in Kenya, communities, government and 
partners have over time engaged in spontaneous and planned adaptation in various sectors. Often when such 
adaptation is spontaneous, costs and benefits are not clear, which make management of the scarce resources

difficult, hence the need for the economic estimation and adaptation. For this reason an integration of best practices 
is preferable for the costs estimation as it provides better understanding of social and environment systems both 
of which are capital assets in adaptation economics (King et al., 2000; Reed et al., 2006) 
 
2.2 Adaptation to Impacts of Climate Change 
IPCC (2001) define adaptation as adjustment in natural or human systems responding to actual or expected climatic 
stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Within adaptation are many 
possible responses such as change in crop management practices, choice of fields, planting dates, crop varieties, 
livestock feeding and health (Bryan, et al, 2011). The adaptation can be carried out in response to (ex post) or in 
anticipation of (ex ante) changes in climatic conditions (IPCC, 2007) and entails a process by which measures and 
behaviours to prevent, moderate, cope with and take advantage of the consequences of climate events are planned, 
enhanced, developed and implemented (UNDP 2005; Willows, 2003 and IPCC, 2001). Dealing with climate 
change adaptation is for the present, as impacts of changing climate often demand immediate response. For this 
reason it is important that it is not separated from other development priorities but is mainstreamed into 
development planning, programs and projects (FAO, 2009; World Bank, 2008). However, it is critical to prefer 
climate-smart strategies given that responses aimed at adapting to climate change may have negative consequences 
for food security, just as methods taken to increase food security may exacerbate emissions, as discussed earlier 
(CCAFS, 2009; Jones et al., 1988).  Adaptation can be anticipatory or planned and autonomous as discussed briefly 
below:  
 
2.3 Anticipatory, Planned and Autonomous Adaptation 
Anticipatory adaptation, takes place before impacts of climate change are observed requiring conscious 
intervention to prepare for potential climate change impacts (Smith, et al., 1997). In essence, when adaptation is 
anticipated there is reduction of risk by increasing adaptive capacity and it is generally accepted that it has the 
potential to increase the marginal benefits and decrease the costs of reactive adaptation (Fankhauser, et al., 1998). 
In ASALs, for most of the cases, anticipation and planning are absent in implementation of adaptation strategies 
It is assumed that unlike in planned adaptation which is carefully planned and informed by awareness of 
potential climate change; autonomous takes place rather spontaneously (Willows et al., 2003). A key difference 
between planned adaptation and autonomous adaptation is that the former can be reactive and anticipatory – taking 
place before or after an event but autonomous is reactive.  In ASALs farmers more often than not engage in 
autonomous adaptation whose costs and benefits are too unclear to inform subsequent adaptation and policy 
direction 
 
2.4 Assessing Adaptation Costs 
Since pasture adaptation strategy in Ijara was spontaneously implemented costs remained indistinct, yearning for 
the economic assessment.  Understanding the costs of adaptation is crucial for determining levels and choice of 
investments needed to improve resilience and adaptive capacities as well as mobilizing institutional support and 
providing timely resources (Sova, et al., 2012; ADB, 2009). But the UNFCCC secretariat (2007) hold that, the 
global cost of adaptation to climate change is difficult to estimate, because climate change measures is widespread 
and heterogeneous.  In spite of this assertion the secretariat estimated that in the year 2030 the incremental 
investment and financial flows (I&FF) needed to adapt to climate change will be from $49 to $171B globally, 
from which $28-67B will be required for developing countries. Estimating the costs of adaptation is important so 
as to determine levels and choice of investments needed for adaptation.  
 
2.5 Adaptation Benefits  
The benefits from pasture were contrasted with the associated costs, including the opportunity costs; the net 
benefits the difference between the costs and benefits. Generally, the most economically efficient measure is the 
one with the highest present value of net benefit (Turner, et al., 2004).  Some adaptation measures provide public 
benefits, such as protecting coastal areas from rising sea levels, whereas many others generate more private gains 
for individuals, firms or consortia of these actors (Lunduka, et al., 2013).  Fankhauser (1997) adds that adaptation 
benefits are the value of damages avoided by adopting adaptation strategies but, IPCC (2007) equates adaptation 
benefits to avoided damage costs or accrued benefits following the adoption and implementation of adaptation 
measures. Callaway (2004) views adaptation benefits as the fraction of climate damages that are avoided by 
specific adaptation actions. However, Somda, et al. (2013) affirms that the benefits of adaptation are not limited 
to monetary but also non-monetary that contributes to the restoration of degraded ecosystems, save for residual 
damages. From the four schools of thought just discussed above it can be assumed that adaptation benefits range 
from avoided damage costs and accrued benefits following specific adaptation, and residual damages and that the 
benefits are not limited to monetary.

2.6 Assessing Impacts of Climate Change in Africa 
Climate change and variability already have serious impacts in Africa as noted in erratic rainfall, drought and 
increased temperature. IPCC assessment report (AR) 4, indicate that the total annual precipitation projections 
suggest increases by 0.2 to 0.4 per cent per year particularly along the coastline region of East Africa where Ijara 
project sites locate. However, the gains that arise from predicted increase maybe thwarted by equally rising 
temperatures (ICPAC, 2013; Ng’ang’a, 2006). The continent’s predicted effects from climate change include 
increased water stress facing more than 250 million people by 2030, crop and livestock productivity, as well 
increased pests and diseases due to changes and migration of diseases carrying pests (IPCC, 2007). Climate 
variability and droughts are already significant stressors in Africa, where rural households have adapted to the 
stressors for decades (Mortimore and Adams 2001; Mertz et al., 2009). Such rural households particularly in arid 
regions tend to spontaneous execute adaptation strategies irrespective of the prognosis from climate data (Nielsen 
and Reenberg, 2010; Sachs, 1999). However, the costs and benefits of such strategies remain indistinct particularly 
on impacts of local climatic stressors as well as their economic justification.  
 
2.7 Research Gaps 
The scarce data on assessed costs and benefits of adaptation in ASALs presented knowledge gap. Tackling this 
gap on spontaneously adopted measures needed to be thorough, incorporating culture/gender sensitivity, integrated 
assessment approach, doing it differently.  Specifically, quantifying benefits and costs was carried out building on 
bests outputs from similar works by national-global macroeconomics. Also the study conducted in-depth deductive 
interviews with local stakeholders to gain insight into the local knowledge to aid ground-truthing of scientific data 
on climatic conditions and extreme weather. In turn the approach provided for authenticity in scientific data for 
meaningful conclusions to be drawn (Chambwera, et al., 2012; Nicholles et al., 2012).  
 
3. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  
The study’s conceptual framework outlines independent variables as costs and benefits that could be clear or 
indistinct, and adaptation that could be planned and therefore sustainable or autonomous/spontaneous which is 
reactive and unsustainable. Spontaneously implemented strategies whose costs remain indistinct issue in 
adaptation being compromised and short of desired outcome. The desired ultimate phenomenon (dependent 
variables) for the pasture cost benefit analysis framework is cost-effective adaptation that is well planned and 
adopted and sustainable social welfare in Ijara. This outcome is then communicated to stakeholders as policy 
implications and feedback. In between independent and dependent variables are intervening variables which show 
the link or mechanism between costs and benefits the independent variables, and cost-effective social welfare 
adaptation. 
Also it presents interrelatedness of strategies whose costs and benefits are assessed with those that are 
not; and resultant effect from each.  In so doing it demonstrates that quantifying costs and benefits of strategies 
stimulates higher levels of adaptation and vice versa.  The costs benefits analyses (CBA) process start at identifying 
key stakeholders already affected by the changing climate and have undertaken some adaptation strategies albeit 
spontaneously. Stakeholders identified were divided into private (households, agro-pastoralists), social (fodder 
associations) public (extension and government departments) and environment (water and forest associations).  
 
4. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
4.1 Project Location 
The study sites were Bothai, Handaro and Ijara divisions in Ijara sub-county. The sites were purposefully selected 
based on vulnerability assessment carried out with stakeholders up front whose results are indicated in Table 4.1. 
The larger Ijara in Garissa County covers 11,332km² and is administratively divided into seven divisions namely 
Masalani, Ijara, Kotile, Ruqha, Sangailu, Bothai and Hulugho. It borders Fafi sub-county to the north, Lamu 
County to the south, Tana River County to the west and Republic of Somalia to the east. The sub-county is located 
between latitude 1o‚ 7` S and 2o‚ 3`S and longitudes 40o‚ 4`E and 41‚ 32` east. The sub-county is generally flat 
with Tana River on its west and the Indian Ocean and Boni forest to the south east.

4.2 Biological and Physical Attributes in Ijara 
Ijara is both arid and semi-arid and is strategically positioned between the lower River Tana riparian belt to the 
west and the expansive Boni forest to the east, both of which support pasture growth. The vegetation is generally 
acacia species of shrubs and grasses particularly star and elephant species. Nearly a quarter of the sub-county is 
covered by the forest, which is an indigenous open canopy forest that forms part of the Northern Zanzibar-
Inhamdare coastal forest mosaic.  The ecosystem is without mountains and is characterized by low undulating 
plains that have low-lying altitude ranging between 0 and 90 meters above sea level. The climatically strategic 
position, places Ijara in agro-ecological zones IV to VI gradually changing to V and VI, moving away from Boni 
forest which is influenced by coastal climate. Temperatures range from 15ºC – 38ºC and the average relative 
humidity is 68%. It is estimated that up to 1000km2 is classifiable as arable land suitable for crop agriculture. A 
section of the forest, the Boni national reserve is under the management of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) as 
a protected conservation area. Migration in the sub-county is occasioned by search for pasture during the dry 
seasons and this mainly involves movement of people and livestock to the Tana River Delta and the Boni forest 
itself where water and pasture are abundant long after the rains. 
Ijara is characterized by reddish brown to red clay-loam to clay soils. In some areas the soil is rocky, 
stony, gravelly and alluvial along the River Tana basin. These soils are mainly pulverized and acidic with high 
heavy metal toxicity and P-fixation. The main constraints in the soils are high acidity and low soil organic matter 
(Obanyi et al., 2010). Other soil types in the sub-county are grey cotton, black saline cotton, red soils and white 
sandy (FAO, 1998). The land is under communal tenure system, substantially degraded and the small-scale farming 
is mainly rain-fed with minimal irrigation along River Tana and around a few water pans. Given the ecosystem 
degradation, a key threat is depletion of soil organic matter. Decimation of the much-needed organic matter is of 
concern now that climate change will further affect its status as well as the rainfall pattern and intensity (COM, 
2009; Woomer and Swift, 1994). 
The IPCC AR4 total annual precipitation projections suggest increases by about 0.2 to 0.4 per cent per 
year particularly along the coastline region of East Africa. Kotile and Bothai project sites are expected to receive 
the peak rise in rainfall. However, the increase will be annulled by the increased evapo-transpiration resulting from 
rising temperatures.  Hence even with the potentially increased rainfall, costs of agricultural productivity and 
adaptation in Ijara may be considerably high due to possible eruption of new diseases, breakdown of the already 
weak infrastructure and soil erosion. Traditionally, long rains in Ijara occur in March to May whereas short rains

occur in October and November with the latter being the wettest season. Conversely, rainfall in the area has 
increasingly become uncertain and the trend analyzed using KMS data (40 years) period indicate a definite decline. 
Figure 2 below illustrates this decline graphically.  
 
Figure 2:  Rainfall trend 1970-2008; Ijara station 
As Figure 2 indicates, regression equation: y (rainfall amount) = -1.5965x (year number) + 530.05, where 
year 1 is 1971. For instance, rainfall total for 1982 according to the trend-line is y= (-1.5965*12) +530.05=510.9 
mm.  However, predictions from across all models indicate an upward trend in rainfall with the area becoming 
increasingly wet and humid from around year 2030. For year 2050 an increment up to 402.3 mm is expected. 
Predicted rainfall trend in Bothai, Kotile and Ijara division sites indicate a positive, rising trend.  The figure shows 
a time series analysis for rainfall both observed and simulated during twentieth to twenty-first centuries. Each 
rainy season reveals a trend toward predominantly positive precipitation anomalies in the long rains of the Twenty-
first century time series. The analysis shows presence of increased rainfall by 2030, 2050 and 2080 as compared 
to the current mean rainfall. The increment in both precipitation and temperature may augur well for productivity 
of pasture and favorable recharge in water harvesting pans. However, benefits are likely to be outsmarted by costs 
due to increased run off, new diseases, pest control costs and inaccessible markets. Recent study by IGAD Climate 
Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC) (2013) clearly shows the performance of models in projection, 
effectively reproduced the annual rainfall cycle of the Ijara sub-county. This again confirms validity of the 
observed data and the increased confidence levels since it agrees with the projected data. The synchrony in the 
data also confirms increases in precipitation and temperature and the ensuing potential costs impacts on agriculture 
productivity and on adaptation. 
Costs of climate adaptation are likely to have further positive impact as the spatial rainfall assessment 
over the sub-county confirms the presence of Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) as large scale signal 
causing the two rainfall seasonality of March April May (MAM) and October November December (OND). These 
changes in OND MAM seasons will alter agricultural calendar and productivity in Ijara given traditionally OND 
rainfall has been higher. The intensity for MAM is highest compared to OND seasons.  These projections are in 
agreement with the fourth assessment report of the IPCC (2007) which indicates that eastern Africa region will be 
wetter compared to other regions of Africa.  Overall, rainfall prediction from the downscaled climate analysis 
shows that simulations exhibit negligible dispersion from the observed. The increasing linear trend in the 
projection is probably an indicator of the sensitivity of the Ijara region’s extremes to climate change due to possible 
external enhancement of the natural climate disturbance. The disturbance and imbalanced ecosystems driven by 
human activities may result in increased flood risks and dismal agricultural productivity, hence upped costs of 
adaptation.  
 
5. RESEARCH DESIGN  
The study design was survey that used purposeful sampling to identify focus groups and expert key informants for 
in-depth investigation given both categories were especially informative on costs benefits of the adaptation 
strategies in use (Newman, 1997; Creswell, 2014). For purposes of generalization inferential statistics were used 
to make deductions and generalizations about the whole population. According to Mugenda and Mugenda (2003) 
inferential statistics handle inferences about population-based results obtained from the sample as was the case in 
the study. The results were presented in form of tables, and figures. The quantitative and qualitative interview tools 
were handy in interrogating costs and benefits of water pan, pasture and aloe crop adaptation strategies. Cost 
benefit analysis was used to compare the present value of a stream of benefits to a stream of costs. These values 
were discounted to calculate the present value of future costs and benefits. Adaptation costs quantified were those 
on planning, land preparation, fencing, seeding and labour, whereas adaptation benefits were water for domestic  
and livestock use, incomes from sale of agricultural products around Handaro water pan and time saved from

trekking far for water which is invested in other economic pursuits.   
Cost benefit analysis complemented by NPV tools were the main methods to tap into Ijara stakeholders’ 
knowledge on how climate change in their environment has impacted agricultural output. Where costs or benefits 
did not have monetary values, contingence valuation method was used to compare non-monetary values of the 
strategies. Costs Benefit Analysis was used to identify, quantify and to add all the positive factors (benefits), and 
did the same on the negative ones and then subtract all the negatives (costs) with the difference between the two 
advising on viability of the adaptation strategies (Chambwera et al, 2012; McDonald, 2009). The net present value 
(NPV) is an indicator on economic viability of a project. The higher the value on the indicator, the more viable a 
strategy is. Also CORDEX models and climatic data prediction from Kenya Met Services (KMS) were used to 
predict how the changing climate and variability will impact on costs and benefits of strategies implemented and 
their viability prospects. Five to Ten years were used as the medium term planning period, being the phase in 
which it is expected that the cash inflows will outgrow the recurrent costs and provide desirable returns. 
 
6. SAMPLING AND SAMPLE SIZE 
A list of smallholder pasture farmers were developed by first reviewing records from respective agriculture and 
livestock departments from which sampling frame was generated. Subsequently, sample sizes were calculated 
proportionate to the number of farmers on the compiled list and random sampling was used to obtain a sub-sample 
for each of the sites (Osotimehin et al., 2006; Nimoh et al., 2012). A total of 240 respondents were involved in the 
study and primary data were collected through key informants, focused group discussion and household interviews 
using a structured questionnaire. Secondary data were collected from government departments, UN agencies and 
NGOs using document review mode (Thrusfield, 1986; Weiss, 1998).  The sample was arrived at using a table 
developed by applying the formulae for determining sample sizes for known populations as shown below (The 
NEA Research Bulletin, 1960; Neuman, 1997): The formula discussed was used to determine the sample size 
drawn from a finite population of 9000 households in Ijara: 
 =
	(1 − 	)
( − 1) + 	(1 − 	)
 
 Where:   
X2 is the value of chi-square @DF=1 for desired confidence level for 0.10 =2.71 
N is the population size which in this case is 9000 households 
P population proportion (assumed to be 0.50) 
D is the degree of accuracy (expressed as a proportion) 
For purposes of the analysis, the following values were used for the parameters in the formulae 
a. Took the value of the chi square(X2) at degrees of freedom =1 at the desired confidence interval of 0.10 
which when looked up at the  Chi square distribution table yields 2.71 
b. In addition  N was considered; being the population under study, that is 9000 households actively engaged 
in farming  
c. Took the population proportion to be 0.50 
d. The degree of accuracy expressed as a proportion, was calculated as 0.00523. Given the above values, the 
following was arrived at: 
 =
2.7190000.5(1 − 0.5)
0.0523(9000 − 1) + 2.710.5(1 − 0.5)
 
=
2.7190000.50.5
0.00274	8999 + 0.677
 
=

Of the 13,180 households in Ijara; only 9000 actively engage in either livestock or crop farming. Given the sample 
population is 9000, sample size n=240 households, for the selected sites in Handaro, Ijara and Bothai were 
purposefully drawn assigning 80 households per site. Random sampling was then applied to select the 80 
households from total population of each of the three sites. 
 
7. DATA INSTRUMENTATION 
Structured questionnaires were administered to 240 pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in Bothai, Ijara and Handaro 
divisions of the larger Ijara sub-county. The questionnaire development procedure was a kin to works by Thrusfield 
(1986) and Osotimehin et al. (2006) and included open and closed-ended types of questions. Concrete responses

in the questionnaires were subjected to descriptive statistics allowing for illustrative tables, charts, graphs and 
diagrams to depict some trends of the findings. This was done to enhance qualitative analysis and presentation. 
For secondary data records of accounts were sourced from the National Drought Management Authority, Ministry 
of Agriculture and Livestock, Ijara, Ministry of Water and Irrigation and reviewed. 
 
8. DATA PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS 
8.1 Study variables 
The variables in the study were costs, benefits and adaptation (independent variables). The desired phenomenon 
(dependent variable) was sustainable social welfare and upped resilience. In between independent and dependent 
variables were intervening variables that showed linkage between the two variables. Along the variables, data was 
collated and so analyzed. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) and Excel software packages were used to 
analyzed the data.  The methodology used to calculate economic returns was cost benefit analysis (CBA) 
employing the net present value (NPV) tool to show strategy viability. The cost benefit analysis was used as a 
standard method decision tool to guide resource allocation, impacts assessment, comparability of costs and benefits, 
as they are expressed in monetary terms and the value they present to the community (Commonwealth of Australia, 
2006). The objective was to compare the present value of a stream of benefits to a stream of costs. Discounting 
was used to calculate the present value of future costs and benefits. Evaluation was based on net present value 
(NPV). Essentially use of the economic analysis to include environmental cost benefit analysis assessed the 
impacts of interventions on the economics to determine whether the intervention contributed to social welfare. 
Market prices were discounted by 15% to take care of distortions due to market fluctuations. 
The study used the Krutilla and Fisher model Krutilla, (1975) to interrogate the cost-benefit analysis 
(CBA) through the net present value to determine whether the three strategies’ costs would be profitable compared 
to the baseline or “without the adaptation” or “alternative intervention”. Building on works by Myers, et al., (2005) 
the cash flows were discounted at the market rate as appropriate cost of capital as follows: 
	 =  +
C!
(1 + ")!
+
C
(1 + ")
…+
C$
(1 + ")$
 
Where NPV= Net present value  
CFo, CF1, CF2… CF n, are the cash flows (Monetary costs-Monetary benefits) for periods t=0, 1, 2… n 
                K=the discounting factor also known as the opportunity cost of capital. 
NPV = Present Value of future cash flows – Investment 
NPV Decision Rule: If NPV ≥ 0 then investment in a strategy is considered viable and acceptable 
The study sought to unveil the costs and benefits from livestock feed enterprises, water pans and aloe crop and to 
relate them to the awareness level to the overall climate change adaptation. The following financial indicators were 
evaluated for the adaptation: 
i. Cash flow was used as a measure of the balance between revenues and costs, with appropriate accounting for 
depreciation and liabilities. The discount rate used was 15% being the prevailing interest rate in the financial 
markets which rates decline over time (Myers et al., 2005); 
ii. Net present value (NPV) tool was used being the sum of revenues and costs over time, based on an assumed 
discount rate, referenced to the present (the first year); 
iii. Payback period factored in was 5 to 10 years being the period in which it is expected that the cash inflows 
will outgrow the recurrent costs and provide desirable returns for the investment.  
 
9. STUDY RESULTS  
9.1 Vulnerability, Risk Assessment and Identification of Strategies 
To identify adaptation strategies in a participatory manner, a rapid vulnerability assessment was conducted 
followed by adaptation options selection at the pre-field phase of the study. The assessment aimed to establish 
household vulnerability levels resulting from climate change and variability and what adaptation strategies best 
suited the scenario. Household vulnerability assessment was conducted using questionnaires and focus discussions 
tools. Farmers in the three project sites concurred on the following; 1) rainfall had declined and become more 
erratic both in intensity and spatial 2) temperature was on positive trend, frequent and prolonged droughts 
threatened agriculture livestock productivity 3) wind direction was increasingly unpredictable and affected rainfall 
distribution or  its failure altogether (Table 1). Identification of water harvesting pans, pasture and aloe crop as 
adaptation options were finalized in a participatory manner based on the vulnerability assessment results. Other 
considerations included the economic study timelines, viability of the identified options as well as costs and 
benefits.  
As results on Table 1 show, rainfall was of greatest concern in all the sites due to its reduction, increased 
intensity and sporadic but slightly increased precipitation. The unpredictable rainfall pattern occasioned flooding 
and drought that impacted adversely on Ijara ecosystems issuing in decimation of crop and livestock. Similarly the 
results show unpredictable wind direction which explained inter alia erratic rainfall scenario.

9.2 Socio-Economic Characteristics 
Farmers’ responses were solicited using a questionnaire in which their socio-economic profile was sought. It was 
necessary to assess aspects of the socioeconomic background of the farmer given it influences reaction to impacts 
of climate change and farm productivity levels (Onil, 2010). Consequently, it was vital to understand their socio-
economic characteristics and the inter-play across them in relation to costs and benefits of adaptation. The variables 
assessed were gender, household size, length of stay, relationship of the respondents to the household heads and 
source of livelihoods.  
 
9.3 Significance of Pasture as Adaptation Strategy 
As shown on Table xxx, Ijara sub-county livestock populations were 606,212 which are 12.81% of the total 
4,731,579 in Garissa County. With a rating 47.5%, drought that decimated livestock feed was cited as the threat 
of concern in animal production. Farmers’ views were solicited on what costs and benefits were for purchasing 
and feeding one calf to maturity under scarce-feed scenario. To determine whether there was significant difference 
between costs and benefits of enterprises along livestock nurture continuum, a paired”t’– test was used. The results 
indicated significant difference between monetary costs and monetary benefits on labour at US$ 16 with benefits 
being higher. Also costs of purchasing calf for feed-test were outwitted by benefits at US$14. 
 
Figure 3: Threats to livestock production 
A comparison between costs of treatment and benefits posted US$1020 which was balanced by benefits in other 
activities’ returns.

(2007). In relation to this the study advocated for those cost-lines whose marginal benefits exceed marginal costs. 
And while doing this, the researcher appreciated that a– pre-climate change scenario in the region cannot be fully 
restored as in every adaptation effort there would be residue damage as seen in (Fankhauser, 2009) and World 
Bank (2010). Faced with the extreme weather events and markets being elusive, a key solution to livestock feed 
deficits is pasture production using suitable grass species and viable seeds from reliable dealers. Apart from natural 
pastures, the study assessed on-farm Sudan grasses (a kin to sorghum) as they are known for being drought resistant, 
and are more efficient in water absorption because they have many secondary roots per unit of primary root and 
have a small leaf area for reduction of evaporation. In addition, the grasses have the ability to go dormant for 
extended drought periods with growth resuming with the re-appearance of rains 
 
9.5 Types of pasture and Impacts on their dwindle over time in Ijara 
Types of pasture in the area, shrubs occupy 58.33%, grasses to include rain-fed on farm Sudan grass 27.08% while 
others occupied 14.58% of the pastureland (Table 3). The current standing pasture was insufficient for most of the 
seasons and 86.26% farmers indicated pasture size was small and inadequate. Most of the pastures are natural.

9.6 Economic Analysis of Livestock Feeds and Threats to Production 
Pasture and as adaptation strategy is critical given the economic livelihood of the Ijara inhabitants is livestock 
keeping with 90% of the population directly engaged in it either solely or alongside other enterprises ( GoK, 2008). 
To lower costs of production and cope with changing climate and variability, pastoralists have in the past 
spontaneously taken to adaptation options such as livestock types to include indigenous cattle, sheep and goats, 
Boran Galla goats, black-head Somali sheep (District Development Plan, Ijara, 2008-2012). However, only a paltry 
22% indicated that they store livestock feed (Table 4). The gap created by failure to store feed is attributable partly 
to the close proximity of the community to the expansive Boni forest which acts as feed reserve but also fails to 
lower costs of production as it has high infestation with tsetse fly (Gure Sadiq, personal communication, 2013).

Missing System 20 8.3

The infestation alludes to the necessity to produce and conserve pasture for local consumption and for sale as 
adaptation strategy. A key threat to the free range grazing is that pasture costs ends up increased as it is denuded 
with little consideration for ecosystem’s carrying capacity (Tserendash, 2006). 
 
9.7 Economic analysis Vis a Vis Pasture carrying capacity   
Pasture carrying capacity (PCC) consideration is critical in livestock sector chiefly because it denotes the 
maximum number of animals that can graze on particular pasture throughout the season without decimating it or 
denying posterity (GoK, 2007). Failure to factor-in PCC raises costs of adaptation in the medium and long term as 
it fails to ensure sufficient residual feed for re-growth for subsequent year. A key benefit from being PCC 
compliant is that residual feed conserves soil erosion thereby increasing yield per unit area by improving stand 
vigour, moisture and nutrient re-cycling. (Tserendash, 2006) Tserendash (2006) developed a formula to aid 
understanding of the relationship between benefits of being PCC compliant discussed as follows: 
Carrying	Capacity = Annual	Seasonal	Forage	Production	 × Utilization	Rate
Average	Daily × Length	of	Intake	Grazing	Season
 
Although it was beyond the study ambit to apply the pasture carrying capacity formula, its application is useful in 
teasing out stock rates versus available pasture.  Consideration of PCC  mitigate for threats that increase costs of 
adaptation as indicated in the study to include diseases, lack of feeds, drought and predators. Of these four, 45.83% 
of the households felt that drought raises costs production the most, followed by lack of feeds 30.41% and diseases 
20.41% in that order. The shocks echo the need for increased pasture enterprises as adaptation strategies as it does 
lower costs of livestock production and increase multiple benefits from incomes and livestock products.

9.8 Economic Analysis of Alternative Livelihood Options 
As Figure 4 indicates, livestock forms the basic livelihood of the study population. The other alternative livelihoods 
are, crop farming, honey and small and medium enterprises. A comparison between costs and benefits of the 
livelihoods 10 and 5 years ago and present indicated a steady decline of benefits from them all but for small 
medium businesses. The decline implied that the sunken costs on spontaneously implemented coping measures, 
chiefly, livestock and convention crops are not easily recoverable. This underscores the necessity of strategies in 
this study in form of enhanced water harvesting pans, aloe crop and pasture, all done differently. Otherwise, the 
trend would increase costs of adaptation that issue in undesirable effects particularly in a dry area where 
communities have traditionally relied on livestock.  
 
Figure 4: Contribution from alternative sources of livelihoods 
Economic Analysis of Pasture Production Costs 
Up to 51.67% agro-pastoralists produced fodder whereas 48.33% depended on fodder sourced from outside the 
region for their livestock. In view of the high costs discussed earlier, this response indicates dire need for the 
pasture enterprise as adaptation strategy to cushion almost half the farmer population from the high costs. The 
study specified that benefits worth US$21390, US$45214 and US$67820 per hectare from one, two and three 
seasons respectively of pasture production per year is attainable and to be preferred. The pasture was mainly rain-
fed Sudan grass grown on-farm locally. As indicated on (Figure 5) the present value of the pastures in three 
production seasons rise steeply from US$1216 which represents the initial capital outlay and peaks at year two 
before gently reducing exponentially to the tenth year.  The curve change represent the time value of money, i.e. 
a shilling received today is more than a shilling received later. Time value of money was captured by interest rates 
which were the cost of capital i.e. maximum benefit or value was realized at year two when the costs outlay was 
balanced by an equally appealing cash inflow. 
Beyond year two, the pasture revenue streams, though equal in nominal values to earlier streams, are 
reduced in value through the discounting factor and reduce in real value thus the gentle slope observed in the graph.

Data obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and livestock, Ijara indicate that to process and store fodder entail 
construction of hay processing and storage shed (unit used is US$) 2222 procurement of simple mechanical hay 
bale 555, capacity building 555.  As indicated on Table 7, the costs of nurturing one calf bought at 91 and analyzed 
in this study is 60. Other costs incurred in raising the calf are pest control 79 labour 80 and treatment Kshs 64.

Apart from capital costs, feed costs were overall high indicating that the pasture enterprise is the timely 
adaptation strategy as it saves livestock farmers from exorbitant costs. Also the strategy cushions the farmers from 
gaps in fodder supply that occur during drought. The prevailing fodder prices on the local market were used in the 
analysis. The stream of costs in the rain-fed on-farm Sudan grass included land preparation, fencing, seed and 
seeding, plough and data collation whereas benefits values analyzed were increased incomes and livelihoods both 
monetary and non-monetary.  Moreover, the ‘without strategy’ scenario is that costs of fodder exceeded benefits, 
again demonstrating invaluableness of pasture strategy to ameliorate the high costs.  Despite the initial high capital 
costs that tapers off in the second year onwards, pasture enterprise was found economically viable and an apt 
adaptation strategy.  
Costs benefits structure factored-in capital costs (initial costs, annual operational/maintenance costs and 
livestock death and pasture deficits. Benefits included income from sale of hay bales and livestock and livestock 
products sales. The total (nominal) costs were incurred on land preparation for pasture , procurement of farm inputs,  
field management harvesting, processing inputs,  transport  and labour US$ 2385  Procurement of fodder 
processing equipment, construction of hay baling and storage shed US$ 3333 and capacity building US$ 2222. All

these were discounted at the prevailing financial markets rates of 15%.  As probable in discounted rates, the curve 
on these initial costs (capital costs) dipped significantly after the first year and in turn benefits steadily rose from 
year one progressively. But as NPV (present value of future cash flow) below show, due to dipping of the future 
net value of the shilling, the benefits normalized after the initial rise. Non-monetary benefits included healthy 
livestock: Status symbol, manure for crop, mobile bank, carrier, security and dowry. Given the feed can last for 
five years under good maintenance in order to supply the same level of economic benefits, the analysis considered 
the cash flows for a five year period - applying the NPV formulae:

NPV=US$2000 Table 8 show discounting rate application, cash in-flow and out-flow and resulting net present 
value of the pasture investment In this case the NPV is greater than 0 implying that benefits from the livestock 
feed enterprises  exceed costs, making the investment worthwhile as adaptation strategy. Cash inflow was 
US$14444 whereas cash outflow was US$ 1202.  
 
DISCUSSION 
The study quantified costs and benefits of livestock pasture enterprises considering a 5-10 year period for cash 
flow, being the period in which the feeds can last under good maintenance in order to supply the same level of 
economic benefits. Also it was clear that the strategy takes place under harsh extreme weather condition, chiefly 
drought. But persuasion to tackle the problem was that production of livestock feed, particularly the budding on-
farm grasses will be much more feasible once costs and benefits are clear. Feed production and management aim 
to cushion the vulnerable communities from exorbitant costs which exceed the sum total of outside-sourced 
feedstock. From the study it was clear that the high costs of production, not only affect competitiveness of Kenya’s 
livestock products particularly at the international market, but also makes it difficult for the community to plan 
and manage scarce resources in a bid to adapt. But livestock feed enterprises emerged economically viable. 
 
CONCLUSION 
The study clarified that economic development initiatives are central part of adaptation requiring mainstreaming 
climate change data and practice into development through different approaches, not business as usual. Also, it is 
critical to invest in human capital and competent institutions that focus on enhancing resilience and tackling roots 
of poverty starting with low regret options.  Equally vital is tackling weather risks that already stress people and 
ecosystems such as drought by investing in enhanced strategic water harvesting and poverty reduction technologies 
for if not, climate change will compound drought risks, raising costs even higher. And while at it, consider hard 
adaptation (undertaking actual options) and soft adaptation e.g. awareness creation as one entity given the two 
complement each other and should spread concurrently. The conclusions are vital for the study area now that 
adaptation strategy was found economically viable but required home-grown capital-generating initiatives, done 
differently.  Overall, the findings clarified that ASALs are water stressed and that Ijara epitomize this stress more 
readily in form of incessant drought which in turn increases vulnerability to drought in an endless vicious cycle. 
But as results indicate, adaptation reduces vulnerability and increases resilience. Consequently, investing in proven

economically viable adaptation makes strong economic sense, even in unpredictable ecosystem conditions and 
uncertainty. In order to create lasting impact for drought-affected communities, it is imperative that actors work in 
concert to build long term resilience, in line with National Climate Change Response Strategy and Kenya’s Vision 
2030’s disaster preparedness and capacity development, dove-tailing into pertinent international protocols. This is 
especially important because onset of drought only comes to exacerbate existing development weakness. The study 
results become a handy tool for policy formulation guided by the clarity on costs and benefits established. 
Specifically, pasture strategy was found economically viable for adaptation both in the current rain-fed 
250-500mm conditions and beyond 2030 when precipitation may increase. For way forward value-for-money 
policy guidelines, the study implore county government to formulate livestock improvement guidelines towards: 
revitalizing traditional grazing management practices to tackle limited adaptation capacities, disease control and 
feed deficit costs. The preferable climate-smart approach requires investment in strategic value-chain linkages, 
viable markets acquisition and apt infrastructure. Also it is critical to promote strategic rain-fed and irrigated fodder 
production technologies using certified seeds and incorporating climate-smart water harvesting. Given the 
predicted increased precipitation in Ijara 2030 onwards, it is crucial to enrich soil stabilization by using multi-
benefits crops such as Aloe and climate-adaptable pastures types as well as, supporting post-harvest/feed reserves 
technologies. To encourage the rising number of agro-pastoralists to sustainably invest in pasture farming, it is 
cost-effective to review land tenure system towards permanent ownership rights and to incorporate promotion of 
local farmer-friendly weather data collection and use.
