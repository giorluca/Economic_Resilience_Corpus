An assessment of rural road network resilience as a critical infrastructure for coal seam gas development in regional Queensland

i  University of Southern Queensland Faculty of Health, Engineering, and Sciences  AN ASSESSMENT OF RURAL ROAD NETWORK RESILIENCE AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR COAL SEAM GAS DEVELOPMENT IN REGIONAL QUEENSLAND  A dissertation submitted by Samuel Jesse Fitzgerald  In fulfilment of the requirements of  ENG4111 and ENG4112 Research Project  Towards the degree of  Bachelor of Engineering Honours (Civil)      Submitted: 29th October 20151  ABSTRACT The Coal Seam Gas (CSG) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) extraction and export industry forms a large part of the Australian Resource Sector, a driving force in the national economy. Given the nature of these industries, the vast majority of the development associated is located in rural and regional Australia. With these developments comes a significant increase in the volume of traffic, and the percentage of commercial vehicles expected to utilise the local road networks.  The local infrastructure networks in these areas have often been designed and constructed to cater to low volumes of traffic and as such will usually consist of a pavement and formation only, with little in the way of drainage infrastructure. This existing asset class leaves these roads and associated road networks vulnerable to heavy rainfall events and flood events, with these roads often suffering significant damage and requiring a substantial amount of repair work be undertaken before the road is returned to the regular level of service. As a result these networks are extremely susceptible to damage and disruption during flood events.   Following the significant damage caused to infrastructure networks in Queensland during the major Flood events of Tropical cyclones Tasha and Anthony in 2011, and Ostwald in 2013, the resilience of transportation networks during and after major flood events has come into consideration. Many communities were isolated during the flood events and many assets were not returned to full service for periods of up to 2 years following the initial event. This disruption of the transportation network not only caused physical damage to the network, but is estimated to have cost the Queensland economy in excess of $15.7Billion. (Easdown, 2011). This research project aims to investigate the resilience to flooding of the local road network in the Wandoan Region of Queensland, Australia and the expected economic impacts on local CSG developments as a result of this level of resilience.  To meet the research objectives of this project, a literature review was undertaken to determine existing frameworks for the quantification of network resilience. From this study the Networked Infrastructure Resilience Assessment (NIRA) Framework developed by (Omer, et al., 2013) was selected as the most appropriate and suitable method of analysis.   2  The NIRA framework was applied to model the resilience of the Western Downs Regional Council’s (WDRC) Wandoan West Road Network during a flood event of 2011 event magnitude, and assess the financial implications of this resilience on local Coal Seam Gas (CSG) Development in the area. This was undertaken by the application of forecast traffic data provided by CSG Developers, and historic damage information collected by WDRC in delivery of the 2011 flood damage recovery program.  This initial analysis provided a benchmark level of performance against which the impact of proposed upgrades would be measured. This initial analysis identified three major links in the network as having the most potential for financial loss due to decreased level of performance following a flood event, with a cumulative cost per day to developers of $4,913.16.  Using this analysis as a benchmark of existing network performance, a series of proposed upgrades were modelled by reducing the impact of recorded defects on the network in accordance with the proposed upgrade type. The impact of these upgrades was shown in a decreased cumulative cost per day of $1,985.43. This relatively minor saving per day has the potential to save CSG developers millions of dollars in lost production and increased travel costs over the extended period to full network recovery.  From the comparison of these analyses, a number of conclusions regarding factors which may influence link resilience were drawn, and potential improvements and further work to the analysis were discussed. The analysis performed was determined to be a useful tool for identifying and quantifying vulnerable links in a road network, but collection of more detailed data would be required to have full confidence in the financial impacts calculated.

Such events have become more common recently as demonstrated by the significant flood events caused by Tropical Cyclones Tasha and Anthony in 2011, and Tropical Cyclone Ostwald in 2013. Both of these events resulted in significant flooding across the state of Queensland, and resulted in restoration and upgrade works to government infrastructure networks in excess of $13 Billion (Queensland Reconstruction Authority, 2014).  As a result of this and other international events, much attention has been given to the investigation of resilience in infrastructure and how relevant techniques can be implemented at all stages of the asset life cycle to increase the network resilience to shocks and disruptions. In order to accomplish this, an understanding of the current level of resilience held by a network is necessary. There are currently a number of frameworks which aim to assess the level of resilience of a transport network. These include the Networked Infrastructure Resiliency Assessment (NIRA) frame work (Omer, et al., 2013), the framework proposed by (Bruneau, et al., 2003) for the quantitative assessment of the seismic resilience of communities, and the Three-Stage Resilience Analysis Framework developed by (Ouyang, et al., 2012). In addition to the level of service provided by transport networks, it is also important to consider the many underlying economic factors which may indicate the priority of a particular road asset. These may include industries supplied by or dependant on the network, access of landowners to health and other services, and in the case of local government the asset owner’s responsibility to landowners and the public. As with any government organisation, intense scrutiny is placed upon local government when assessing and funding any capital works project. The use of public money and the constant consideration of political agenda requires all financial decisions be thoroughly evaluated and the most cost effective solution chosen. This constant review, coupled with a  15  vested public and economic interest in a fully functional transportation network means that while upgrades to the road network are essential, all options must be fully evaluated in order to ensure best value in the use of public funds.  The Western Downs Regional Council’s (WDRC) local road network was severely affected by the 2011 and 2013 flood events. These events resulted in extensive damage to the unsealed roads portion of the network, as well as significantly damaging much of the drainage infrastructure in the region. This damage resulted in isolation of remote rural communities and severe restriction of local primary industries.  The failure of these rural road networks during these flood events has highlighted the need for significant network upgrades in order to improve flood immunity and increase network flood resilience. However to accomplish this with the limited budget available to most rural Councils a thorough and detailed analysis of the current resilience of the network is required. From this the best value for money options can be selected for further investigation and possible inclusion in future capital works budgets. In addition to funding of upgrades with the use of Local Government’s capital works budget, significant external funding is available to Council in areas with a high amount of Coal Seam Gas development activity, such as the Wandoan region of the Western Downs Regional Council. This funding is provided by the resource company developing the area as a means of offsetting the impact that construction and operation traffic caused by the development would have on the existing road network. However, to gain access to this funding Council must be able to identify the benefits to the Resource Company provided by the proposed upgrades. An analysis of road network resilience, and the potential loss savings to the resource company in a flood event, would provide a clear justification for the full or partial funding of proposed road upgrades.     16  RESEARCH OBJECTIVES This project proposes to undertake an analysis of the WDRC Local Road Network in the Western Wandoan region, which is currently being developed by both QGC and Origin Energy for the extraction, compression, and transport of liquefied natural gas. As a direct result of this development, traffic volumes in this remote rural area have increased dramatically. Due to this increase WDRC has put conditions on both companies to significantly upgrade Bundi Road, which connects the surrounding region to the Jackson-Wandoan Road and through this the Warrego highway which links southeast Queensland to Brisbane.  It is proposed through the analysis of the existing network, to determine the resilience of Bundi Road and surrounding roads to flood events, and through this the financial implications a disruption to this network would have on the CSG industry development in the area. From this analysis a series of recommended road upgrades would be modelled, and the network reanalysed with these proposed upgrades in place. This will provide a difference in expected financial loss during a flood event, which may then be compared to the estimated cost of the proposed upgrades in order to determine the value for money posed by construction of these flood mitigation measures.     17  OVERVIEW OF DISSERTATION This paper contains six chapters which broadly define the different section of this research project. A summary of these is given below.  Introduction A brief introduction to the consideration of infrastructure resilience, a summary of recent flood events and the need to consider resilience to flooding developed from this, and the specific considerations relating to infrastructure resilience in the West Wandoan region of the Western Downs Regional Council area.  Literature Review A review of the existing literature regarding the study and evaluation of a network’s resilience to disruptions, an overview of the existing condition of the West Wandoan road network, and an overview of the impacts of recent flood events on this network.  Methodology A detailed investigation into the methodology required to meet the report objectives, including data collection and review techniques, boundary conditions for selection of data, an assessment of project risks, identification of required resources, and the project schedule. Network Analysis The development of the network model from the collected asset data, and analysis of this network using historic flood recovery data collected. A second iteration will then be completed to analyse potential benefits and savings due to a series of proposed upgrades.  Discussion Comparison of the network analysis results to identify trends in the data, and draw conclusions based on correlations between the virtual network and the physical network.  Conclusions Review of the results if the network analysis as well as the proposed upgrades will identify areas of concern in the existing network which may benefit the network as a whole by upgrade.     18  1 LITERATURE REVIEW 1.1 INTRODUCTION Resilience in regards to infrastructure networks refers to the response of the network to severe and catastrophic shock, such as natural disasters and flood events, and the network’s ability to continue to meet an acceptable level of service during and after these events (Omer, et al., 2013). Such events have become more common recently as demonstrated by the significant flood events caused by Tropical Cyclone Anthony and Tasha in October 2010 and February 2011, and Tropical Cyclone Ostwald in 2013. Both of these events resulted in significant flooding across the state of Queensland, and resulted in restoration and upgrade works to government infrastructure networks in excess of $13 Billion (Queensland Reconstruction Authority, 2014).  As a result of this and other international events, much attention has been given to the investigation of resilience in infrastructure and how relevant techniques can be implemented at all stages of the asset life cycle to increase the network resilience to shocks and disruptions. In order to accomplish this, an understanding of the current level of resilience held by a network is necessary. 1.2 RESILIENCE AND THE RELEVANCE TO THE MODERN WORLD Due to the significant network disruption and cost associated with recovery caused by natural disasters and acts of terrorism in the modern world, much focus has been given to enhancing the ability of these networks to function adequately and recovery quickly from these disruptions.  (Bruneau, et al., 2003) defines community seismic resilience as “the ability of social units (e.g. organisations, communities) to mitigate hazards, contain the effects of disasters when they occur, and carry out recovery activities in ways that minimise social disruption and mitigate the effects of future earthquakes. While (Ouyang, et al., 2012) defines resilience as the joint ability of infrastructure systems to resists (prevent and withstand) any possible hazards, absorb the initial damage, and recover to normal operation. For the purposes of this paper, resilience in regards to regional transportation networks will be defined as the ability of the network to reduce the occurrence of disruptive events, minimise the network  19  disruption due to these events, and recover to an adequate level of service in a reasonable and effective timeframe following these event.  Resiliency in urban areas may mean a disruption in the level of service provided to road users, while in a regional or remote area, a disruption may mean isolation from necessary services for short or long periods of time. The primary reason for this is the lower class of asset commonly found in these regional areas. The lower class of asset is justified due to the cost of construction compared to the number of expected users. The compromise in this reduced minimum level of service is the increased vulnerability of these roads to flood and heavy rainfall events. With Construction traffic for Phase 2 QGC developments in the Wandoan Area expected to be greatly in access of the low traffic volumes the roads usually cater too, the potential for loss due to a flood event is substantially higher, drawing attention to the resiliency or lack there of, of this network to flood events.   1.3 THE WANDOAN WEST ROAD NETWORK This section of the literature review is intended to give a brief overview of the Wandoan West Road Network, particularly the area in the region of the proposed and existing CSG developments. This summary will provide an understanding of the current state of the road network in this area, the current level of service offered, and the susceptibility of the network to flood events.  1.3.1 Network Overview and Boundary The Wandoan Local Road Network consists of approximately 518.1km of road, of which 199.8km is sealed and 318.3km unsealed (Moloney Systems, 2011). Due to the scarcity of quality granular pavement materials in the local area, this proportion of sealed to unsealed roads is higher than would be expected in most regional areas, as the cost to supply pavement material often means that sealing a road provided lower whole of life costs than gravel resheeting.  For the purpose of this paper, the network to the west of Wandoan, north of Bundi Road, and east of the Roma-Taroom Road will be considered. This portion of the road network will be referred to as the Wandoan West Road Network (WWRN). This portion of the network can be seen in figure 1.1 below. This image is extracted from Appendix A – Wandoan Rural Surface Type.  20   Figure 1.1 - Wandoan West Road Network extents These network extents were chosen for the primary reason being that this area, specifically the south-western section, is the major centre for CSG development in the Wandoan Area and because of this is the area planned for major upgrades of the road network. This provided the motive for selecting the region, while the network boundary was chosen as it encompasses the area between three major arterial roads, being Roma-Taroom Road to the west, Jackson-Wandoan Road to the south, and the Leichardt Highway to the east. These three roads link the major population centres of the region, as well as linking the region to the Warrego Highway which provides access to south-east Queensland, and the cities of Toowoomba and Brisbane. Due to this the majority of labour, plant, and materials to be used in all development in the area will use one of these roads to access the region. Effectively, the WWRN shown encompasses a subsection of the network with these three arterial roads providing access to the larger network.  1.3.2 Current Network Conditions As shown in Appendix A – Wandoan Rural Surface Type, and the extra figure 1.1, much of the key sections of the WWRN are sealed bitumen surfaces (shown in blue), with links  21  between these sealed roads often being unsealed (shown in brown), or formation only (shown in green) meaning the road is formed of insitu material only. 1.3.2.1 Existing Road Surface Types Of the sealed sections of road, the bitumen seal width ranges between 4 and 8 meters, depending on the traffic volume and composition, and road hierarchy. A seal width of 4 meters is suitable for use by a single vehicle at a time only, with approaching traffic being forced to partially leave the sealed surface in order to pass safely. This causes wearing of the road shoulder, and in wet weather conditions can prove hazardous to traffic, particularly heavy commercial vehicles which can cause severe deformation of the road shoulder under these conditions. Figure 1.2 below illustrates well typical shoulder damage to a sealed road due to trafficking of unsealed shoulders during wet weather.  Figure 1.2 – Example of a typical rural road with sealed surface of 6 meter width (Bungaban Road, Wandoan) The unsealed roads in the Wandoan Road Network typically have a pavement width of 5 to 6 meters. The pavement is constructed of a crushed granular material, typical to the region  22  is crushed laterite, and is intended to provide a high strength trafficable surface without the additional construction cost of a bitumen seal. These roads typically experience only local traffic of low volume, such as that shown of the rural feeder in WDRC Standard Drawing for Roads in Appendix E, and are often capable of an operating speed of between 80 and 100km/h dependant on road geometry. An extract of this is shown below. These unsealed roads require more frequent maintenance than sealed roads, often requiring grading annually or bi-annually, and requiring a resheet of gravel material every 15 years (Moloney Systems, 2011). These roads will be trafficable to a reasonable extent in periods of wet weather, though may become slippery requiring a reduction in operating speed. Often heavy vehicles will be unable to traffic these roads during extended periods of wet weather, or if trafficking these roads, will often cause significant damage to the road due to deformation and rutting of the pavement.    Figure 1.3 - Extract Appendix E, Typical Road Cross Sections (WDRC) The figure 1.4 below is an excellent illustration of the potential vulnerabilities of a pavement only road. This photo of Old Chinchilla Road was taken during delivery of 2013 Flood Damage restoration works. Note the road surface seems to be in good condition and suitable for the traffic volume of the road, however in the invert shown approximately half way along this section, moisture has penetrated and weakened the pavement resulting in failure. The darker material would indicate that the insitu subgrade has been forced though the pavement contaminating the pavement material, and as such the entire damage section will require pavement replacement with new material.    23   Figure 1.4 - Example of Typical Unsealed pavement only road for the Wandoan Region (Old Chinchilla Rd, Guluguba) Formation only roads are typically minor roads which provide access only to local landowners, of which there are few. For example, Burradoo Road to the west of the WWRN recorded a total AADT of 6 vehicles per day at last count in 2005 (Western Downs Regional Council, 2009). These formation only roads often don’t service enough of the community to warrant the expenditure of a gravel pavement, and as such provide only an absolute minimum level of service. These roads often require minimal maintenance due to the low traffic volumes experienced, but are often untrafficable under wet conditions.   24   Figure 1.5 – Example of typical formation only road, Wandoan (Perretts Rd, Bundi) Figure 1.5 shows a typical formation only road operating well under dry conditions. Evidence of wheel rutting indicates the low tolerance of these formation only roads to traffic during wet weather events. 1.3.2.2 Existing Drainage Structures Of the existing drainage structures in the Wandoan Road Network, Bridges constitute approximately half of all major flow crossings. Of the existing bridges in the Wandoan Region, the majority are timber pile and girder bridges. These bridges prove common due to the relative low cost to construct at the time of construction. Constructed in the 1960’s or 1970’s, labour and hardwood timber were both inexpensive and plentiful resources in the region, and because of this and the relative unavailability of concrete, the majority of the drainage structures in the area were constructed in this manner. These bridges were often constructed to a for a T44 maximum design vehicle, indicating a maximum load of 44 tonnes. As such these bridges are unideal for use by the modern road trains. There are a number of timber bridges in the WWRN, located on Bundi, Yeovil, Booral, and Grosmont Roads.   25   Figure 1.6 - Timber Bridge – Bundi Road, Wandoan The alternative to timber bridges at major creek crossings in the Wandoan Area are large Reinforce Concrete Box Culverts (RCBC). The majority of these units were constructed of cast insitu reinforced concrete and prove more durable and suitable to modern vehicles than the timber bridges of the region. However, due to their nature, these culverts are constructed at low level crossings only, meaning that these structures are often inundated and submerged during large flows. During minor to moderate flows however these structures provide a safe and trafficable means of crossing for traffic.   Figure 1.7 - Large Cast Insitu Cuvlert  26  At minor crossings or areas where water will frequently cross a road, the most common treatments are small culverts, similar to the above but of hydraulic area ≤3m², or concrete floodways. Concrete floodways are often used in areas where fast moving flows will cross a road, or where slow flows will inundate the road for extended periods of time. These floodways essentially do not provide any flood immunity to a road during the time of the event, but provide a much more durable asset which is less prone to the failures that would be experienced if a sealed or unsealed granular pavement road was constructed in the same area.   Figure 1.8 - Concrete Floodway – Bundi Road, Wandoan 1.3.2.3 Existing Traffic Volume As shown by Appendix 2 – Historic Traffic Volumes Wandoan Rural, the historic traffic volumes for Bundi Road was 117 vehicles per day, with 36% Heavy Vehicles in January 2009. Considering the road Hierarchy in the network, as shown in Appendix 3 – Wandoan Rural Road Hierarchy, this count is modest. The road status as a Rural Collector refers to its role in the network of collecting all traffic in the Eastern Wandoan Area and transporting this to the Rural Arterial roads of Jackson-Wandoan road and the Leichardt Highway, which run between major population centres.  1.3.3 Forecast Network Conditions The major impact to WWRN road conditions due to CSG developments in the region is a significant increase in traffic volume on these local roads. Data provided to the Snowy  27  Mountains Engineering Corporation (SMEC) by QGC indicate and expected construction traffic of 433 vehicles per day on average, for a period of 1.5 years (SMEC, 2014). This means an increase in AADT of 370% during this construction period, and an increase of 45.2% due to operational traffic over the following 8 years. This traffic data is shown below in figure 2.1.  Figure 1.9 - Design Traffic Summary While this increase in traffic does not directly affect the resiliency of the Wandoan West Road Network, it does dramatically increase the commercial and community dependency on the network, as well as substantially increasing the repercussions of a network failure. This concept is expressed in figure 1.2, using the principles proposed by (Omer, et al., 2013) as detailed in section 11 of this chapter in terms of travel time for road users.   28   Figure 1.10 Increased consequences of network failure due to increased traffic volume As shown above, an increase in traffic volume is directly proportional to increases in the measures of reduced network performance. To analyse this further, assuming an hourly rate per road user of $35/hr, this decrease in network performance could be expressed as an additional cost to the local community of $14,745.50. In order to reduce the impact of this disruption, additional measures would be required which either reduce the severity of the disruption (R value), or reduce the duration of the disruption (D value).  Though a gross oversimplification of the NIRA Framework developed by (Omer, et al., 2013), figure 1.2 illustrates well the concept of increased potential for loss, or increased consequence of road network failure due to increased traffic volume.  This increased potential for loss is a currently developing issue in the Wandoan West Road Network. This paper aims to investigate this increased potential for loss due to network  29  resilience, and the financial implications this would have for all road users, particularly road traffic involved in the development of CSG facilities in the area.  To offset the dramatic increases in traffic volume, QGC and Origin Energy are in the process of constructing a number of upgrades to the WWRN. These proposed and in process upgrades will be detailed and analysed in the Analysis chapter of this report.      30  0501001502002503003504004501/11/2010 1/12/2010 1/01/2011 1/02/2011 1/03/2011 1/04/2011 1/05/2011 1/06/2011 1/07/2011 1/08/2011 1/09/2011 1/10/2011 1/11/2011 1/12/2011 1/01/2012 1/02/2012 1/03/2012 1/04/2012 1/05/2012 1/06/2012 1/07/2012 1/08/2012 1/09/2012 1/10/2012 1/11/2012 1/12/2012 1/01/2013 1/02/2013 1/03/2013 1/04/2013 1/05/2013 1/06/2013 1/07/2013 1/08/2013 1/09/2013 1/10/2013 1/11/2013 1/12/2013 CUMULATIVE MONTHLY RAINFALL (MM) DATE CUMULATIVE MONTHLY RAINFALL  (STN 35014 -  WANDOAN POST OFFICE)  1.4 IMPACTS OF SIGNIFICANT FLOOD EVENTS 1.4.1 Past Flood Events WDRC experienced significant network damage and disruption in the years 2010-11, and 2013 due to Tropical Cyclones Tasha and Anthony from November 20 to February 2011, and Tropical Cyclone Ostwald in 2013. These events can be identified in the chart below created from BOM historic rainfall data for station 35014 located at the Wandoan Post Office (Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, 2015).   Figure 1.11 - Cumulative monthly Rainfall Data (Wandoan Post Office) 2010-2014 (Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, 2015) Note that due to a lack of records regarding road closure durations and extents during both of these events, durations for road closures have been determined by interview with WDRC Staff present in the area during the time of the events, and involved in the subsequent emergent and restoration works.   31   1.4.1.1 2011 Event – Tropical Cyclones Tasha and Anthony November 2010 – February 2011 Due to widespread torrential rain caused by Category 1 Cyclone Tasha in December 2010, and Category 2 Cyclone Anthony in January 2011, large swathes of the Western Downs Regional Council road network were inundated as tributaries of the Fitzroy River Basin reached and exceeded their natural capacity. This flooding of the Fitzroy Basin was determined to be a 1% AEP Event, meaning that the probability of a rainfall event of this magnitude is approximately an average of once every 100 years.  This widespread flooding caused massive disruption to the Wandoan Road Network, with all bridges in the region being submerged for a period of 2 days, with some low lying bridges remaining submerged for up to 2 weeks. Following floodwaters receding these roads became trafficable, though many were significantly damaged due to flow across the road way, or damage to drainage structures. Further to this, many of the roads that weren’t damaged outright by inundation were weakened due to moisture penetration and saturation of the granular pavement. This weakening of the road resulted in damage once exposed to traffic loads, resulting in potholes, pavement deformation, and damage to the bitumen seal, and rutting.  The rectification of this work was undertaken in two distinct stages. The emergency restoration work, referred to as emergent work, and the restoration of non-hazardous defects. The emergent work period takes place immediately following the flood event, with works identified as dangerous and in need of emergency repair by WDRC staff, and being immediately repaired dependant on resources. The restoration work period can occur much later, due the time taken for the asset owner (WDRC) to gather data and submit claims to the QRA, and the time taken for the QRA to assess the claim to determine eligibility. Many local councils will not proceed with restoration work until given approval for the eligibility of the work by QRA. This is to minimise the risk to council of additional expenditure, should the work be completed and then determined to be non-eligible.  The figure 1.12 demonstrates the extent of the flooding due to the 1% AEP event associated with Cyclones Tasha and Anthony.   32   Figure 1.12 - 1% AEP Event footprint - Fitzroy Basin (Department of Natural Resources and Mines, 2015) The estimated cost to repair this damage in the WWRN alone was $1,817,000. $9,492,000 for the entire Wandoan Region, and $67,183,000 for the entire Western Downs Regional Council Area (Western Downs Regional Council, 2011).  In addition to the enormous financial cost of reconstructing the damaged network, there were unestimated losses to the community due to the network operating at sub-optimal performance for the duration of restoration works. As discussed earlier, the emergent works phase restored the network to a minimum acceptable level of safety in a matter of weeks, however the restoration phase of this reconstruction was in operation until June of 2013, meaning the network was operating below the regular performance level for a period of 2.5 years.  1.4.1.2 2013 Event – Tropical Cyclone Ostwald 2013 In similar circumstance to the widespread flooding of 2011 caused by tropical cyclones Tasha and Anthony, major flooding to the Wandoan Road Network was caused in January  33  2013 by torrential rain accompanying the landfall of Category 1 Tropical Cyclone Ostwald. This event was less severe than the preceding 2011 event as shown in figure 1.11, however this event still caused significant and widespread damage and disruption to the Wandoan Road Network.  Figure 1.13 - Historic Daily Rainfall (2010-2014) Wandoan Post Office (Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology, 2015) Figure 1.13 better illustrates the intensity of the 2013 TC Ostwald Flood Event in the Wandoan Region. While the total cumulative value for the month is not as high as the 2011 event as indicated by figure 1.11, the peak daily rainfall is 87% of the 2011 peak daily rainfall, and this rainfall was consistent over two consecutive days during the 2013 Event. The result is a flood event of similar severity, but of shorter duration and equally as capable of causing widespread damage to the local infrastructure networks. The total cost for reconstruction and recovery of the network in the Wandoan Area was estimated at $3,352,000 for reconstruction works, and $513,000 for emergent works. This amounted to a total estimated recovery cost of $3,865,000.   01020304050607080901001/01/20101/03/20101/05/20101/07/20101/09/20101/11/20101/01/20111/03/20111/05/20111/07/20111/09/20111/11/20111/01/20121/03/20121/05/20121/07/20121/09/20121/11/20121/01/20131/03/20131/05/20131/07/20131/09/20131/11/20131/01/20141/03/20141/05/2014RECORED RAINFALL (MM) DATE R ECORDED DAILY  R AINFALL   (STN  35014 -  WAN DOAN POST  OFF ICE)   34  The restoration works for this event were delivered in a similar manner to the 2011 flood damage event, in two distinct phases: the emergent works phase, and the restoration phase. The result of this is the most dangerous or disruptive defects to the network were restored to a minimum level of service in a short timeframe following the event, but the bulk of the defects (86.7% as a proportion of value of work) were delivered gradually over a 2.5 year period.  1.4.2 Consequences and reduced level of service 1.4.2.1 Short Term Network Disruption Short Term Network Disruption in regards to the 2010-11 and 2013 Flood Events detailed, refers to disruptions to the network during the flood event itself. These short term disruptions were manifested primarily in the inundation and untraffickibility of key bridges for extended periods of time due to abnormally high flood water levels.  A number of bridges were inundated during the 2011 Flood Event for a period of 48 hours (Chown & Harth, 2015) including structures on all major creeks in the area, including: Horse Creek, Juandah Creek, Wooleebee Creek, Roche Creek, Eurombah Creek, and Bungaban Creek. The location of these structure is shown below in figure 1.14. The importance of these structures to maintaining network function is clearly shown, with the entire WWRN and surrounding area isolated should these bridges not be functional. These images are generated using Google Earth and the Queensland Globe (Queensland Government, 2015).   35  Figure 1.14 - Bridge Locations - WWRN (Google Earth, 2015) These disruptions will be restored to service naturally with the receding of floodwaters to allow trafficability of these structures. Further to this most structures will be inspected to ensure no compromising damage to the structure has occurred prior to allowing traffic to use the structure.  1.4.2.2 Long Term Network Disruption Long Term Network Disruptions refers to the damage to the network which reduces the level of network performance until the defect is repaired. These disruptions become apparent following the flood event and the natural restoration of the short term disruptions (bridges). These disruptions are the result of various types of damage to road pavement, surfacing, or drainage structures.   36  Damages to sealed pavements constituted approximately $2,976,000 worth of the restoration cost of the 2011 Floods to the Wandoan Region. This is 31% of the total reconstruction value. The most common of these defects can be broadly defined as damage to sealed pavement, damage to bitumen seal, and damage to unsealed shoulder. This is a very vague and broad generalisation of defects to a sealed road, but will prove sufficient for description of flood damage to sealed roads in the WWRN. Examples of these defects are shown below in figure 1.15. These defects are most commonly repaired by reconstruction of the damaged pavement and application of a new bitumen seal to the reconstructed pavement.  Figure 1.15 - Examples of Pavement deformation due to moisture ingress including damage to bitumen seal (right) and damage to the unsealed shoulder (Left) Damages to Unsealed Pavement constituted 38% of the overall cost of reconstruction of the 2011 Flood Event in the Wandoan region, with an estimated repair cost of $3,645,000. Damage to unsealed roads was most commonly experienced as deformation of saturated pavement material, and loss or scouring of pavement material due to overland flow or inundation. The repair treatment in both cases usually constitutes resheeting of the gravel pavement with new pavement material, or compaction and profiling of the existing material to restore to geometry and crossfall. These defects are illustrated in figure 1.16.   37    Figure 1.16 - Deformation of Saturated Pavement (left) and scouring and loss of pavement materials due to overland flow (right) Damage to formation only roads is also common not only after major flood events, but any form of significant rainfall. Being a lower class of asset, these roads are more easily damaged by wet weather, but are also more easily restored, usually requiring only regrading of the road to restore to the previous level of service. A significant amount of formation grading was required to restore formation only roads to service following both flood events. In particular, the lower order roads to the west of the Wandoan District.  Figure 1.17 - Damage to Formation Only road - Perretts Road Wandoan As expected in flood events of significantly high magnitude, drainage structures are required to accommodate weather flows far greater than their design capacity, and as a result of this often sustain damage. This damage can take the form of undermining or  38  scouring on the downstream side of the structure due to high velocity flow, separation of reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) components, build-up of silt or debris, or inundation or damage to the surrounding road.  Figure 1.18 - Scouring on downstream side of concrete floodway due to high velocity flow, severe damage to RCP units due to hydraulic pressure build-up caused by insufficient capacity Each of these defects will affect the performance of a road network differently according to location, severity, and road hierarchy and usage. All defects as documented in the recovery of the 2011 Flood Event in the WWRN will be considered individually in order to determine the impact that defect would have on the capacity of the particular road segment or network link. From this the reduction in network capacity and performance may be determined, and the network resilience to a flood event of Q100 magnitude, as experienced as a result of TC Tasha and Anthony, calculated and quantified.     39  1.5 EXISTING FRAMEWORKS AND PROCEDURES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK RESILIENCE There are currently a number of frameworks which aim to assess the level of resilience of a transport network. These include the Networked Infrastructure Resiliency Assessment (NIRA) frame work (Omer, et al., 2013), the framework proposed by (Bruneau, et al., 2003) for the quantitative assessment of the seismic resilience of communities, a risk based approach to resilience calculation as provided by (Zoubir, 2013), and the Three-Stage Resilience Analysis Framework developed by (Ouyang, et al., 2012). In addition to the level of service provided by transport networks, it is also important to consider the many underlying economic factors which may indicate the priority of a particular road asset. These may include industries supplied or dependant on the network, access of landowners to health and other services, and in the case of local government, the asset owner’s responsibility to landowners and the public. An example of the importance of this; the estimated economic losses caused due to the 2011 flood event are estimated to be between $5bn and $6bn (Uren, 2011). There are a number of frameworks which have been developed and proposed as means of quantifying and assessing the level of resilience of an infrastructure network. Though not all of these frameworks apply directly to transport infrastructure networks, the general principles of most can be applied to such. A number of these frameworks will be investigated below with the aim of determining the framework most suited to the network being analysed, and the framework which will produce the most relevant and meaningful results.  1.5.1 A framework to Quantitatively Assess and Enhance the Seismic Resilience of Communities  A Framework to Quantitatively Assess and Enhance the Seismic Resilience of Communities was authored by (Bruneau, et al., 2003) and published in Volume 19, No. 4 of the Journal; Earthquake Spectra.  This paper presents a conceptual framework to be used in analysing the current resilience of communities to seismic disruptions, and developing quantitative measures of resilience that may then be used to identify possible methods or practises for enhancing this resilience. At the time of publishing there had been many previous investigations into  40  seismic resilience. However, the majority of this research has been focused on developing new technologies or knowledge to increase seismic resilience, being a qualitative assessment of the concept. Due to this there was little understanding of the factors contributing to resilience, or the systematic process required to assess a community’s current level of resilience. This quantitative approach is necessary to better implement and identify the need for those technologies and knowledge discussed earlier.  1.5.1.1 General Measures of Resilience (Bruneau, et al., 2003) defines community seismic resilience as “the ability of social units (e.g. organisations, communities) to mitigate hazards, contain the effects of disasters when they occur, and carry out recovery activities in ways that minimise social disruption and mitigate the effects of future earthquakes. This definition provides clear objectives for the framework, being that any actions to enhance the resilience of the community should increase the probability of core services functioning during a disruption. Core services would include infrastructure, such as water supply or electricity, or community services such as health care. If these services are able to function during disruptions, the severity and duration of the consequences of this disruption is likely to be significantly reduced.  1.5.1.2 Concept and Quantification of Resilience (Bruneau, et al., 2003) states that a resilient system is one which reduces the chances of a disruption or shock, has increased capacity to absorb the shock without diminishing performance to an unacceptable level, and has the ability to recover quickly after a shock. To summarise, a resilient system shows: 1. Reduced failure probabilities 2. Reduced consequences from failures 3. Reduced Time to Recovery These concepts are illustrated in the below figure from (Bruneau, et al., 2003);  41  Figure 1.19 - Measure of Seismic Resilience - conceptual definition (Bruneau, et al., 2003) This illustration defines the quality of infrastructure Q(t) as a percentage of performance capacity at any point in time (t), where 0% would indicate a complete lack of service and 100% would indicate no degradation in service from design levels.  As shown in Figure 1, disruptions or shocks cause a loss of service which is then repaired to design capacity over time. This diminished performance over time then represents the loss of resilience for that specific event. This can be expressed by the in
