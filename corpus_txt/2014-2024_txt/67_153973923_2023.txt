Cities, public authorities, and private organizations respond to climatechangewith various green policies and strategies to enhance community resilience.However, these community-level transition processes are complex and requiredeliberate and collective planning. Under this context, the purpose of this studyis to understand the energy actions taken at the local level, as well as to analyzethe differences between the neighborhoods’ green energy transitions in terms oftheir socio-economic aspects, using a big data perspective. The paper is addressingthe following question: what was the role that the pandemic played in accelerat-ing or slowing Boston’s green investments, and to what extent do different racialand socioeconomic groups invest in green technologies during this period? Thestudy aims to answer these research questions using the City of Boston as a casestudy to reveal different neighborhoods’ paths in achieving the transformation ofcity ecosystems towards green neutrality. Next, the theoretical framework buildsthe linkages among the city’s measures, climate actions proposed by the Cityof Boston, and their associated contexts and outcomes in shaping new policyand planning models for higher ‘green’ performance. Following the understand-ing of the actions, the neighborhoods’ socio-economic and building permit datawere assessed to understand whether economic disparities exacerbated duringthe pandemic have affected neighborhoods’ performance in green transition. Thismethod is applied in a comparative study of its 23 neighborhoods, using a datasetprovided by Boston Area Research Initiative (BARI). Intriguingly, the paper’sfindings show that racial differences within the city have no significant impact ontech-related expenditures. There is a clear negative correlation between povertyrate and investment, which indicates the reverse relationship between these socio-economic factors. The study concludes that city authorities will need to addressthe challenges of each community achieving green transition with more targetedprograms based on its needs.© The Author(s) 2023C.

Sohrabi et al.Keywords: Technological resilience · Big data analytics · Covid-19 Pandemic ·Green transition · Urban innovation · Climate change · Socioeconomic analysis ·LEED1 Introduction and Context1.1 General ObservationsThe sustainable city discourse is becoming ubiquitous and highlights the need for a long-term strategic approach to create a regional context in which sustainable developmentis increasingly becoming the norm [1]. Wheeler identified sustainability “as requiring aholistic, long-term planning approach, as well as certain general policy directions suchas compact urban form, reductions in automobile use, protection of ecosystems, andimproved equity” [2]. By the end of the 20th century, “sustainable city” initiatives beganto emerge in different parts of the world [2]. Then, the arrival of “resilience” as a newconcept of urban policy and a buzzword has reformulated the imperatives of sustain-ability in the context of the environmental crisis [3, 4]. The current resilient sustainablediscourse reflects that the city can and should be green but it needs significant innovations[5]. The discourse of sustainable and resilient cities showed that cities are the currentmajor challenge facing sustainable development - this ismainly due to an ever-increasingpopulation density and high energy consumption. But, at the moment, there is a shiftfrom understanding cities as environmental problems towards cities being understoodas the solution to environmental problems on a global scale [6]. Urban sustainability hasguided the development in urban and metropolitan areas around the globe in loweringtheir carbon footprints and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by targeting resource andenergy consumption in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the urban builtenvironment [7]. However, the complex environment that characterizes cities, and espe-cially metropolitans, makes the transition towards sustainability more challenging. Themounting climate pressures have compelled cities and planners to seek more green andinnovative alternatives to steer cities and their inhabitants towards sustainable pathways[8].The rapid growth of energy use has caused concerns regarding the supply, the collapseof energy resources, and the severe environmental impacts [9]. The global contributionsfrom buildings towards energy consumption have steadily increased [10]. Around theworld, buildings consume 38% of the world’s resources, generate 40% of the wastein landfill sites, and emit 28% of the greenhouse gases produced on the planet [11].Moreover, according to the US Green Building Council, buildings in the United Statesaccount for 36% of total energy, use 65% of electricity consumption, and almost 40%of global energy-related CO2 [https://www.usgbc.org/press/benefits-of-green-building].For this, reducing energy use includes the goal of reducing the electricity needed whileobtaining the same or nearly the same results from the building’s systems. Improvingthe energy consumption in buildings is a prime objective to reduce human impacts onthe environment at the national and international levels.Despite all the big pronouncements and pledges of the city authorities to becomegreener, the pandemic has shown us a bitter reality; the world is still very dependent onNavigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 287fossil fuels [12]. Cities are far behind reaching their targets of achieving 100% use ofclean energy. In this difficult equation, addressing the existing vulnerabilities, economicdisparities, and race inequalities will be key for the cities to become leaders in creatinga sustainable future for their residents. The current study works towards this direction,aiming to reveal a variety of inequities in how residents of different neighborhoods andracial and socioeconomic groups have been able to achieve a green transition beforeand during the pandemic. It uses the City of Boston dataset on building permits to testthe hypothesis within the city’s neighborhoods that vulnerable communities’ socioe-conomic context affects neighborhoods’ capabilities to achieve green transition. In thisline of reasoning, the research tries to conceptualize pillars of measures based on socioe-conomic factors and neighborhood physical formation to understand which factors aremost relevant to the pandemic shock absorption thus the resilience of the system.In order to fully weigh the benefits of innovative neighborhoods as a way to achieve agreen transition, we begin by identifying the city planning initiatives and discussing thecity’s climate actions. There are already citywide initiatives to finance energy efficiencyin municipal buildings, for example, the Renew Boston Trust. Nevertheless, we seek toevaluate private buildings’ implications for deep energy building retrofits, the installationof rooftop solar energy, and the procurement of zero-carbon electricity. The paper usesLEED’s green building system assessment standards as a proxy for investigating tech-related permits. The following section provides a brief overview of Boston’s climateaction plans and policies. In the remaining part of the paper, 23 neighborhoods withintheCity of Bostonwill be evaluated on the basis of their characteristics and their adoptionof green technology. We conclude by discussing the results of the study, to provide asense of the extent to which Boston is considering the advancement of reducing theamount of CO2 emissions that is emitted from buildings.1.2 Research Questions, Goals, and HypothesisDuring the last months, we have seen energy prices being dramatically surging as coun-tries and households confront shortages of oil, gas, and coal. In this period, the neigh-borhoods of Boston need to look at some of the major factors behind the energy crunch,from the role of green policies to the historical housing discrimination affecting home-ownership in the city. In this context, the discussion concerning urban informatics aroundthe potential pitfalls of the field that could harbor its overall success in improving citiesfor the user. One of the biggest concerns is the lack of interconnectivity between studiesin different cities of similar types. This seems like a big, missed opportunity as it couldexpose important relationships in the way cities function. Another, perhaps even largerchallenge, is maintaining an even level of funding amongst cities for urban informatics,an issue which is not easily solved. Larger cities will have bigger budgets for this mannerof project by default, meaning that cities without funding get left behind when it comesto the data analysis of the city. Although data mining and analysis in the urban environ-ment has grown exponentially in recent decades, the organization and execution of howwe interact with this data and use it for the public good are still in need of advancement.This paper aims to lead the policymakers to pay more profound attention to theneighborhood level to enhance the community level and form a much more robust net-work to face shocks and stresses. Resilience strategies stem from the technological288 P. Sohrabi et al.advancement of communities. Green technologies are knowledge-based assets; thus,local investments could lead the neighborhood to significant developments. Moreover,the current energy crisis has revealed the importance of creating self-sufficient commu-nities that can long-term produce the energy they use. This type of open systems, whichwill allow the regeneration of the energy in buildings, will affect the sustainability ofBoston’s neighborhoods.Through our research, we address the following questions: RQ1: what was the rolethat the pandemic played in accelerating or slowing Boston’s green investments? RQ2:Towhat extent do different racial and socioeconomic groups invest in green technologiesduring this period? These questions address the ways the pandemic affected the neigh-borhoods’ investments in green technologies as well as the ways that different racialand socioeconomic groups have been investing in green technologies before and duringthis recent healthcare crisis. We aim to approach our research as a critical point wherewe are collecting, analyzing, and visualizing big data which will allow us to understandneighborhoods’ dynamics and constraints in green transition.As urban problems continue to emerge, more data analysis is needed to supportcontinued efforts. Cities are living laboratories and have certainly shifted because of theCOVID-19 pandemic, so research should attempt to keep up with the latest changes.The recent unrest in cities and local governments necessitates research and expertise,especially since cities were almost breeding grounds for the pandemic. In order to under-stand cities, and reverse current inequalities, researchers must alter perspectives at thecity level, such as health crises, and provide equal opportunities to all populations, whichwill certainly require more robust technologies, data, and instruments. We hypothesizethat vulnerable communities’ socioeconomic context affects neighborhoods’ capabilitiesto achieve green transition.In the end, if the green transition is reliant on public policy or government interven-tion, there will need to be a transfer of knowledge and associated advocacy to promotechange at the neighborhood level. However, awareness of a problem does not necessarilybring a response that will follow suit, and though data can identify relationships, pat-terns, or problems, it does not always have the power to create change. Translating thefindings of the current and similar studies into tangible policy will be the most ambitiousgoal and challenging aspect of our future work in big data analytics.The paper sets out the study as follows:Section 1 presents the topic of green transition and green neutrality as a way toenhance community resilience during the pandemic. It also introduces the two mainresearch questions. The answer to these questions will provide support to city authoritiesto improve the current programs and policies they propose to enhance green neutrality atthe local, neighborhood scale. Section 2 provides an overview of other studies, previousresearch attempts and measurement tools in the discourse of big data analytics and urbaninformatics to identify city areas with better performance in carbon neutrality. Section 3introduces the socio-economic context of theCity ofBoston,which is used as a case studyand provides significant considerations regarding previous strategies and climate actionsin support of its green neutrality. It also analyzes significant constraints for Boston’sneighborhoods to achieve high performance towards that goal and attempts at exploringcorrelations between ‘green’ neighborhood performance and socio-economic context.Navigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 289Section 4 contains a big data-driven analysis of city investments in building permitsrelated to green transition, which was used as the main method to provide insights intohowdifferent neighborhoods are incorporating green technologies. Section 5 contains thefindings with a summary of the range of factors that affect neighborhoods’ performance,while Sect. 6 provides conclusions and recommendations for further study.2 Literature Review2.1 Building a Framework for Measuring Green Transition Based on Other CaseStudies and ToolkitsBuildings contribute to 38% of carbon emissions which highlights the need for greenbuildings [11]. Therefore, over the past two decades, the green building movementstarted to emerge and new councils for green building were established. The US GreenBuilding Council defined a green building as they “are designed, constructed, and oper-ated to boost environmental, economic, health, and productivity performance over thatof conventional building.” [13]. As a result, green buildings have become a promisingpathway for the nation’s sustainable development. New assessment systems developedaround the world. For example, the US Green Building Council (USGBC) developed itsgreen building rating system, which is Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design(LEED). Similarly, the Building Research Establishment Environmental AssessmentMethod (BREEAM) in the UK, and the Green Star in Australia. Among those, the USwas one of themost developed areas in green building projects [14]. For instance, Austin,Texas, is best known for its efforts in green building [15]. It won an award at the first UNconference on sustainable development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Subsequently, localresidential green building movements rapidly emerged in many American cities suchas Denver, Colorado; Kitsap County, Washington; Clark County, Washington; the Bal-timore Suburban Builders Association; and the EarthCraft Houses Program in Atlanta.Besides USGBC, the US has a wide range of green building local organizations that tookpart in the green building movement. For example, the National Association of Home-builders issued guidance on how to create a green building program in the local area[16]. Additionally, local and state governments have been highly involved and promotinggreen building. In 1998, Boulder, Colorado stood up and passed an ordinance requiringspecific measures with respect to green building. Moreover, Pennsylvania, for example,made significant efforts to promote green building. It established the Governor’s GreenGovernment Council (GGGC) in part to address the implementation of green buildingprinciples in the state. The country even made it feasible for everyone and all organiza-tions to be up to date regarding everything related to green buildings in the US throughthe Environmental Building News - a monthly newsletter published by BuildingGreen.However, investments in green buildings have been very limited. For example, onlyUS$148 billion of the total US$5.6 trillion investment in buildings are allocated togreen buildings [11]. Moreover, Debrah et al. revealed the gap in green finance in greenbuildings in the research area [17]. They pointed out that although the US is dominantin the green investments debate [18], it has very limited academic research on this topic.Their review of the research area worldwide on green investments in buildings showsthat “GF-in-GBs [Green Finance in Green Buildings] research has been around for about290 P. Sohrabi et al.only a decade now, although both the green finance and green building research fieldsin general were born in the 1970s”. This underpins the crucial need for more studies ongreen building investments.For this, this study examines the econometrics capturing patterns of a US city’sperformance in supporting green building projects. We assess Boston’s neighborhoodgrowth and ‘green’ investment through the volume and profile of building permits.We focus on the spreading supply of GHG-free electricity in the City of Boston. Weevaluate the number of investments that go to green transition, assess the number ofbuildings’ tech-related projects such as rooftop solar energy in different neighborhoodsand assess the potential of the city’s neighborhoods in adopting low- and zero-GHG fuelsto reduce emissions and adapt other green technologies. Our central argument is thatinnovation is one of the main drivers to post-carbon transition at the neighborhood level.Innovation is at the heart of the transition to a cleaner global environment. However,“it is still insufficient to address the environmental challenges facing the planet today”[19]. There are some barriers that could limit the green transition such as a lack of publicacceptance of new technologies, financial barriers, and innovation capacities [19], andthere is evidence to suggest that the pace of green innovation has slowed in recent years.This suggests that major barriers remain and need to be lifted to accelerate the transition.2.2 Technological Resilience as a Factor of Neighborhoods Green TransitionBefore and During the PandemicTechnological resilience is a factor of regional resilience that relies on the capacity of acity or region to capture technological changes over time. Balland et al., proposed fourpillars to identify this concept in a regional realm [20]. Although our research deals withsimilar attributes,we aim to extend this understanding to a local level,where communitieshave their own evolutionary paths to fulfill transition goals requirements, and localunits have their own structural identities based on path dependency. In other words,we are translating the effort of technological resilience conceptualization in regionaleconomic geography into a tangible measurable analysis to generate local maps andmodels. According to the mentioned reference, looking at two semitrances aspects: first,evolutionary development path: could be addressed in a way to reveal the crisis effect onthe evolution of a city utilizing the neighborhoods as cells of the system. The shock due tothe pandemic, stated earlier, changed the course of the investment pattern, and emerged anewornament that creates a local definition of evolutionary development. In this research,we rely on these attributes benefiting from a before/during shock classification.Second, Path dependency: as explained by scholars there is a strong relationship in thelegacy of the history of local units and the current status of the resources. In this research,we brought the structural properties of the neighborhood into the investigation in a wayto address the racial configuration and physical characteristics of the neighborhood.Nevertheless, there is a tendency in the literature claiming path dependency is an issuefor looking at the emerging characteristics of the local units.In this research, we are looking at the mentioned identities under the lens of big datato examine historically claimed status about racial disparities and physical configuration.Navigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 2913 The Case Study of Boston3.1 Assessing Boston as a Case Study Towards a Net Zero Carbon, Equitableand Resilient Built EnvironmentBoston is an East Coast city with 23 neighborhoods (Fig. 1). Boston is experiencingincreasing sea levels and a range of climatic issues, including flooding, storm surge, andextreme temperatures. Historically, Boston expanded by landfill projects which creatednew neighborhoods and almost doubled the city’s area. Thus, the City of Boston nowdeals with a vulnerable position on reclaimed land. If sea levels continue to rise inthe Boston area, the Climate Ready Boston initiative predicts that by 2070, upward of90,000 residents in the city will be at severe risk, with billions of dollars of infrastructure,property, and business loss [21, 22]. Future sea level rise and temperature change dependon how much the world is able to cut carbon emissions. Nevertheless, water is not theonly risk, extreme temperatures and heat waves put Boston under threats for publichealth, especially for vulnerable communities. Sasaki analyzed that by 2070s, the annuallosses from flooding could cost up to $1.4 billion, and the exposure to flooding couldFig. 1. Boston’s Neighborhoods292 P. Sohrabi et al.include 14% of Boston’s population (88,000 people), 10% of the city’s K-12 schools, 32MBTA stations, 240 essential public facilities (law enforcement stations, fire stations,and EMS), and sections of many evacuation routes [23]. On the other hand, extreme heatwill increase mortality rates [23].3.2 Previous Strategies and Climate Plans in Boston to Understand GreenTransitionBoston’s journey toward resilience planning and climate action has been comprehensivesince the start of the twenty-first century [24]. In 2000, Boston joined the Cities for Cli-mate Protection Campaign of ICLEI—Local Governments for Sustainability. Throughthis campaign, Boston pledged to step up for increasing energy efficiency and reducinggreenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, Mayor Menino decided to develop and implementa local action plan to fight against greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions. Five yearslater, Boston adopted the U.S. Mayor Climate Protection Agreement and joined the tar-get of reducing carbon emissions to below 1990 levels [25]. In 2007, the city of Bostonreleased its first citywide climate action plan. Boston’s former mayor, Thomas Menino,issued an executive order in 2007 on climate change that set an ambitious goal for thecity to reduce its GHG emissions by 80% by 2050. In 2008, Massachusetts enacted a lawthat required “the Department of Environmental Protection to establish targets for GHGemissions reductions below 1990 levels between 10–25% by 2020 and 80% by 2050”[26]. Since then, the city has adopted long-term climate goals such as waste reduction,transportation and mobility, mitigation, and adaptation. The City of Boston started tointegrate the community in the action plans and thus in March 2009, Mayor ThomasM. Menino formed the Boston Climate Action Leadership Committee and CommunityAdvisory Committee. The aim of the committee is to propose recommendations to theMayor and set the goals and objectives that Boston should follow in order to confront therisks of climate change. Hence, over a year, community leaders came together to developrecommendations on buildings, transportation, and adaptation. In 2010, the committeeproposed Sparking Boston’s Climate Revolution report [27]. This report was fruitful andrich of recommendations to tackle climate change.Along with Mayor Menino aiming to bring all levels of community together, theGreen Ribbon Commission was launched [28]. The commission was a way to engagethe city’s business and civic leaders for the same goal. It aims at designing and imple-menting the City’s climate adaptation andmitigation strategy. In 2011, Boston set carbonreduction goals of 25%by2020 and80%by2050below2005 levels. Later,MayorMartinJ. Walsh announced that Boston joins the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40).In 2015, the City of Boston joined the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance (CNCA) withcities from all over the world. Each city has committed to save the planet and mitigateglobal warming. A year later, the Mayor launched Climate Ready Boston [29]. It is “aninitiative to plan for how the city will continue to thrive while adapting to long-termclimate change. It has three main components: climate project consensus (completed bythe Boston Research Advisory Group), vulnerability assessment, and resilience initia-tives”. In 2017,MayorWalsh announced Boston’s goal of carbon neutrality by 2050—anambitious yet necessary commitment to meet the urgency of the climate challenge [30].In Imagine Boston 2030, the city’s long-term strategic plan, also sets an interim carbonNavigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 293reduction goal of 50% by 2030. Carbon neutrality goal means that Boston is fulfilling thecommitment to the Paris Climate Agreement and leading efforts to keep global warmingunder 1.5 degrees Celsius. By 2017, the City of Boston reduced emissions from munic-ipal buildings and fleets by more than 40% below 2005 levels. Based on the progressBoston expects to make in energy efficiency and renewable energy, this Plan increasesthe reduction goal for municipal operations from 50% to 60% by 2030.Boston’smost recent climate action plan, released in 2019, sets the stage for Boston’stransition to carbon neutrality and describes the roadmap for the next five years [31].The 2019 Climate Action Plan (CAP) focuses on strategies to accelerate emissionsreductions from three work areas: buildings, transportation, and energy supply.We focusin our study on Boston’s buildings as buildings account for over 70% of greenhouse gasemissions in Boston [32]. Boston’s two main targets for building are adopting a zeronet carbon standard for new constructions by 2030 and retrofitting and electrifying atleast 80% of exciting buildings over the next 30 years. Adopting a zero net carbonstandard by 2030 would cut 17% of cumulative emissions from new construction to2050; adoption by 2023 would cut another 17% [31]. According to the city, reachingcarbon neutrality is possible if effective legislation is enacted and implemented in atimely manner. On the other hand, four out of five existing buildings in Boston will needdeep energy retrofitting and moving to fossil-fuel-free heating and hot water systems inorder to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Existing building energy retrofitting can leadto reducing the city emissions by up to 40%. The City of Boston requires residentialbuildings that are 20,000 ft2 or larger (excluding parking) or have 15 or more units toreduce their building emissions and to begin reporting their energy use in 2022. By doingthis, owners and tenants would become more aware of their energy use and costs, andgreenhouse gas emissions. They would be able to compare them to similar size buildingsand give opportunities to reduce the energy consumption. The City of Boston suggestedthat deep energy retrofits should happen by 1) Upgrading mechanical systems, lightingsystems, and appliances; 2) Insulating walls, roofs, crawlspaces, and foundations; 3)Upgrading HVAC and plumbing; 4) Replacing windows; 5) Air sealing; 6) Installingrenewable energy systems where possible.Moreover, the city suggested converting fossil fuel systems to electric equivalents.With deep energy retrofits and electrification, existing buildings can become carbonneutral. There are existing state incentives, such asMass Save, that help residents upgradetheir energy efficiency and it offers awide range of services, and incentives. In addition toMass Save, there are over 14 units that were implemented byE+GreenBuilding Programlaunched by the City of Boston in order to regenerate multi-unit residential buildings andbring energy and environmentally positive homes to Boston’s neighborhoods. To reachcarbon neutrality, the city will need to implement deep energy retrofits and electrificationby 2050. Businesses, residents, and the city should investmore in solar panels on buildingrooftops and other green technologies to have more energy-efficient buildings. In theend, communities will benefit environmentally, socially, and economically, since theseinvestments will also spur innovation and job creation.294 P. Sohrabi et al.In the next section, there is a data analysis of the city’s investments in technologicalprojects that will help the city and each neighborhood to make a successful transi-tion to being a green city. Throughout the section, we get a glimpse of how differentneighborhoods are adopting green technologies.Boston’s DemographicsBoston was ranked 19th in terms of segregation in 2019. By 2020, the city’s dissimilarityindex between black and white residents is 68.8, which implies that more than 68.8%of whites would have to move to a different neighborhood so that blacks and whites areequally distributed across all neighborhoods. As compared to 2010, this was an increasefrom the 60% index of dissimilarity [33].There are several articles discussing Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC)“redlining” maps (Fig. 2) and how in the long run it still affects the trajectories ofurban neighborhoods and more specifically the structure of segregation and economicinequality [34, 35]. Areas that were labeled hazardous or “redlined” by lending institu-tions, were denied access to capital investments, which could improve the housing andeconomic opportunity of residents. In spite of the fact that redlining occurred through-out the country, racial segregation in Boston was particularly egregious. In addition toFig. 2. Boston’s Redlining Map. Source [33].Navigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 295redlining, the federal government funded 25 public housing projects in the Boston area,all of which were racially segregated by race [33].It is likely that the long history of racial disparities in the US has affected the neigh-borhood’s ability tomake the transition towards a green economy,whichwe are exploringin this study.4 Scope, Methods and Data CollectionThe study uses big data analysis as a crucial method to detect patterns and correlationsrelated to neighborhood inequalities in green transition. Furthermore, it explores newopportunities that can be derived from such analyses. The research methodology isstructured to assess the prioritization of each neighborhood’s investment before andduring COVID-19 pandemic shock in the City of Boston and to find out themost relevantvariables for this prioritization. We tested our hypothesis on vulnerable and prosperedneighborhoods’ behavior against acute shocks. The methodology of this research relieson exploring a significant number of observations in the City of Boston to see if COVID-19 pandemic changed the investment priorities among the city’s 23 neighborhoods. Thiscould shed light on the inclusiveness issue in transition during shocks. Thus, to answerthe research questions stated earlier, we used the Boston Permits dataset published byBoston Area Research Initiative (BARI) to capture neighborhoods’ tendency to invest intechnological-related projects prior to and during the pandemic shock. When this studywas conducted, the data was only available up until March of 2021. Due to this and inorder to create two equal subsets of observations, we selected the period 23rd March2019–2020 as the pre-pandemic and the period 24th March 2020–2021 as the pandemicperiod.The following step was to transform the dataset from addresses and ZIP codes to the23 neighborhoods defined by theCity ofBoston for easier interpretation. The dataset con-tained 435k observations for all recorded permits which were filtered and then summedto the neighborhood level. As the permits were related to different aspects of buildings,we ran a text analysis algorithm using solar energy and LEEDs’ certificate-related key-words (Table 1) to find tech-related projects in order to be aligned with our questionsregarding green transition.Table 1. Keywords used for supporting the dataset based on LEED measurements.solar Voltage low emittingEnergy Recycle Thermal comfortTech waste management innovationpanel Environmental refrigerantrenewable green power cooling towerThis step revealed a total of 299 building permits aimed at decreasing energy con-sumption by using technology. Among the keywords listed in the energy section of the296 P. Sohrabi et al.LEED, we identified a corpus of 15 keywords that are repeated several times and identi-fied as important to the research question and topic of this paper (Table 1). We analyzedthe green transition across Boston’s neighborhoods before and after COVID-19 pan-demic based on these keywords. Then we used the IQR technique and removed outliersdue to the high data variance within a neighborhood.After sorting the observations, and creating two time periods, we conducted threeparts of analysis based on this data. The first part started by creating a frequency tableto compare the number of all permit requests for each period to the number of permitsfor tech-related projects. To compare these numbers, we compute the proportion of eachcategory (all permits issued and technology-related permits) for each period (Eqs. 1&2).Then, in order to determine the trend of permits issuance,we calculated the change rate ofeach category (Eq. 3). If the results show a positive sign that indicates that technologicalprojects were less impacted by the shock than the other categories, while the negativesign describes that in these areas technologically related projects were heavily affectedby the shock.A =∑XA∑(XA − a) (1)T =∑XT∑(XT − a) (2)M = A− T (3)whereA is the change rate in the number of all issued permitsT is the change rate in all tech-related permitsXA is the number of all issued permitsa is the change in pre- and during-pandemicXT is the number of all tech-related permitsM Proposed technological resilience measureAfter the first part of the analysis was completed, the next step was to quantify theinvestment per neighborhood in both periods and compare the two to find a specific flow.As a way of making a fair comparison between neighborhoods, we calculated a fixedamount of USD (100 dollars) per house.The third part was to measure and determine which possible variables influence theinvestment in these periods. We explored a mathematical model to work on the context-based indicators to find an appropriate regression line. After combining socioeconomicfactors of Boston neighborhoods retrieved from Census.gov &Analyze Boston platform(the City of Boston’s open data hub to find facts, figures, and maps related to lives withinthe city), we decided to elaborate on three pillars. Social factors include age, race, andeducational degree. The next pillar is dedicated to exploring the economics of people,such as median income, and poverty rate. The last pillar of the data set investigates thephysical properties such as the ratio of vacant houses, poverty rate per neighborhood, andrace proportion. After that, we ran a multivariate regression (MVR) in which we had adependent variable of 100 USD invested in tech-related per house in each neighborhoodand the variables mentioned earlier as independent variables. After running the model,residual analyses andANOVAexplain themodel fitness and quality of selected variables.Navigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 2975 Research Findings and DiscussionBased on the analysis of the patterns of permits issued by the city of Boston overthe past decade, it appears that the number of permits issued by the city in 2020 hasshown a dramatic decline (see Fig. 3). Subsequently, the technology-related domain hasalso been impacted, but the rate of this change has been quite slow. This 2019–2020period can be compared to the Covid-19 pandemic. A major objective of this study isto identify the trend distribution and the possible factors that impact this distribution atthe neighborhood level, and then to draw a different line between the general permit rateand the technology-related ones to determine if there are specific factors that influencethese two patterns differently.The first finding shows that the number of the total permissions for the period of oneyear before and the number for the one-year period during the pandemic differ by 46%.In this dataset, there are 50k records for 2019–2020 and 27k for 2020–2021. The sec-ond finding reinforces the first by estimating a similar proportion; in the first period, 8116tech-related projectswere recorded, while in the second period, 4679were found. Table 2illustrates a comparison of the change rate among Boston neighborhoods in the two peri-ods. On average, the number of projects set up dropped by almost half. Its standard devi-ation is 0.09, which indicates that all neighborhoods had a declining trend. However, wecould later determinewhatwas driving that in each neighborhood. The range is vast, from23% for the downtown neighborhood to 62% for Chinatown and the financial district.When we examine the frequency of the technological project, we observe a higher vari-ance that could translate to a gap between areas of Boston, and we introduce this as thefirst step in technological resilience explorative research. The average change in techno-logical projects is 41% less than the prior year,which is lower than the drop rate in the totalprojects. The standard deviation was 0.2 and the range is from 0.01 in Hyde Park to 0.94in South End, showing a 0 to almost 100% spectrum. We then proposed a technologicalresilience measure (See Table 2 & Fig. 4) by subtracting the change rate of technologicalprojects frequency from drop rates in all issued permits frequency.Fig. 3.

There was a more significant trend in technology-related projects than in therest of categories. The frequency of 12 neighborhood tech projects did not decrease assignificantly as the rest of neighborhoods. The resilience measure we proposed showednegative values in 8 neighborhoods (Fig. 5), but they are relativelyminor when comparedwith the negative rate in South End, which is−0.46. Beacon Hill, Jamaica Plain, and theNavigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 299Wharf District, however showed no signs of any deterioration or improvement duringthe pandemic.Having said that, South End, North End, Mission Hill, Fenway-Kenmore, BackBay, Roslindale, East Boston, and Brighton hold a negative value, sorted in ascendingorder. As mentioned before, since the decrease rate in tech-related projects is higherthan other categories, this indicates that technological domains were more valuableduring the shock. Alternatively, we have a list of neighborhoods, including Mattapan,Hyde Park, Allston,West Roxbury, Dorchester, mid-Dorchester, Roxbury, SouthBoston,China Town, Downtown, and Charlestown showing a positive value. This group ofneighborhoods was more resilient to the pandemic shock in a way that minimized thestagnation that would have affected their technological behavior.Fig. 4. Technological Resilience Measure.After describing the first layer of this analysis, we created the measure of the amountof investment per house unit based on the number of occupied houses. As discussedearlier in the methodology, a 100 USD per house unit was selected. Table 3 indicates therate of investment evolution on tech-related projects before and during the pandemic.300 P. Sohrabi et al.Fig. 5. Technological Resilience MeasureResults show two neighborhoods with higher investments, Mattapan, and Allston, 8and 4% increase, respectively. In the other 21 neighborhoods, however, the situation isdifferent (see Fig. 6). As a result of the pandemic, the budget was reduced by 3 to 100%through different neighborhoods compared to the pre-pandemic year. West Roxbury,Mid-Dorchester, and Hyde Park showed around roughly 5% reduction of investment.South End, Wharf District, and Chinatown show the lowest expenses compared to therest of the neighborhoods with 100, 68, and 62% decline, respectively.Before the pandemic, we see that Wharf District, Chinatown, West End, FenwayKenmore, and Back Bay were the neighborhoods with the highest investment, whileduring the pandemic, few changes in this order are observed. West End becomes theneighborhood with the highest number of green tech investments, followed by WharfDistrict, Fenway Kenmore, Chinatown, and Back Bay. However, the declines in pref-erences for investment in technology projects has varied among different groups ofneighbourhoods and it could be interpreted due to context-specific factors that we willbe explaining in the following paragraphs.First, we retrieved the City of Boston maps based on some socio-economic factorsand aligned them to ourwork (Figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12) to see any spatial concentrationand to try to see if these factors could be the reasons behind our results. Surprisingly,Fig. 9 shows how the highest “vacant unit ratio” neighborhoods are concentrated in theBoston center area. Figure 8 shows the poverty rate and that Fenway, Kenmore, MissionHills, Roxbury, and Dorchester are the highest in Boston. Then, we focused on a numberof variables that could have an impact on the neighbourhoods’ investments. The variablesthat are included in the analysis are vacant units’ ratio, white people’s ratio, median age,master’s degree ratio, graduation ratio per capita, income, poverty rate, population, andthe number of families.All in all, running an iterative multivariate regression helps interpret Table 3, whichdescribes why investment criteria vary among neighborhoods. Table 4 is a merged indexthat shows how the model works by comparing the so-called “100 USD per House”expenditure on tech-related projects.Navigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 301Table 3.

Considering that the significance F in the pre-pandemic periodis 0.001, we are able to consider the model relevant to the proposed hypothesis. Inthis way, we are able to establish a meaningful relationship between the technologicalexpenditure and the three pillars of indicators. The most significant coefficient is for the“vacant unit ratio” which is 81.755, which explains how neighborhoods with a largerratio of isolated buildings have the propensity to invest in tech-related projects. There isa negative 27,150 correlation between poverty rate and investment, which indicates thereverse relationship between these socio-economic factors.While the number of familiesand median age have relevant P-values, the coefficients are relatively small. The modelfor pre-pandemic period is as follows:Y = 81.755(vacant units ratio)+ 0.6613(median age)− 27.65(poverty rate)− 0.003(no. of families)302 P. Sohrabi et al.Fig. 6.

Vacant Units Fig. 10. White populationFig. 11. Number of Families Fig. 12. Median Household IncomeNext, we explore the post-pandemic period. We see that the R-squared and signifi-cance F are 67% and 0.033, respectively. On the one hand, we could observe the samemodel and relatively slight discrepancies in p-valves, but the coefficients are formeddifferently. It is essential to shedding light on the proportion of coefficient formations inpre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. For example, the falloff is more significant inthe “Poverty rate” from −27.65 to −6.52. Decreasing the share of the poverty-relatedrecession could pave the way for new research on neighborhood clustering topics forunderstanding community-level programs that rendered this amount of resiliency. Themodel for during-pandemic period is as follows:Y = 32.13(vacant units ratio)+ 0.377(median age)− 6.526(poverty rate)− 0.001(no. of families)In the last step, we look at the variables of MVR under the lens of transmutation ininvestment between pre-pandemic and post-pandemic to find out the most influencing304 P.

At first glance, the same variables are consideredsignificant but looking more in detail, we observed a more significant opposing footprintof poverty rate compared to post-pandemic analysis. Furthermore,wefindout the “vacantunit ratio” is the most significant factor here, followed by the same pattern of medianage & poverty rate. The change model is as follows:Y = 43.772(vacant units ratio)+ 0.168(median age)− 17.57(poverty rate)− 0.001(no. of families)While all neighbourhoods across Boston have dealt with navigating the challenges ofthe healthcare crisis, we clearly see that there are inequities in how different neighbour-hoods were able to achieve their green transition vision. Our model suggests that cityauthorities will need to address the challenges of low-income communities achievinggreen transition with more targeted programs.6 ConclusionFirst, we observed clustering phenomena by neighborhood’s tendency on tech-relatedproject continuation trend versus the permission of the general project requests among23 Bostonian neighborhoods. This finding could reveal the disparity among districts inthe same city regarding green transition. We tested this finding in the spatial context toperform an illustration of technological resilience mapping for policymakers.Second, for neighborhood groups, we suggested a measure of “100 USD per unit ofhousing” spent on tech-related projects. In this way, we captured neighborhoods’ size,Navigating the Green Transition During the Pandemic Equitably 305population, and housing density patterns to find a uniform measure in comparing them.After drawing districts’ behavior diagrams and their pre/post-pandemic observations,we noticed a pattern of transition among them; this leads us to conduct a model forthis phenomenon. Finally, to allocate scalable weight to each independent factor, we ranan MVR model and discussed the findings above. Suggesting a model despite resultsguides us to characterize groups of variables; these suggested pillars of ingredients offera perspective to qualitative research plans for conducting surveys within the suggestedneighborhoods to enhance the pillars. We believe there is more room for investigatingcommunity-level priorities and opportunities due to the diversity of Boston. Exercisingshock heat maps, known as resilience mapping, is a novel perspective in urban studiesinvestigating the flexibility of communities facing acute turbulence.Third, the final maps are created to call for more attention on structurally weakneighborhoods by policymakers and the communities to think again. The acute shockof the Pandemic enhanced the transition in structural change level. This phenomenonaddresses the socioeconomic disparity at the local level. As a team of researchers, webelieve the so-called post-carbon transition could be implemented locally. While thismicro-scale is obliged to follow global programming structures, the ability to revealinclusive shifts is a nexus between actors and places. Finally, we suggest spatial networkanalysis approach for the next steps of this research question on technological resilienceassessment by benefiting from a relatively long panel data analysis of neighborhoodbehavior [36]. In this paper, we suggested an MVR Model test and demonstrated thehypothesis on the lackof inclusiveness of transition basedon the spatial disparity betweenBostonian neighborhoods. In this way, there were limitations on expanding the pillarsto more flexible measures at the neighborhood level, which one can suggest as a novelperspective in big data for urban research.7 Limitations of the StudySurprisingly, looking at the model and pillars of the suggested variable, we could con-clude that race, despite of long history of being addressed as a discrimination factor,has no significant effect on this transition model. However, one could claim “povertyrate” and “white race ratio” have a collateral relationship; we could not find any inthis paper. Racial disparity is known as a risk factor in most American resilience plans.However, in the technological resilience domain, this could be addressed differently dueto the reasonably uniform access to federal and local government funds on tech-relatedprojects in the housing field. Although the highest R-squared is below 85%, this range’sconsistency allows us to generalize these findings as a call to map the city based onmore research-based factors. Enduring a most significant variable pattern with expen-diture (specifically on tech-related) layers on a dashboard could lead the policymakersto design an appropriate real-time and place-based plan for communities to prioritizeactions.Even if the differences in green technology investment didn’t translate to ethnic andracial differences in our model. We understand that looking only on the white populationratio is a starting point for our study. In a future study, it would worth it focusing moreon different ethnicities and races to explore how these can explain the neighbourhoods’tendency to invest in tech-related projects and ability to deal with green transition.306 P.
