Adaptivecapacities of farm systems are closely linked to how the farmer perceives the situationsto manage, according to his aims, to his behaviour face to risk and to his idea of whatis his job. We propose to use different words to describe the properties of farmingsystems to cope with changes, according to the level within the system: “adaptivecapacity” or “plasticity” for the animal level, “resilience” for the biotechnical level and“flexibility” for the whole system, including the manager.  We think there is a realchallenge working at each level on transition periods and processes, as farming systemswill have more and more to adapt face to unpredic events.Keywords: resilience, flexibility, adaptive capacities, uncertainty, crops systems, ani‐mal system© 2016 The Author(s).

IntroductionFarm businesses, just like any other business enterprise, develop response strategies in orderto cope with the many demands imposed on them and the uncertainties they face.  Thechallenge for farmers lies in securing sustainability for their business, in a context wherefarming is subject to wide‐reaching change and where farms are increasingly exposed toagronomic trends and climatic risks that the agricultural productivity model generally seeksto overcome by controlling processes and disengaging the effects of environmental disturb‐ance.Incorporating the precepts of sustainable development in order to build and assess newtechnical agricultural systems hinges on breaking away from the rationales underpinning thesesystems and moving towards more holistic objectives encompassing far more than the simpleproduction output function [1]. There are two key drivers to this breakaway: (i) reinventinghow researchers interact with the other actors involved in the process of developing newsystems and their multiple outcomes [2, 3], and (ii) producing tools capable of quicklyrendering a priori system assessments [4, 5] as a first step towards subsequently deploying thesystems in compliance with complex multicriteria specifications [6]. This means that agrono‐mists face the challenge of translating the impacts of integrating these dimensions into termsthat farmers can understand and use to reshape their farm systems, taking into account newsocial and environmental factors [7, 8].This reshaping redefines the farm business as a complex system that needs to be analysed notjust in terms of its type but also the rationales driving how it operates [9, 10]. A few years ago,farming system researchers started using the notion of flexibility to define the capacity of abusiness to weather and adapt to economic uncertainty. The concept of resilience, as pioneeredby Holling [11], has also been analysed in this setting, particularly when applied in more recentsocial‐ecological systems [12]. “Flexibility” has been researched extensively in managementscience and industrial economics, whereas “resilience” has mainly been used in ecology (butalso in social psychology; [13]). Our study will draw on illustrative examples to highlight howthe notion of flexibility can prove useful for designing and assessing innovative technicalsystems.2. Flexibility in management sciencesIndustrial economics and management sciences understand the concept of flexibility [14, 15]as the capacity of a business or organization to re‐adapt its structure and projects in responseto environmental challenges (strategic flexibility) and to re‐adapt its skillsbase, reorganize itsworkflows (workflow flexibility) and/or adjust its production methods as a response tounforeseen variations in inputs from outside (operational flexibility). The concept thereforeappears relevant when analysing farmers’ response strategies in the current climate governingagricultural production (characterized by regulatory developments, volatile agriculturalprices, climatic variability, etc.). Tarondeau [15] (ibid.) stratified different sources of flexibility:Livestock Science2product flexibility (product range), process flexibility and inputs flexibility. The basic idea isthat the capacity to cope with unknowns and carry the business forward is dependent onseveral factors, both material and non‐material: the configurations of their technical productionsystems, their structures, their projects and their objectives [16]. Reix et al. [17] suggest that thedrive for flexibility can be seen as the drive to maintain consistency in how the business ismanaged in response to a changing environment. Flexibility, as a system property, is not“given”: it is built, shaped and “nurtured,” and it has a cost [18]. Flexibility can be considereda competitive advantage insofar as it enables performance levels to be sustained in situationsof uncertainty [19].Different commentators use different terms as synonymous with or acceptances of the conceptof flexibility, but there is a body of ideas that remain recurrent. Flexibility refers to organiza‐tional capacity [14, 15, 20–23, 28]. This means that the systems described are always manage‐ment‐led and that the organizational procedures governing their management constitute asource of flexibility for the system. In each case, flexibility is defined as an attribute that isinherent to humans, dependent on how they perceive situations to be addressed, theirobjectives, their level of risk aversion and the perception they hold of their business. Flexibilityis a property that has to associate both change and stability, forming a paradox betweenpermanence (continuity, mainstay) and change [16]. The authors see management flexibilityas the result of constructive tension between what needs to be held onto and what needschanging. This same idea has been explored through analyses of how livestock farmingsystems work, with the notion of invariants [24]. The invariant acts as a backbone, a basis, abottom line and the frame of reference for handling change (not everything has to change atthe same time, otherwise the system risks getting disorganized or even collapsing into chaos).Flexibility is intrinsically dynamic. It can only be meaningfully studied in the long term, atmultiperiod scale. Integrating flexibility into the analysis of a system or an organizationpresupposes that the decision‐maker is looking to achieve short‐term objectives while alsosecuring a range of opportunities for the longer term [25]. In other words, a given decision mayappear non‐rational (or non‐optimal) when analysed at timepoint t, but become entirelyrational once events liable to arise at some point in the future are factored in (uncertaintypreparedness). Indeed, the speed of response to these events is one of the key components offlexibility [15].Furthermore, in every scenario, the concept of flexibility is also linked to the notion ofinteraction between the system/organization and its environment. It can therefore be measuredand thus assessed, by quantifying the degree of control (according to the dual flexibilityconcept proposed by De Leeuw and Volberda [20]: controlled systems vs. independentsystems) over environmental inputs (Figure 1).The two paradigms coexist within a single system (controlling‐controlled) and must thereforebe analysed in tandem. However, the extent to which one paradigm dominates the otherreveals specific system behaviours.The organization as an environment‐controlled system: in this configuration, the organization“copes with” environmental factors [16]. Flexibility hinges on accommodative processes [26],which hallmarks defensive behaviour in response to external perturbation [27]. The targetSecuring Sustainable Livestock Production Systems in an Uncertain Economic Climate: Nurturing...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/650873objective for the system will be adaptation, stability, resilience to environmental forces androbustness. Systems unable to achieve this objective would be defined as vulnerable.Figure 1. Organization of an environment‐controlled system (left) and an environment‐independent system (right)(concepts taken from Ref. [20]). TS = target system; CO = controlling organ. The arrows illustrate the direction of controlexerted by the CO over the TS.The organization as an environment‐independent system: in this configuration, the organiza‐tion seeks to subordinate all changes in its environment to the task of maintaining its objectivesand its identity. Interactions with the environment are specified internally, and on a certainlevel, the environment is integrated into the organization. The processes deployed in the searchfor flexibility are assimilative processes, which hallmarks a pro‐active pattern of behaviourthat will respond to each perturbation by generating new behaviours, thereby expanding therange of adaptation options possible. These configurations define self‐learning organizationswith self‐directed learning capacities.Figure 2. Different types of flexibility according to the number of planned procedures (vertical axis) and the speed atwhich they can be implemented (horizontal axis); adapted from Ref. [28].De Leeuw and Volberda [20] encapsulated these two configurations by defining flexibility interms of diversity of procedures and the speed at which they can be mobilized: (i) to increasethe organization's environmental control capacities and (ii) to decrease the organization'sLivestock Science4environmental vulnerability. The authors define different types of flexibility according to thenumber of planned procedures and the speed at which they can be implemented (Figure 2).3. Social‐ecological resilience: a kind of flexibility?The concept of resilience is borrowed from material physics as well as ecology as a means ofdescribing the transformation and/or adaptive capacity of a material or ecosystem in responseto stressors. In ecology, Holling [11] described resilience as the capacity of an ecological systemor species to absorb challenges and then recover its initial configuration. The concept wasthen broadened to encompass shifts, learning and human‐nature interactions [29]. Resiliencewas then extended to describe the mechanics of “anthropized” systems [30]. More recently,the concept of resilience has been applied to social‐ecological systems, where humans are agoverning actor [2, 12, 31–33]. The system is thus considered as a “learner,” with a shift in theunderlying idea from a return to the initial state following the perturbation towards a capacityto reconfigure itself while maintaining the core objectives and projects, where stakeholderscan continue to plan for the future [2]. According to Ref. [34], there are three potentialstrategies capable of increasing the resilience of actively governed systems: increasing thesystem's buffer capacity (room for manoeuvre), scale‐based governance (spatial and temporalscales) and creating opportunity for innovation (sources of change to system properties,learning capacity). These systems therefore have the ability to respond to perturbation byshifting into different stability domains rather than a single, “initial” steady state.Walker et al. [35] outlined four main features of system resilience connected to the notions ofsteady state and initial state: (i) the amount of change that the system can tolerate withoutcollapsing into an essentially different state, this idea works on the assumption that there is athreshold beyond which the system can no longer recover its initial configuration; (ii) thecapacity to resist change, which is connected to properties like rigidity and robustness; (iii)vulnerability (precariousness), which is how close the system state is to the threshold citedunder point 1; (iv) panarchy, which describes a system integrating a great many elementsundergoing cross‐scale interactions, and that the level of resilience depends on the differentstates and dynamics interplaying at the scales above and below.Resilience can also be described in terms of successive system states over time. Holling [36]and Walker et al. [2] consider that ecological systems follow adaptive cycles comprising foursuccessive phases. They posit that actively governed systems reproduce cyclic patterns ofbehaviour aligned to these four phases: a phase of accelerated growth (annotated r), followedby a longer phase of steady accumulation towards stability, associated with a progressivedecline in resilience (K), then a sharp structural collapse (Ω) before another short phase ofrebuilding and reorganization (α). Depending on the current phase of the system, a givendisturbance (which can in fact be seen positively as the introduction of an accommodativestance) will not have the same effect.Securing Sustainable Livestock Production Systems in an Uncertain Economic Climate: Nurturing...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/6508754. Leverages to enhance flexibility in livestock systems4.1. Different levers according to scaleAaker and Mascarenhas [37] focusing on the means to enhance organizational flexibilityoutlined the following four levers centred on products, resources and management: (i)diversification of processes, business activities and products, running from broadening therange but also including activity in different marketplaces and extended use of differentprocess technologies. In Ref. [38], the authors assert their notion of “relational flexibility” toaccount for the sources of adaptive capacity employed by livestock farmers through theirmarketing networks and the circuits they build or exploit to sell livestock; (ii) increasing inter‐independence between production units; (iii) developing a base of potentially useful resourcesthat are deployed not continually but on a case‐by‐case basis “should the need arise”: func‐tional redundancies, latent competencies, room for manoeuvre; (iv) minimizing workflowspecialization, steering away from situations where tasks are accomplished by staff who havecompetencies deemed “necessary and sufficient” to complete the task. For example, Madel‐rieux et al. [39] clearly illustrate the flexibility achievable by a more collective workplaceorganization and workload breakdown in livestock farming systems.Using two examples of farm systems (crop and livestock), we illustrate how these flexibilityleverages can be deployed to minimize vulnerability to changes in the systems’ environments.These two examples were chosen to demonstrate how the internal organization of the system(the sequencing of the system's structural components) and the system manager's perceptionof the environment act as complementary leverage for lending flexibility to farm productionsystems.4.2. Animal contribution (plasticity) to system flexibility in an organic dairy systemThe Mirecourt (INRA) research team prototypes sustainable dairy systems focused on agro‐environmental sustainability. One system, tested since 2004, is a low‐input grass‐only system,in accordance with the specifications governing organic farming and based on the hypothesisthat pasture‐based systems are more sustainable [40].This system is designed to introduce rulesets and animal and farmland management modesfor achieving the objectives assigned to the system at the outset. In other words, the systemaims to define how to achieve a result targeted at the outset without having to run through theconventional pattern of conducting experimental trials to measure results from differentmanagement condition sets established at the outset. Systems employing this strategy aredesigned to be sustainable in agro‐environmental terms. More operationally, we posit that inorder to cope with these objectives, the systems have to be self‐sufficient (no importation offertilizers or pesticides) and able to cope with unanticipated events, especially climatic events,since self‐sufficiency can render systems more sensitive to natural variations in farmlandproperties.The herd breed is split equally between two breeds (Holstein and Montbeliarde) in order totest the capacities of each breed to enable the system to achieve the objectives set. MaximizingLivestock Science6grazed grass in the cow diet led to grouped calvings in late winter (February to April) in orderto match the animals’ energy requirements with grass availability. Under this managementpolicy, cows produced 5132 kg milk/cow/year on average in 2005 and 2006: Holstein cowsmilked on average 400 kg milk/cow/year higher than Montbéliarde cows (respectively 5347and 4947 kg milk/cow/year). However, at the end of the breeding period, 65% of dairy cowswere pregnant in 2005 but only 27% at the corresponding timepoint in 2006. These very poorratios affected herd sustainability, even though performance levels for replacement heiferswere better (Table 1).Year 2005 2006Herd Hn Mo Herd Hn MoCows Success AI1 and AI2 (%)1 54 38 75 23 8 33 Fertility (%)2 65 52 81 27 17 33Heifers Success AI1 and AI2 (%) 79 80 78 71 75 67 Fertility (%) 86 80 89 88 75 100Hn: Holstein; Mo: Montbeliarde; AI: artificial insemination.1Percentage of pregnant cows served once or twice.2Percentage of animals calving after being served during the breeding period.Table 1. Reproductive performances of dairy cows in 2005 and 2006, according to breed.An analysis of individual animal management within the cow herd highlighted differentgroups. Each group corresponds to a specific calving date, which, in relation to turnout date,determines the feed diet at the beginning of lactation: a switch from winter feed to pasturegrass.The milk production of dairy cows calved after turnout increased very quickly (2–4 weeks) tomaximum daily production, generating high energy requirements, which is detrimental toreproduction. The milk production of dairy cows calving at least one month before turnoutshowed a slower increase to maximum daily production (taking 8–12 weeks), with a smoothereffect on energy balance and reproduction. Within these two configurations, Montbeliardecows gave smoother lactation curves than Holstein cows (Figure 3). They were able to limitmilk production, even when stimulated by turnout to grass, and thus gave better reproductionperformances than Holstein cows.In the grass‐based systems, Montbeliarde cows offer more plasticity than Holstein cows.Secondly, shifting the calving period (January to March instead of February to April) shouldmaximize the number of calvings before turnout to grass, thus lending the system moreflexibility by enhancing reproductive performance.Securing Sustainable Livestock Production Systems in an Uncertain Economic Climate: Nurturing...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/650877Figure 3.

The collective workflows lever: flexibility in response to market uncertaintyThe flexibility of suckler cattle farms is induced by commercial circuits: one of the features ofsuckler cattle farms is that they offer the possibility of selling livestock, and particularlyfemales, at virtually any age. There are potentially over 15 different categories, with somebreeders selling a minimal number of animal categories (n = 3: male calves, female calves andcows), whereas other systems offer a broader range comprising four or more differentcategories. Some systems always produce the same types of animal, whereas others gearthemselves with options to change in response to climate events or market openings. There isalso a heavy and practically range‐independent variability in the number of buyers for theanimals produced (Figure 4): a 2005 survey sampling livestock farmers ranged from one buyerfor all animals up to seven different partners. Over and above buyer numbers, buyer status isalso a critical criterion for livestock breeders. We have identified two different sets of strate‐gic choices:• Cooperatives vs. private buyers: some livestock farmers are convinced that cooperatives robthem of their freedom to market their products and thus refuse to help finance the runningcosts (premiums), in contrast to other farmers who strongly believe the cooperativerepresents their best interests, offering them a voice and a channel through which they canLivestock Science8take action if problems arise. Finally, there is another category of livestock farmers whoattach little importance to buyer status and who choose to sell their animals based on theprices they can get and how well they know and trust the buyer;• Single buyer vs. several buyers: for farmers who work with a single buyer, the driving factoris the relationship of trust: the buyer understands how the farmer works and knows whatanimals are produced: negotiations are relatively straightforward, and sometimes a phonecall is all that is needed. While the cattle farmer does need to make efforts to protect thisspecial relationship (trust‐system payments, sales spread across the year, etc.), in return theycan expect the buyer to step in and make priority purchases when business is bad (securityfactor). In contrast, other farmers see the option of juggling between buyers as a way to takeadvantage of competition. If the market goes through a crisis, the farmer hopes to weatherthe storm by having a number of available buyers in order to sell their total livestock.Figure 4. Different farmer (F) strategies for animal sales in livestock farming systems, combining range and number ofpurchasers (P); (one arrow corresponds to one specific category of animals sold, i.e. culled cows, weaned calves, hei‐fers, bulls and steers).The components of biophysical systems (plants, animals and soils; Figure 5) confer a relativelygreater level of system‐wide flexibility through their own, intrinsic properties: (i) delayeddifferentiation process: unicity, particularly for females from suckler cattle breeds, regardlessof their end purpose and their age at sale [41]; (ii) plasticity, breed diversity and ability to adaptto different management strategies [42, 43]. Gaillard et al. [44] showed how Simmental breeddiversity offered dairy farmers options to take up a more or less marked position on theSecuring Sustainable Livestock Production Systems in an Uncertain Economic Climate: Nurturing...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/650879intensified fodder system gradient, ranging from extensive 100% grassland systems tointensive corn silage‐based systems.Depending on the flexibility leverage deployed by the farmer [7], both the system compo‐nents (structural dimensions) and their interplays (functional dimensions) will take on acertain measure of specificity. Furthermore, this distinction picks up on the distinctionmade by Alcaras and Lacroux [16] between the stability of an organization's structure andthe stability of an organization's target objectives: (i) the “size” lever: reproductive capaci‐ties, useful lifespan and carcass yield, for animals that farmers can no longer select to workwith once they opt to increase the size of their holding through internal growth (zero buy‐in); (ii) the “responsiveness” lever (short‐range opportunity‐taking): versatility, ability tohandle change (feed type and volume), malleability, breed mix, capacities for out‐of‐seasonproduction; (iii) the “collective workflows/technicity” lever: quantitative performance,standardized high‐tech information system, records; (iv) the “room for manoeuvre” lever:versatility, simplicity, hardiness.Figure 5. Descriptors assigned to adaptive capacities according to level of organization in the functional analysis ofproduction systems.5. Discussion and conclusionThe foundations of resilience analysis have progressively shifted towards the foundations offlexibility analysis. Our assertion is based on qualifying the set of properties that will enablea system to secure sustainability by restricting the use of the two terms to different levels oforganization (Figure 5): “flexibility” to cover the level overarching the entire productionLivestock Science10system and “resilience” to cover the underlying level of the biophysical (or operant learning)system. The terms used at the next level down, comprising the organic system entities such asplants and animals, would be “plasticity” and “adaptive capacity” as employed in Ref. [42].The three examples of production systems highlighted earlier share a common denominatorin that they are all “extensive” systems, that is, where productivity per surface unit of land isnot maximized compared to intensive systems. A clear pattern emerged, wherein the adaptivecapacities of these systems are perceived differently under the two scenarios. The design anddevelopment of intensive systems (high production per surface unit of land) consisted then,as now, in targeting measures capable of absorbing the negative effects of increasing perform‐ance. This means that for the animals, the primary property needed is “robustness,” that is,the ability to produce a lot and regularly, regardless of the environmental disturbances.The levers that farmers can deploy to protect their management systems against marketuncertainty will differ depending on farmer standpoints, objectives, lessons learned, thecollective organizations they work with, the standards and specifications they work to, etc.Therefore, in order to properly analyse the attributes of systems that make them less vulnerableto unknowns, the focus should be directed towards the information systems employed by farmsystem managers [45]. It is equally important to identify the interplays between overarchingand underlying scale levels for the system studied (panarchy) and to hone in on the dynamicsat work during periods of transition.Literature review combined with the examples compiled reveals that studies directed atdevelopments and changes in farm systems harnessing ecological‐biological (animals, plants,etc.) and human‐social (farmers’ strategies and objectives) dimensions can use the notion offlexibility to gain a sharper and more explicit analysis of the interactions between thesedimensions.The move to revitalize the analytical framework governing livestock farming systems has toexplicitly factor in dimensions stemming from interactions between animal production scienceand social sciences (formalization of livestock farmer strategies, workflow organization; [46])as well as between ecology (resilience) and management science (flexibility). The target is tocombine the analytical perspectives on (i) the regulatory properties of management‐ledbiological systems (such as the herd, whose dynamics are shaped by interactions betweenhuman decisions and the biological functions of the animals; [43, 47]) and the leverages capableof parrying the effects of climatic risks and economic unknowns (types of product, relationswith downstream factors, socio‐technical networks).There has been a key turning point in the way agronomics researchers have addressed theissue of performance in farm production systems. There has been a move away from focusingon ways to control or increase quantitative performance metrics (although there are shades ofecological intensification policy that still encourage this kind of outlook; [48]) and towardsother rationales, such as “multicriteria” system design and assessment frameworks. Lookingat the issues left unresolved and the various standpoints on offer, we have identified at leasttwo courses of action:Securing Sustainable Livestock Production Systems in an Uncertain Economic Climate: Nurturing...http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/6508711• The interplay, or rather the fitting of abilities between production system components(system entities) and the type of system environment. This standpoint leads to a subsequentissue of whether there are advantages to be drawn from preserving certain specific animalor plant genotype characteristics that are underrepresented or tend to pale in comparisonwhen balanced against the yield capacities of different breeds and the so‐called improvedcrop varieties.• The advantages of mixed farm systems combining different animal breeds/plant species,where the farmer is hedging on complementarity between the properties of each breed/species to cope with climatic unknowns (species offering different hardiness or whichdevelop at different periods of the year) or variations in market prices (which have differenteffects on different farm outputs).Approaches based on concepts and theories borrowed from disciplines such as ecology andmanagement science are particularly fruitful for fuelling reflective thinking and reframinganalyses in agronomics science when the aim is to investigate the dynamics of change and theadaptability of farm in response to situations of uncertainty.For farmers, the art of farm management resides in tackling head‐on how they define andreadjust the production objectives set, how they lead negotiations with other farm stakeholdersin order to achieve these objectives given the resources available, how they tackle uncertaintyand how they tackle opportunity. These are all complex adaptation processes occurring at theinterface between the farm and its environment, which emerge not only in the decisions takenbut also in the short‐term and long‐term practices that we have termed “flexibility.” Ouranalysis of these processes applied to three real‐world systems enabled us to highlight ahandful of principles governing farm business flexibility. First, the situational contextualiza‐tion: flexibility is dependent not only on the technical features of the production systemcomponents (plasticity) but also on the socio‐economic environment in which the businessesevolve; second comes the collectiveness component: flexibility becomes greater as the businessintegrates the collective dimension of farm activity, even if the overriding aim is to maintaindecision‐making autonomy over the production system. Finally, from the methodologystandpoint, trials led at our experimental farm station have prompted us to continue investi‐gations into methods for qualifying and if possible even quantifying the sustainability of farmstructures in interaction with their environment, factoring in the different farm‐structuringorganizational levels. This research will ultimately be used for inter‐farm comparisonsintegrating on‐farm production system adaptability over time.AcknowledgementsThis work was carried out with the financial support of the “ANR—Agence Nationale de laRecherche—The French National Research Agency” under the “Programme Agriculture etDéveloppement Durable,” project “ANR‐05‐PADD‐04‐01, Discotech.”Livestock Science12Author detailsStéphane Ingrand1,2,3,4*, Laura Astigarraga5, Eduardo Chia6, Xavier Coquil7,Christophe David8 and Jean‐Louis Fiorelli7*Address all correspondence to: stephane.ingrand@clermont.inra.fr1 Inra, UMR, Métafort, Méthamis, France2 Agro Paris Tech, UMR, Aubière, France3 Irstea, UMR, Aubière, France4 Clermont Université, VetAgro Sup, UMR, Clermont‐Ferrand, France5 Universidad de la Republica, Facultad de Agronomia, Montevideo, Uruguay6 UMR Innovation, Montpellier Cedex, France7 Inra UR Aster, Mirecourt, France8 Isara, Lyon Cedex, FranceReferences[1] Sabatier R, Durant D, Hazard L, Lauvie A, Lecrivain E, Magda D, Martel G, Roche B,de Sainte Marie C, Teillard F, Tichit M.
