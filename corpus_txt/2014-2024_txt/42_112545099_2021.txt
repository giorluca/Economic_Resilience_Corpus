Introduction 
As the COVID-19 pandemic stretches on, the importance of resilience is increasing as it protects 
against PTSD while aiding an individual in selecting healthy coping strategies. In a study of 657 
healthcare workers in New York City in April 2020, more than half of healthcare workers 
screened positive for acute stress (PTSD symptoms), almost half screened positive for 
depression, and one third screened positive for anxiety; many also reported symptoms of 
insomnia (Schecter et al., 2020). 
Resilience is important in nursing because it ensures a viable, healthy workforce for the future. 
Resilience has been described as the ability to ‘bounce back’ or effectively cope with adversity. 
The literature shows that resilience has been studied only related to chronic problems such as 
staffing issues, however, until this year; it has not been studied in the context of pandemics. 
Background
Duncan (2020) has recognized that resilience in staff [is] a critical attribute of a strong healthcare 
system, which requires long-term investment and sustained attention once a crisis 
abates. Resilience is important in nursing because it ensures a viable, healthy workforce for the 
future. Previous research on resilience has focused on chronic issues such as staffing shortages, 
but it has not been examined in the context of disasters (Duncan, 2020).  
The concept refers to the means and ability for effective adjustment or to cope successfully with 
adverse circumstances (Lin et al., 2020). Resilience can be viewed as either a process or a 
personality trait (Duncan, 2020). 
Resilience is protective against post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which makes it of 
particular importance during the current pandemic (Duncan, 2020). Anxiety and depression are 
also inversely related to resilience (Jin et al., 2020). As described by Lin et al. (2020): ...nurses’ 
resilience scored lower than doctors and other support staff.  Given the workload of nurses 
during the pandemic and the level of close contact with patients, the differences in resilience 
between nurses and other medical workers were not unexpected. 
Purpose
The purpose of the study was to examine and describe the perceived resilience of nursing staff at 
a regional hospital who were working during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Materials and Methods
This was a paper-and-pencil survey study conducted at Mid Coast Hospital. 
Instrument
The data were collected using the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC).  The selected 
tool was the ten-item version to facilitate participation. Permission to use the scale was obtained 
1
through email from Johnathan Davidson (July 17, 2020).    
The CD-RISC consists of ten items on a five-point scale where zero signifies ‘not true at all’ and 
four means ‘true nearly all the time’. Total scores indicates resilience; the higher the total score, 
the higher level of resilience is in the participant (min 4; max 40). Moreover, CD-RISC measures 
six components of resilience: (1) the ability to adapt to change, (2) deal with what comes along 
(3) cope with stress (4) to stay focused and think clearly (5) to not get discouraged in the face of 
failure and (6) to handle unpleasant feelings such as anger, pain or sadness.
The CD-RISC has been widely used and the psychometric data on validity, reliability and factor 
structure have been obtained in various studies worldwide (Ahern, Kiehl, Sole & Byers, 2006). 
Data Collection 
After the IRB approval, recruitment flyers were distributed at the hospital [where?] inviting the 
staff to participate the survey. The survey packages and a box for completed surveys were 
distributed to different units (i.e. Emergency Department, Intensive Care Units [ICU], Inpatient 
[non-ICU], Outpatient, COVID 19, and other units). The packages included an invitation letter, a 
paper survey (CD-RISC) and a background information sheet. Altogether 109 packages were 
distributed and 69 competed surveys were returned (response rate 63%) .  
A completed survey constituted consent to participate in the study. Participation in the study was 
voluntary and anonymous. 
Data Analysis
The data were exported from Excel database into SPSS, version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, 
USA). The data were analyzed statistically using descriptive and non-parametric tests. P values 
<0.05 were considered statistically significant. 
Ethical Review
This expedited study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (protocol 20-09-1551) in 
October 18, 2020. 
Results
Respondent Demographics 
Majority of the respondents were RNs (95.7%) and represented two age groups of 25-34 years 
(27.5%) and 55-64 years (27.5%). Most of the study subjects had over five years of work 
experience (78.3%). Almost half of the respondents (44.9%) worked in an inpatient unit (non-
ICU), 26.1% in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 17.4% in Energy Department. (Table 1.)

Resilience 
The respondents’ answers to the CD-RISC-10 questions were first examined item-by-item. The 
lowest found score (Q8: mean 2.42, SD .946) focused on experiences of failure and the highest 
score (Q1: mean 3.33, SD .679) on adaptability. The total score (average) was obtained by 
adding up all 10 items and dividing the sum by the number of respondents. In the sample of all 
respondents, the total mean score was 29.74 (SD 5.64). This mean score, according to the cut-off 
points suggested in CD-RISC manual, is in the second quartile of the average/nominal score 
distribution, and may suggest problems in coping with stress or bouncing back from adversity.  
In almost half of the respondents (46.4%), the total score was ≤ 29. (Table 2.)

Hardiness portrayed by different aspects of resilience 
The instrument, CD-RISC-10 consists of 10 statements describing different aspects of resilience. 
The scale serves mainly as a measure of hardiness, with items corresponding to flexibility (1 and 
5), sense of self-efficacy (2, 4 and 9), ability to regulate emotions (10), optimism (3,6 and 8) and 
cognitive focus/maintaining attention under stress (7). 
The mean scores for the aspects of resilience were calculated by adding the scores and dividing 
the sum by the number of items. In the respondents, the lowest resilience score was found in 
‘Ability to regulate emotions’ (mean 2.80, SD .815) and the highest in ‘Flexibility’ (mean 3.28, 
SD .645). (Table 3.) 
 
Table 3. Aspects of resilience 
Aspects of resilience Mean SD
Flexibility (2 items) 3.28 .645
Sense of self-efficacy (3 items) 2.97 .664
Ability to regulate emotions (1 item) 2.80 .815
Optimism (3 items) 2.89 .620
Cognitive focus/maintaining attention under stress (1 item) 2.93 .649
Resilience, age, work experience and practice setting 
Resilience was examined next in the different age, work experience and practice setting groups 
using non-parametric tests. Statistically significant differences (p <.05) were found in 
‘flexibility’ between the age groups. This aspect of resilience was lowest in the age group of 35-
44 years and highest in the group of 65 ≥ years. No other significant differences in resilience 
were found between the age groups. An interesting finding was that, when comparing the 
respondent groups based on the work experience, no statistically significant differences were 
found. The lowest total resilience scores were found in the ‘Outpatient, COVID 19’ unit ‘ICU’, 
followed by ‘Inpatient (non-ICU) units and ED. The findings suggest that there were statistically 
significant differences (p<.05) in ‘flexibility’ between the practice settings. ‘Flexibility’ was 
4
lowest in ‘Outpatient COVID 19’ unit and highest in the ‘Other’ units. Examination of resilience 
between different practice settings was challenging, because of the low response rates from some 
units.
Conclusions and Recommendations
The CD-RISC-10 is intended neither to provide diagnostic information, nor to indicate that 
treatment or counselling is required. However, in conjunction with other assessments, it can 
provide useful information in deciding whether/what intervention is appropriate. A total score in 
the lowest or second quartile may suggest problems in coping with stress or bouncing back from 
adversity.
