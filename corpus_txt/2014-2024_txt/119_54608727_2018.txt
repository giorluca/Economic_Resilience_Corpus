Using farm survey data and aggregated time-series data from four states in southernIndia, this study examines factors influencing productivity in finger millet cultivation. A farm-levelyield gap analysis is complemented by an analysis of total factor productivity (TFP) growth between1999 and 2014 to better understand the role of research and innovation. Results suggest that there isconsiderable potential for improved growing practices to achieve better yields, but also educationlevels and technical support emerge as crucial factors for boosting finger millet productivity. The TFPanalysis indicates a moderate level of growth, with a high variability and conflicting trends betweenstates, suggesting a need to invest more in research and development, extension and infrastructure.Sustained productivity gains will require research efforts that respond to the needs expressed byfarmers and that finger millet forms part of an overall strategy for sustainable intensification.Keywords: finger millet; total factor productivity; tornqvist-theil index; yield gap analysis1. IntroductionAgricultural research, development and policy continues to place a strong emphasis on increasingproduction of the three main staple crops (rice, wheat and maize); whilst public and private investmentin other crops remains low [1]. There is a need for increased diversification of crop production to betteraddress the issues of climate change, land degradation and sustainable diets. The combined potentialof millets as both resilient crops for resource-constrained farmers and as a nutritious foodstuff forgrowing populations is huge across Asia and Africa [2–4]. Hence, millets are slowly being rediscoveredby the agricultural research and development community. For instance, Bioversity International andthe M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation have worked since 2000 towards mainstreaming milletsin India (https://www.bioversityinternational.org/news/detail/millet-revolution-in-india-lets-keep-up-the-momentum/).The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) isnow actively promoting them as “smart food” (http://www.icrisat.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Smart-food-flyer_Global_web.pdf). Policy-makers in India have also responded by incorporatingmillets into the National Food Security Act in 2013, making them available at a subsidised rate [5].Agriculture 2018, 8, 131; doi:10.3390/agriculture8090131 www.mdpi.com/journal/agricultureAgriculture 2018, 8, 131 2 of 12Minor millets are particularly neglected in terms of research and development. Their potentialfor climate smart agriculture and enhanced nutrition is also underexploited. Accounting for less than1% of grains produced globally, they are nevertheless essential for food security in their respectiveagro-ecosystems, which are often marginal areas [6]. Minor millets are adapted to a range of growingconditions, mature quickly and are better able to withstand climatic extremes. High in micronutrients,including calcium, iron and dietary fibre, they also offer a greater variety of vitamins, contain moreantioxidants and have more usable protein than wheat, rice or maize [2,4,7,8].Finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) is the most widespread minor millet and an important staplefood in many parts of India and Africa [9]. Across southern India, finger millet, locally known asragi, traditionally played a central role in agriculture and diets. In recent decades it has, however,been on the decline. Despite the many positive characteristics, the area planted reduced by circa 20%and production declined by 18% between 1997 and 2013 [10]. However, it is still widely grown inKarnataka state (671,000 ha in 2013) and to a lesser extend in other states, such as Andhra Pradesh,Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu (286,000 ha altogether in 2013). These figures are in contrast with thosefor wheat and rice, for which production increases exceeded 20% in India during the same period.Boosting crop diversification with minor millets requires an integrated strategy to overcome arange of obstacles. There is an apparent lack of awareness regarding its nutritional qualities amongconsumers. Furthermore, inadequate support by decision-makers has resulted in limited investmentinto research and development, as well as extension services [2,11]. Neglect of minor millets means thatfarmers growing them obtain lower returns as compared to other crops; however, there are substantialopportunities for increasing productivity and general economic performance. While annual yieldincreases in staples like rice and wheat are below 1% now and falling, the potential for yield increasesin underutilised crops is substantial. Padulosi et al. [8] argue that directing greater research attentionto nutritious cereals like millets would be a highly strategic and viable choice. It can offer great benefitsin terms of lower input requirements, adaptation to climate change, and cultivation of marginal soils,along with social gains in terms of enhanced self-reliance of local populations and more resilientfood systems. The authors affirm that, specifically with regard to minor millets, the yield gap islargely a reflection of existing cultivation techniques, for which ample room for improvement exists [8].For example, optimised seeding can enhance yields and reduce menial fieldwork, especially amongwomen, who play a key role in finger millet production. In this regard, well-functioning advisoryservices are of great importance.Systematic studies of the determinants of productivity in minor millets are lacking. While fingermillet yields have increased by 13% over the last decade in India, our farm survey data shows that theaverage yield gap between the best and lowest performing crops is considerable, lying at above 40% onaverage. It is thus essential to better understand the factors constraining productivity growth. Using alarge farm household dataset, this paper examines the determinants of the yield gap in finger milletin southern India and identifies factors for tackling the disparity between the agronomic potentialand the yields commonly achieved by the majority of farmers. To further examine the productivityof finger millet, we complement the farm-level yield gap assessment with an analysis of the trendsin total factor productivity (TFP) growth at state level. Using publicly available data and followingthe approach proposed by the US Department of Agriculture [12], this analysis provides evidenceof how far general productivity trends are driven by factors other than land expansion or inputintensification. TFP reflects how efficiently inputs are transformed into outputs. Improvements in TFPare the result of technological change, improved technical and allocative efficiency in resource use,and scale economies [12]. A recent G20 white paper [13] highlights that productivity analysis basedon accurate measurement of agricultural TFP is critical to identifying areas for improving policies thatcan influence long-term productivity growth in agriculture. These include investments in research anddevelopment, provision of advisory and financial services to promote the uptake of innovations, andthe development of farmers’ capacity to realise the potential of innovation.Agriculture 2018, 8, 131 3 of 12The paper continues in the next section by describing the study area and giving some details onthe farm data that were collected, followed by an account of how yield gap and TFP were analysed.The subsequent section describes the results of the study. The paper concludes with a discussion ofthese results and conclusions.2. Material and Methods2.1. Study Area and Farm-Level Data CollectionAs part of the Indo-Swiss Collaboration in Biotechnology (ISCB) project, the University ofAgricultural Sciences, Bangalore, and the National Academy of Agricultural Research Managementconducted a detailed farm household survey in 2016. Finger millet production information and selectedhousehold data were collected from 764 farms in southern India covering the four states where fingermillet is most widely grown: Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu. Together,these four states account for a finger millet cultivation area of circa 957,000 ha [2013 data], which is83 % of the cultivated area across India. This area provides the agricultural basis for approximately1,830,000 finger millet growers.Regarding data collection, a cluster sampling approach was applied. In a first step, the districtswith important finger millet production were purposively selected from among the 110 districts inthe four aforementioned states. This was based on the criterion that the finger millet production areain the district exceeds 5000 ha. The selection resulted in a sub-set of 9 districts representing a fingermillet cultivation area of circa 436,000 ha and a total number of approximately 800,000 finger milletgrowers. In a second step, a random sample of finger millet growers was approached in each of thesedistricts, using set sampling numbers. Since these numbers in the district sub-samples are not directlyindicative of the total number of finger millet growers per district or in the entire population, samplingweights were applied. The inverse probability of the selection of districts and finger millet growerswas used to address the known shortcomings inherent in the sampling approach and more adequatelyreflect the importance of individual sampling units.Prior to performing the yield gap analysis, data were cleaned and variables precisely specifiedto ensure full comparability between states. Data cleaning included the removal of severe outliers,identified as values higher than the upper quartile plus 3 times the interquartile range. These valueswere eliminated from the regression analysis. Nevertheless, the number of observations availablefor the regression analysis remained high at 723. For a number of continuous independent variables(labour, machine labour use, mineral fertiliser, and manure fertiliser) a logarithmic transformation wasused to normalise the distribution and to further reduce the effect of any outliers. To prevent zerovalue observations from being lost in the analysis, they were replaced by half the minimum non-zeroquantity before taking logarithms. Due to the extreme non-normal distribution, the irrigation variablewas transformed into a categorical variable. Consequently, two dummy variables were introducedin the regression (moderate and intensive irrigation), while no use was omitted. Farm householdcharacteristics in the analysis included farm size, poverty status, as well as the age and education ofthe household head. Education was recorded in terms of level of qualifications achieved. Therefore,dummy variables were used to specify three education levels: no formal education, medium educationcorresponding to attendance of primary and middle school, and high education corresponding tosecondary schooling and above. To examine the role of technical support for farmers by either stateor private advisory services, a dummy variable indicating a perceived lack of such support wasintroduced in the analysis. Since the great majority of the farmers in the sample relied on local varieties,it was not possible to test the effect of improved varieties. It is important to note, however, that fingermillet has received considerable attention among Indian breeders, with 62 improved varieties releasedby the Indian Council for Agricultural Research from 1986 to date.For the calculation of the yield gap, reference yields are required for comparison. Rather thanrelying on data from cropping trials to assess the yield gap, the dependent variable was specifiedAgriculture 2018, 8, 131 4 of 12within the survey data. Yield gap was, therefore, calculated as the difference between actual yieldand maximum yield, with the latter being defined by district as the average of yields found in thehighest decile of the survey sample farm yields. Soil and climatic conditions vary considerably at stateand district levels, but it was out of the scope of this study to estimate potential yields with detailedbio-physical data. Therefore, to account for varying agro-climatic conditions between the locations, wecalculated a district-specific yield gap. Furthermore, we verified that the calculated maximum yieldscorresponded to the agronomic potential of finger millet.The descriptive analysis of the data reveals that the average yield gap is considerable, rangingfrom 37% in Karnataka to 55% in Maharashtra (Table 1). In the latter, average yield was also lowest at1.41 tons per hectare, while mean farm size is largest in Maharashtra at 4.62 hectares. In Karnatakafarms are much smaller, at only 1.33 hectares on average.Table 1.

Econometric Yield Gap EstimationTo identify the determinants of the yield gap in finger millet production a regression analysiswas used. The outcome variable is expressed as a proportion (percent of yield gap). Therefore themaximum possible yield gap is one or 100%, while zero indicates no yield gap. Due to the nature of theoutcome variable and based on Papke and Wooldridge [14], a generalized linear model (GLM) with abinomial family for the error distribution and a logit link for the dependent variable was selected forthe analysis. It was hypothesized that a greater input use is associated with a lower level of yield gap.Other determinants hypothesized to be associated with a reduced yield gap were: age, education andfarm size. By contrast, living below the poverty line and a perceived lack of technical support throughadvisory services were expected to constrain farmers in closing their yield gap. The fit of the modelwas tested, and, based on the log pseudolikelihood of −317.47; the Akaike information criterion (AIC)for the regression was 0.925, indicating a good fit.2.3. Assessment of Total Factor Productivity (TFP)TFP is considered the most informative measure of agricultural productivity. It takes into accountthe land, labour, capital, and material resources employed in farm production, while comparing themwith the total value of crop and livestock output [12]. TFP measures the increase in total output thatAgriculture 2018, 8, 131 5 of 12is not caused by an increase in quantity of inputs used. TFP growth approximates changes in theinput quality, which refers to technological change, and also provides a good estimate of the technicalefficiency [15]. TFP is different from a partial measure of productivity, which only takes account of asingle input in comparison with the level of output.Frontier and non-frontier approaches are the two most common ways of computing TFP andcan be further distinguished in terms of their use of parametric or non-parametric techniques [16,17].The frontier approach e.g., Hossain et al. [18] consists of estimating the frontier of input-outputcombinations. Under this approach, a positive change in TFP is generated by an outward shift ofthe frontier, in other words by better production possibilities either due to technological progressor technical efficiency improvements. Contrary to the frontier approach, the non-frontier approachassumes that companies are technically efficient. In this case, TFP growth is only determined bytechnological progress [19]. The rationale behind this assumption is that, in the long-term, businessestend to find the most efficient combination of inputs-outputs through a continuous learning process.Parametric techniques are based on estimating stochastic frontier models or on estimatingproduction functions, using the time parameter as determinant of the evolving state of technology.The time parameter captures variations in productivity not due to changes in quantities of input use.In contrast, non-parametric techniques are based on linear programming or TFP indices. In particularthe Tornqvist-Theil index is commonly used for growth accounting in the agricultural sector [12,19,20].Given the limited number of observations (15 for each state), the use of parametric methods wasruled out and the Tornqvist-Theil index was used to compute TFP growth. This provides evidenceon technological change in finger millet production and allows inferences to the roles of research,innovation and dissemination efforts.According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) [21],a Tornqvist-Theil index “is a weighted geometric average of the price relatives using arithmeticaverages of the value shares in the two periods as weights”. More specifically, the Tornqvist-Theilindex is of interest to aggregate all inputs into a single variable [22]. This is made possible bysumming up the monetary value of inputs, weighted by their share in the total cultivation cost, furtheradjusted by variations in the quantity used (more details thereafter). The Tornqvist-Theil index partlycontrols for changes in input prices and substitution effects [12], approximating changes in the stateof technology through measuring the weighted differences in the growth rate of outputs and inputsthat are expressed in natural logarithms [22]. The weights used are the share of revenue of the outputand of the cost of inputs in relation to the total revenue and total production cost. Further detailson the Törnqvist-Theil approach can be found, for example, in the work of Capalbo and Vo [22] andCoelli [23]. Using the Tornqvist-Theil index, TFP growth in our study was calculated as follows:TFP growth (%) = ln(QjtQjt− 1)− ln ( QXitXit− 1 ) (1)ln (QjtQjt− 1 ) = 1/2n∑j = 1(PjtQjt∑PjtQjt+Pjt− 1Qjt− 1Pjt− 1Qjt− 1)ln (QjtQjt− 1 ) (2)ln (XitXit− 1 ) = 1/2n∑j = 1(CitXit∑CitXit+Cit− 1Xit− 1Cit− 1Xit− 1)ln (XitXit− 1 ) (3)TFP growth represents the difference between the index of output growth and the index of inputgrowth. The index of output growth equals half of the summed monetary value of each output [price(Pjt) multiplied by quantity (Qjt)] in the years (t) and (t − 1), divided by the total revenue for fingermillet (main grain and by-product), and multiplied by the variation in output (Qjt/Qjt − 1) betweenthe year (t) and (t − 1). The index of input growth equals half of the summed monetary value of eachinput [price (Xit) multiplied by quantity (Cit)] in the year (t) and (t− 1), divided by the total productionAgriculture 2018, 8, 131 6 of 12cost for finger millet, and multiplied by the variation in quantity used (Xit/Xit − 1) between the year(t) and (t − 1).Our analysis covers the period from 1999 to 2014 for the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka,Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, using available time-series output and input data specific to fingermillet production, extracted from the website of the Indian Directorate of Economics and Statistics,Government of India [24]. Inflation rates for India were obtained from the website of the WorldBank [25], and were used to deflate all monetary data (taking the year 1997 as basis).The output and input growth indices were smoothed using the HP (Hodrick-Prescott) filter tohelp control for the important annual fluctuations in the level of output. The smoothed data seriesprovide a better indicator of productivity trends in the long term [26].3. Results3.1. Determinants of Yield GapThe regression results are presented in Table 2. Controlling for location, parameter signs were,with few exceptions, as hypothesized. In the regression output in Table 2 a negative value correspondsto a reduction in the yield gap, whilst a positive value indicates that a change in the variable increasesthe yield gap. While most effects were significant, age, medium education, living below the povertyline, and seed inputs did not have a significant impact on the yield gap. Location dummies forKarnataka, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu all had positive signs (being significant for Karnataka andMaharashtra), indicating an increased yield gap in these states as compared to Andhra Pradesh,the omitted dummy variable, when controlling for all other effects.Table 2.

Lack of technical support on the contrary leads to aAgriculture 2018, 8, 131 7 of 12yield gap that is 8.66 percentage points higher. Larger farm size is associated with a lower yield gap,however the magnitude of the effect is relatively small. The input covariates irrigation, labour andfertiliser use led to the most substantial reductions in the yield gap. With all other variables heldconstant, the use of moderate irrigation (compared to no irrigation), could lower the yield gap by13.14 percentage points, while intensive irrigation use could reduce the gap by 21.97 percentage points.Since labour, fertiliser and other input variables are expressed in logarithmic form, Table 2 reportsmarginal effects as percentage changes for these items. For instance, an additional 10% labour inputwould lower the yield gap by 7.90 percentage points.3.2. TFP GrowthThe yield gap analysis demonstrates that input intensification, higher education and increasedtechnical support are crucial factors at the farm-level. The analysis of TFP growth can improve theunderstanding of productivity issues at a more aggregate level and over time. Figure 1 shows trendsfor the four selected states in output, input and TFP growth for finger millet production between 1999and 2014. A negative trend in TFP growth is apparent in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, while TFPgrowth is highly variable in the other two states. In Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, there appears to begreater variation in output than in input growth. This difference may be due to the fact that the outputgrowth can also be influenced by external factors, such as variations in the level of precipitation.Agriculture 2018, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW  7 of 12  points.

Smoothed input, output and total factor productivity (TFP) growth series for finger millet production between 1999 and 2014. Table 3 indicates that despite annual variation and varying trends, on average TFP growth between 1999 and 2014 was positive for all of the states considered. The state of Tamil Nadu achieved the highest TFP growth during that period (3.61%), whilst the other states had a positive change of around 1.5%. It is interesting to emphasise that the trends in TFP growth were driven by a decrease in the annual input growth in the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, as in both instances annual output growth was also decreasing over time. By contrast, in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, the TFP growth was mainly driven by an increase in output growth. Furthermore, the results show that there is considerable variability between different sub-periods (1999 to 2002; 2003 to 2006; 2007 to 2010; and 2011 to 2014). The results obtained for these sub-periods complement the trend lines in Figure 1, removing some of the variability observed from year to year.   Figure 1.

The results obtained for these sub-periodscomplement the trend lines in Figure 1, removing some of the variability observed from year to year.TFP growth in the state of Tamil Nadu was always positive, despite a very low level in the periodfrom 1999 to 2002. However, for the states of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh there appears to be anegative trend, the average TFP growth for the entire period from 1999 to 2014 was slightly positive.The level of TFP growth of these states was very high from 1999 to 2002 (>7%) before decreasingconstantly. The TFP growth in the sub-period from 2007 to 2010 accounted for less than 1% but waspositive, whereas it declined quite considerably between 2010 and 2014 (−5% to −3%). The resultsobtained for the state of Karnataka show negative growth and are similar to those calculated by Kumarand Mittal [27], who assessed the period from 1986 to 2000. For the state of Tamil Nadu, however,different results emerged. In that state, our calculation indicates a TFP growth of almost 4% from 1999to 2014, while Kumar and Mittal [27] found TFP growth to be negative in the previous period from1986 to 2000. As for the state of Maharashtra, there is no clear tendency even though we observe thatTFP growth has been clearly positive since 2007 (around 8%), reversing a negative earlier trend.Since detailed data on research and extension systems for agriculture in India were not availableat state level or were not specific to finger millet production, the likely determinants of the TFP growthare discussed in the following section.4. DiscussionEnhancing the use of minor millets represents an important proposition to contribute to foodsecurity and dietary diversity [8]. It also represents an opportunity to increase productivity, especiallyin lower-performing areas. Reducing yields gaps in such parts of the world has been estimated toprovide the basic caloric requirements for more than 800 million people [28]. However, the challenges topromoting widespread cultivation of finger millet are immense. The crop needs to be an economicallyviable solution for farmers in order to play a decisive role in contributing to climate resilience, foodsecurity and nutrition.Agriculture 2018, 8, 131 9 of 12Considerations on realising productivity gains in developing countries are often focused onincreasing output through a more intensive use of farm inputs, mainly fertilisers (e.g., [29]). Our resultsshow that it is necessary to address productivity challenges at various levels in order to make fingermillet a more viable choice for farmers in southern India. Labour and fertiliser are crucial factors atthe farm level. However, rather than suggesting a narrow focus on input intensification, the yieldgap analysis indicates that investments in irrigation infrastructure, education and technical supportservices are of great importance. These investments should be enhanced as such aspects are alsokey to achieving consistent TFP growth [12]. The TFP analysis also suggests not only focusing oninput intensification. While not explicit in the analysis, gender issues are an important considerationfor a sustainable productivity growth strategy. Women play a crucial role in cultivation, processing,marketing and consumption of millets. Their involvement in variety development may ensure thatneeds are met in terms of maintaining or enhancing key crop characteristics.The analysis of TFP data from 1999 to 2014 reveals a high variability and opposing trends acrossthe region. While the development of TFP growth for finger millet is negative in Andrah Pradeshand Karnataka, it is positive in the other two states, reaching up to 3.61% on average for TamilNadu. Growth in Tamil Nadu and to a greater extend in Maharashtra has been unsteady, however.The negative trends in Andrah Pradesh and Karnataka and the variability in particular in Maharashtrapoint towards a need for technological and social innovations with regard to finger millet. Based onprevious studies [12,30,31], the comparatively higher performance of Tamil Nadu in terms of TFPgrowth may be explained by factors such as research and development, advisory systems, education,governance and infrastructure. In this case, it may also be due to the fact that the initial productivitylevel was low in Tamil Nadu. In an analysis of productivity growth in major crops in Karnataka statefor the period 1980 to 1995, Ananth [32] found that TFP growth was higher in crops that attractedhigher research investments, such as rice, sugarcane and cotton. Further enquiry is necessary toestablish the exact reasons for the observed trends. However, the lack of data, on agricultural researchand extension expenditures and other possible TFP determinants, impedes a more precise assessmentof what exactly caused the observed TFP growth patterns.Regarding the TFP data itself, it should be noted that the results rely on the assumption thatinputs and outputs were consistently and accurately recorded. In addition, using an index for thecomputation of TFP growth assumes competitive behaviour and constant returns to scale. In thecontext of finger millet production in southern India, this might not always be the case; our data doesnot provide any indications to the contrary, however.Increasing research and development efforts is in line with information from the farm-levelsurvey data. This revealed low levels of adoption of improved finger millet varieties in some states.Even with higher adoption of newer varieties, such as the GPU28 variety in Karnataka, TFP growthis not assured. Therefore, the development of new cultivars alone is insufficient, but research needsto be integrated into an approach that facilitates the adoption of appropriate growing practices anddevelops market opportunities. Results by Fischer et al. [2] confirm this. At the moment, there is anapparent disconnect between research outputs and uptake, which urgently needs to be addressed.Varieties released by research organisations should clearly respond to the demands of farmers in termsof growing requirements, but also in terms of quality and taste, as finger millet is often grown for homeconsumption. Advisory services need to be strengthened in order to support farmers to articulatetheir needs and use appropriate cultivation techniques, such as line sowing and timely and precisefertilising. This can help to reduce labour requirements, achieve better yields and maintain fingermillet as part of relatively diverse rotation, avoiding the trend of specialisation and monocultures.Finger millet provides farmers with a climate-resilient crop that fits well into a mixed farming systeminvolving livestock. Its hardiness and nutritional properties make it a strategic crop for ensuring foodsecurity. Nevertheless, for finger millet production to be maintained or enhanced, increased yieldsmust be achieved by the adoption of new varieties and good practice in agronomic techniques. FurtherAgriculture 2018, 8, 131 10 of 12research is required into approaches that deliver productivity growth and guarantee the nutritionbenefits of finger millet.Finger millet is still consumed as a main foodstuff in large parts of southern India, and efforts areunder way to increase the appeal of finger millet for consumers, also in urban areas. Besides awarenesscampaigns on the dietary benefits, biofortification is seen as a way to boost consumption and achievebetter nutrition outcomes. Ongoing research under the ISCB, using consumer auctions, shows thatthere is an increased willingness to pay for an improved finger millet with higher iron availability.A study by Pallante et al. [11] illustrated the potential for developing niche markets for finger millet.These opportunities, however, depend on how effectively and widespread consumer informationregarding the beneficial nutritional aspects can be communicated and reach specific target groups ofconsumers, for instance those affected by anaemia or young people. The social stigma attached tomillets, considered often as ‘food of the poor’ especially by the younger generation, requires speciallytargeted awareness campaigns; for instance, involving known chefs who fuse traditional crops withmodern cuisine.5. ConclusionsAdditional studies are required on the acceptance of farmers of specific finger millet varietiesand the factors that influence adoption. Achieving sustained productivity gains is only possible ifresearch better responds to the needs expressed by farmers and if the crop is meaningfully embeddedin an overall strategy for sustainable intensification of production and sustainable diets. Only if thevarious economic and social constraints can be sufficiently addressed will it be possible to harness thepotential of underutilised crops, such as finger millet, for climate resilience, food security and nutrition.This study illustrates the need to sustain and intensify investments in infrastructure, includingirrigation, as well as in education, technical support services, and more generally in needs-basedagricultural research and development.Supplementary Materials: The dataset used for the yield gap analysis in this study is available from thecorresponding author on reasonable request.
