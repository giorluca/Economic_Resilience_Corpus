ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
As I look back at my educational journey up to this moment, it is the unconditional love, 
unyielding support, and untiring hard work of my parents and grandparents for which I am most 
thankful.  It is from them that I learnt that compassion, patience, resilience, and tenacity are more 
powerful than anything else in helping one achieve personal goals – an invaluable lesson that has been 
particularly useful during these last five years.  From my brother, I have learnt the importance of quiet 
observation in assessing, analyzing, and solving problems. 
 In addition to my family, I want to acknowledge the crucial support and encouragement that 
some of my close friends have provided during my graduate life.  A big thanks to Deepti for being a 
true friend, and for always inspiring kindness and excellence in whatever I did, since our undergraduate 
days in Pune.  I am immensely grateful to Devki for the countless hours of happiness and fun-filled 
conversations about art, music, and science that we have shared in the last two years – I have learnt so 
much about creativity and expression from her.  Life as a new international student can be tough, but 
thanks to Sachin, the transition from one culture and lifestyle to another was relatively smooth, and I 
always felt that I could count on him in any situation.  Neha, Mark, the Deshmukh family, Taylor, 
Hurf, Vikram, Vikrant, Vineet, Laura, Sam, and friends from the Combustion Lab, Ceramics Club, 
the BLUElab Living Building Challenge team, and Tau Beta Pi – I am so lucky to have had your 
company and friendship.  You have all made my years in Ann Arbor really memorable.

 I am incredibly thankful to my dissertation committee members for their generous support and 
valuable critique of my work.  Mark Daskin’s patient guidance on notations and thorough review of 
the mathematical framework has been instrumental in the successful implementation of the 
optimization model in this thesis.  Neil Dasgupta’s critical questions about the data, model 
assumptions, and policy implications have really helped refine the work in this thesis on carbon 
mitigation in the energy and transportation sectors.  The discussions on allocation in life cycle 
assessment with Ming Xu contributed significantly to the validation of the environmental assessment 
framework discussed in the sections on CO2 recovery.  I am also grateful to Dave Stephenson and 
Andres Clarens for sharing their experimental work that contributed to the papers on supercritical 
CO2-assisted machining.  Thank you to Burak Ozdoganlar and his research group at Carnegie Mellon 
for sharing their experimental setup and data processing techniques, which contributed to the work 
on supercritical CO2-assisted micromachining.  I am very grateful to my EASTlab colleagues Katie 
Whitefoot, Vineet Raichur, Katie Caruso and Sherri Cook for sharing their knowledge and experience 
in their fields of expertise.  I particularly want to thank Katie Caruso for her work on, and help with 
transitioning from the first iteration of the optimization model, and thank Karsten Kieckhäfer from 
TU Braunschweig for providing the data on vehicle value depreciation and battery technology cost 
projections.  
And finally, to Steve Skerlos, for the pivotal role he has played in shaping the work presented in 
this entire thesis, and in my overall professional development over the last five years, all I can say is 
that I cannot thank you enough!  I have learned so much about sustainability, design, and the guiding 
principles for conducting and evaluating sound research from you.  But I believe this knowledge is just 
iv 
 incidental to having worked with you as my academic advisor.  The lessons in servant leadership in 
the context of scholarship and education, and in being a good mentor, are what I value the most 
among all the skills and philosophies that I learnt during my apprenticeship with you.  For all your 
support, and all your kindness, I humbly express my gratitude.

ABSTRACT 
Environmental and Economic Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Recovery and 
Mitigation in the Industrial and Energy Sectors 
by 
Sarang D. Supekar 
Chair: Steven J. Skerlos 
Anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO₂) is a global pollutant that needs urgent control to prevent 
large-scale vitiation of ecosystems.  Generally speaking, anthropogenic CO2 emissions can be reduced 
through (1) CO2 capture for long-term sequestration or use in other applications, (2) renewable and 
low-carbon energy sources and technologies, and (3) demand reduction of carbon-intensive services 
and products through reduced consumption and efficiency improvements.  The first two approaches 
constitute the “supply-side” of carbon abatement measures, and are the focus of this dissertation in 
which I examine the environmental and economic attributes of CO2 recovery and mitigation 
technologies in the U.S. industrial and energy sectors. 
Starting by developing a comprehensive picture of the recovered CO2 supply chain, this 
dissertation provides process-based emissions inventories for recovering and purifying CO2 from 
xv 
 
 combustion flue gases and higher purity point sources for sequestration and use in industrial 
applications.  The strong influence of CO2 quality on the emissions, energy consumption, and costs 
of carbon capture found through this analysis warrants deeper scientific and economic analyses of 
carbon capture and sequestration as a carbon abatement option.  To estimate the marginal emissions 
from use of recovered CO2 in industrial applications, a market-based allocation methodology is 
developed in a consequential life cycle assessment framework, along with new greenhouse gas 
accounting procedures that incorporate reuse and sequestration as fates for CO2.  This methodology 
is presented with results from experimental studies on recovered CO2-based metalworking fluids, and 
motivates further exploration of applications employing the thermal and chemical properties of CO2 
for pollution prevention and carbon abatement. 
The dissertation concludes with an examination of carbon mitigation strategies from the 
standpoint of CO2 prevention in the U.S. electric and automotive sectors.  By creating a stock-and-
flow model of the U.S. automotive and power generation fleets, and considering the evolution of all 
major technologies in both sectors in an optimization framework, cost-minimizing technology 
trajectories are identified, which collectively cut about 55 gigatons of CO2 emissions by 2050.  The 
analysis reveals that despite anticipated advancements and cost reductions in carbon abatement 
technologies with time, the technological costs of carbon abatement are likely to increase markedly 
with delay in climate-action.

CHAPTER 1  
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
 The United States (U.S.) is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs) 
behind China, and the largest emitter when considering population density.  In 2011, the total U.S. 
GHG emission was equivalent to 6700 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (MMT CO2 eq.).  
Serious climate change mitigation efforts within the U.S. over the next two to three decades will thus 
be critical in achieving meaningful short as well as long term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Figure 1.1 illustrates a decomposition of U.S. GHG emissions by economic sector, their sub-sectors, 
and fossil fuel type.  The vast majority of U.S. GHG emissions (over 80%) come from the industrial 
sector, which includes fossil fuel supply chain industries, and the energy sector, which includes 
transportation.  Furthermore, nearly 85% of the total U.S. GHG inventory is comprised of CO2 
emissions, although the impact of the more potent GHGs such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide 
(N2O), and haloalkanes (CFCs, HCFCs, and PFCs) is not negligible.  Thus, from a climate change 
mitigation standpoint, CO2 is not only the most significant GHG of concern, but concurrently also 
the GHG with the largest potential for achieving meaningful reductions in emissions. 
Several technology options exist on the supply side to achieve significant cuts in CO2 emissions 
over the next few decades, in addition to conservation measures on the demand side of the services 
provided by these sectors.  Since a majority of GHG emissions are from combustion of fossil fuels 
1 
 
 (nearly 80% in the U.S.), carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been identified as potentially 
playing a significant role in stabilizing carbon emissions by many of the studies on GHG trajectory 
projections (IPCC, 2005; Pacala & Socolow, 2004; Stern, 2008; Williams et al., 2012).  Captured 
CO2 can be “stored” through geological, ocean, or mineral sequestration .  It can also be used as a 
feedstock or solvent in niche industrial applications such as food and beverage manufacturing 
(Raventos, Duarte, & Alarcon, 2002), pharmaceutical manufacturing (Subramaniam, Rajewski, & 
Snavely, 1997), pH control, welding and solvent extraction (Aresta & Dibenedetto, 2007; DeSimone, 
2002).

 The capture of CO2 is an energy intensive process that has its own carbon footprint among other 
environmental impacts.  As in the case of biofuels (Clarens, Resurreccion, White, & Colosi, 2010), it 
is thus important to account for the energy and material inflows and outflows for CCS systems to 
evaluate the net reduction in CO2.  Several studies in the literature (Khoo & Tan, 2006; Koornneef, 
van Keulen, Faaij, & Turkenburg, 2008; Singh, Strømman, & Hertwich, 2011) have examined the 
life cycle environmental impacts of CCS from coal and natural gas power plants.  These studies 
estimate that every metric ton of CO2 captured leads to 200-350 kg of emissions on-site or from 
upstream processes depending on the fuel source, and separation method.  The energy penalties 
assumed in these studies however only take into the basic steps of separation, compression, and 
refrigeration involved in CO2 capture.  They do not account for the steps that may be required to 
purify the CO2 to a level that is safe (from an environmental and occupational standpoint) for 
transportation, as well as sequestration or use as an industrial feedstock.  Thus, they do not account 
for the influence of the quality of CO2 on the net energy balance and carbon footprint (Zapp et al., 
2012), which may lead to underestimation of CCS impacts. 
Furthermore, current greenhouse gas accounting guidelines lack a clear formulation of accounting 
strategies for either sequestered CO2 (IPCC, 2005) or for CO2 that is used as a feedstock or solvent in 
industrial applications.  For instance, guidelines from the World Resources Institute (WRI)  classify 
the direct and indirect emissions from an organization into three operational boundaries.  Under this 
classification, Scope 1 emissions are the direct on-site emissions, Scope 2 emissions are those caused 
by electricity use, and finally Scope 3 accounts for emissions that occur upstream or downstream of 
the organization due to its activities.  The key problem leading to concerns about proper accounting 
 3 
 in case of sequestration or reuse of recovered CO2 is that Scope 1 does not distinguish between 
generation of greenhouse gases and their emission into the atmosphere.  In the case of sequestration, 
this can lead to overestimation or underestimation of GHG inventories for instance, in cases where 
the CO2 is removed from a fuel prior to combustion using gasification in one place, but is combusted 
for energy in another.  In the case of reuse, the lack of distinction between generation and emission 
can lead to the CO2 generated from a power plant to be counted towards the Scope 1 emissions of the 
recovered CO2 end-user.  In the event of some sort of a carbon penalty being levied in the future, the 
current accounting system will thus impose a penalty for reusing CO2 before emitting it to the 
atmosphere, even if this reuse offsets large amounts of other Scope 3 emissions that are usually 
unmeasured and unreported.   
For instance, the well known environmental and human health hazards associated with the use of 
conventional organic solvents and refrigerants have motivated the development of alternate CO2-based 
technologies sans these hazards. CO2 acts as a non-flammable and non-corrosive substitute due to its 
favorable chemical and physical properties.  CO2 has found application as a feedstock, chilling agent, 
or solvent in several industrial applications such as food and beverage manufacturing (Raventos et al., 
2002), pharmaceutical manufacturing (Subramaniam et al., 1997), pH control, welding and solvent 
extraction (Aresta & Dibenedetto, 2007; Beckman, 2004).  Most of the CO2 used in the merchant 
market is recovered as a byproduct in ammonia, hydrogen, ethylene oxide, titanium dioxide and 
ethanol plants, and in rare instances from flue gases resulting from fossil fuel combustion. 
 4 
 One of the main barriers to adoption of recovered CO2 in pollution prevention and sustainable 
manufacturing applications is the legitimate concern of industries to reduce their ‘carbon footprints’ 
which runs counter to the benefits of using CO2.  This concern emanates from two main factors: 1) 
the focus of current greenhouse gas accounting practice being on the point-of-release of GHG 
emissions rather than point-of-generation, and 2) the inability of the traditional (attributional) life 
cycle assessment methods to allocate causal emissions to a co-product or byproduct in a multiple 
output process.  A market-based allocation and GHG accounting approach is thus needed to develop 
a more thorough understanding of the environmental impacts of recovered CO2 for sequestration or 
reuse.  This serves as the first motivation for the dissertation.  As such, the first part of this dissertation 
aims to bridge this gap by using a process-based consequential life cycle assessment approach to (1) 
evaluate the impacts of CO2 recovery and processing for sequestration and reuse, (2) develop a 
complementary GHG accounting methodology, and (3) evaluate the marginal environmental impacts 
of using recovered CO2 in manufacturing applications to substitute current emission intensive 
products/processes. 
For CO2 sources where CCS could either be technologically or economically infeasible several 
other technology options have been identified in the literature.  For instance, studies on the 
transportation sector (Bandivadekar et al., 2008; Grimes-Casey, Keoleian, & Willcox, 2009; 
McCollum & Yang, 2009; Rentziou, Gkritza, & Souleyrette, 2012) analyze the relative potentials of 
various powertrain technologies, fuels, and demand reduction strategies in reducing greenhouse gas 
emissions.  Other studies focus on analyzing specific technologies such as plugin hybrids (Shiau et al., 
2010), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (Greene, Leiby, & Bowman, 2007), and biofuels (Kromer, 
 5 
 Bandivadekar, & Evans, 2010), demand reduction measures (Cervero & Duncan, 2006), or policy 
measures such as CAFE (Whitefoot & Skerlos, 2012) or carbon taxes (Morrow et al. 2010). Although 
each study focuses on selected strategies, and uses different scenarios for future demand and technology 
costs/emissions within those strategies, their common message is that the most effective approach to 
achieving deep cuts in GHG emissions is a combination of different strategies.  Similarly, studies on 
GHG mitigation in the electric utility sector (Pacala & Socolow, 2004; Turton & Barreto, 2006; van 
Vuuren et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2012) have examined the role of various technologies and 
strategies such as renewables, biomass-derived fuels, nuclear, and natural gas using both top-down 
models (macroeconomic- or econometrics-based) and bottom up (technology- or engineering-based) 
models. These studies emphasize the importance of using a combination of strategies to achieve deep 
cuts in GHG emissions, and establish the value of both macroeconomic and technology-based models 
in designing effective climate change policies. 
Studies in the literature that are based on macroeconomic models use some form of profit 
maximizing objective function to generate economic, technological and emission outcomes. Most of 
the bottom-up model-based studies on the other hand are simulation-based.  While simulation-based 
models are valuable in understanding the range of possible technology and emission trajectories, they 
predict emission trajectories based on a spectrum of “what if” scenarios with projections for factors 
such as economic growth, demand growth, technology progression, fuel prices, fuel economy 
standards, and taxes or penalties.  Although such analyses provide valuable insights for policy makers 
as to what could happen under the “what if” scenarios assessed, they may not provide adequate 
information on what should happen from the point of view of minimizing total societal cost. In this 
 6 
 regard, an optimization-based approach in bottom-up models is equally important for a concerted 
analysis with profit-maximizing macroeconomic models for developing effective policies.  Such a 
model, together with a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of parameters such as fuel prices, which are 
known to cause variability in the outcomes of simulation-based models, can also predict a narrower 
and more confident range of technology and emission trajectories.  This is an important requirement 
for informing public policy, and the lack of optimization-based bottom-up models in energy and 
transportation climate change policy analysis studies constitutes a critical gap in the published 
literature.  This gap serves the second motivation for this dissertation. 
The second part of the dissertation thus aims to start filling this gap in the literature by developing 
a bottom-up cost minimization framework.  The model that implements the framework allows us to 
determine the techno-economic emission reduction potential of various currently available 
technologies, and predict emission trajectories in the auto and electricity sectors.  The model considers 
lifetime use-phase costs borne by producers, consumers, and government over the analysis time 
horizon. To estimate GHG abatement costs and compare technology trajectories under emission 
regulated scenarios in both sectors, the model uses a reference business-as-usual case without emission 
regulations.  The business-as-usual case is also assumed to operate under a cost-minimization 
framework.

CHAPTER 2  
CARBON DIOXIDE RECOVERY 
2.1 CO2 SUPPLY CHAIN AND RECOVERY PROCESS 
Figure 1.1 shows that fossil fuel combustion from various sectors and sub-sectors accounts for 94% 
of the total CO2 emissions in the U.S, of which roughly 32% is from fossil fuel-based thermal power 
plants.  To mitigate this large volume of combustion-related CO2 emissions, technologies for various 
carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) options such as pre-combustion, oxy-fuel, and post-
combustion capture have been explored, and their technological potential has been well established 
(IPCC, 2005).  Four pilot CCS projects (< 30 MW) have been in operation in the U.S. since 2005, 
and five full-scale projects are either in the construction or planning phase (MIT CC&ST Program, 
2014).  Since post-combustion capture remains the “most common and commercially mature” 
technology option according to a recent study on the prospects of CCS technologies (Eide, 2013), it 
is studied in detail in this dissertation.  In addition to CO2 capture from fossil fuel combustion, there 
are opportunities for CO2 recovery from industrial processes that generate CO2 as a byproduct of 
chemical or biological processes.  Examples of such processes are iron and steel production, cement 
production, ammonia production, and ethanol production, and together these non-combustion CO2 
sources in the industrial sector account for roughly 3.5% of the total U.S. CO2 emissions.  
8 
 
 The recovered CO2 supply chain begins with a source of CO2, which could either be an 
anthropogenic point source or a natural reservoir of CO2.  Nearly three quarters of the U.S. merchant 
market CO2 capacity of 14.3 million metric tons (MMT) per year (Advanced Cryogenics, 2013) 
comprises of ammonia, ethanol, and hydrogen plants in which the CO2 is produced as a co-product 
of chemical processes (hereafter referred to as co-product sources).  A fifth of the total capacity comes 
from natural CO2 wells, and the remaining is comprised of natural gas processing plants, post-
combustion capture plants, and ethylene oxide and titanium dioxide manufacturing plants. 
 
Figure 2.1. Recovered CO2 merchant and captive markets in the U.S. broken down 
by source and end-use application. 
  
 9 
 It should be noted that this merchant market CO2 capacity is in addition to the nearly 44 MMT 
CO2 capacity (Meyer, 2007) used for captive market applications such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR), 
for which there exists a dedicated supply network largely of natural wells in parts of the Rocky 
Mountain, Appalachian, and Southwest regions of the U.S.  Merchant markets are distinguished from 
captive markets, where the suppliers and buyers of a commodity are usually owned by the same entity 
and/or serve a niche industry in which the commodity is used in bulk. The recovered CO2 supply and 
demand in the U.S. including merchant and captive sources is summarized in Figure 2.1. 
The purity of the raw CO2 feed stream from ammonia, ethanol, and hydrogen plants, is over 97% 
(v/v), while the purity of raw CO2 from natural wells is between 80 - 98% (v/v) (Feinberg & Karpuk, 
1990).  Irrespective of the source, raw CO2 streams contain various amounts of alcohols, water, alkanes, 
aldehydes, ketones, air gases, carbon monoxide, sulfides, mercaptans, and volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) such as toluene, xylene, and benzene (European Industrial Gases Association, 2008)  
Impurities such as mercury, amines, and nitrogen oxides may also be present depending on the CO2 
source.  Most merchant market CO2 is purified to meet food grade quality of 99.9% (v/v) or higher, 
with a few plants producing 99.5% (v/v) pure industrial grade CO2.  
Recovery of CO2 from combustion sources begins with separating the CO2 from a mixture of 
other gases such as nitrogen and its oxides, sulfur compounds, oxygen, and water vapor present in the 
combustion flue gas.  The separation process, which is akin to enrichment of CO2 from the waste 
stream for further processing, nearly eliminates all dissolved gases leaving behind trace impurities. 
Separation is mainly carried out using a chemical absorption/stripping processes, although other 
 10 
 techniques such as membrane or cryogenic separation that can be used depending on the CO2 partial 
pressure are also being explored.  An aqueous solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) is most 
ubiquitously used solvent for absorption of CO2, but other solvents such as methyl-diethanolamine 
(MDEA), potassium carbonate, and chilled ammonia are also used in certain plants (Kothandaraman, 
2010).  The key processes following separation are high-pressure compression to about 100 bar, 
cooling, scrubbing (if SO2 content is more than 10 ppmv), drying, activated carbon treatment, and 
distillation if removal of non-condensable air gases such as oxygen is necessary for downstream 
conditions. These processes prepare the CO2 for pipeline transportation to a geological storage facility 
without causing two-phase flow conditions in the pipelines, or environmental problems during or after 
storage.  The purity of CO2 obtained from these processes meets the industrial grade standard (≥ 
99.5% v/v) set by EIGA (European Industrial Gases Association, 2008). 
During the production of ammonia, hydrogen and CO2 are produced as a result of natural gas 
steam reforming and water gas shift reactions.  To facilitate the reaction between this hydrogen and 
nitrogen, an amine absorption-stripping process is used to remove the CO2 from the gas stream.  This 
CO2 then serves as the raw feed gas for further processing.  Similarly, in the refinery hydrogen 
production process, CO2 is separated from hydrogen usually using pressure swing adsorption.  The 
CO2 stream, which still contains significant quantities of hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide, 
is reacted with oxygen in a furnace.  After the heat from this exothermic reaction recovered, the CO2 
stream acts as the raw feed gas for further processing.  In an ethanol production facility, the CO2 off-
gas released during the biomass fermentation process serves as the feed gas for further processing. 
 11 
 The purification train (and associated process conditions) used for recovery of CO2 from both 
ethanol and ammonia production is identical due to the similar composition, temperature, and 
pressure conditions of the raw byproduct CO2 feed gas, and follows the steps listed above for recovery 
and purification of CO2 from post-combustion sources.  The two significant differences here are that 
if the CO2 is to be sold in the merchant market, it is only necessary to compress it to a pressure of 
about 21 bar, and since CO2 is not in the supercritical state these conditions, a refrigeration step at 
the end of the purification process is required to facilitate easier and cheaper storage and transport of 
the CO2.  Recovery of CO2 from hydrogen plants requires an additional catalytic oxidation step before 
purification with activated carbon since the upstream process of steam reforming of natural gas 
introduces a higher concentration of hydrocarbon and sulfur compounds than in CO2 from 
fermentation.  In the case of ammonia production, which also involves steam reforming of natural gas, 
the hydrocarbon and sulfur impurities are removed to a greater extent in the amine absorption process 
used to separate ammonia from CO2 than the pressure swing adsorption process used to separate 
hydrogen from CO2 (Yu, Huang, & Tan, 2012).  A catalytic oxidation step is thus generally not 
required to recover industrial or high purity grade CO2 from ammonia.  It should be noted that CO2 
recovery plants are usually owned and operated by an independent firm that buys the raw CO2 feed 
gas from the CO2 producer.  The firm designs the CO2 purification and handling system for the purity 
grade that they wish to sell, which also governs the operating conditions and controls to which the 
various processes are calibrated.  Operating the plant to obtain a different purity grade than what it is 
designed for can thus result in destabilization of the process and production losses.  
 12 
 The processes and operating conditions used to characterize the inputs and environmental 
emissions from the production of industrial and high purity grade CO2 recovered were developed 
based on existing studies in the literature (Finley, 2006; Häring, 2008; Kohl & Nielson, 1997; 
Overcash, Li, Griffing, & Rice, 2007) and inputs from gas industry professionals and companies 
(Rushing, 2013; The Wittemann Company, 2012). Figure 2.1 through Figure 2.5 present the block 
flow diagrams for recovery and purification of CO2 from all the major sources of CO2.  Appendix A 
provides a detailed summary of these steps and process conditions, and data sources used to 
characterize the process.

Upstream emissions for bituminous coal and natural gas were obtained from the U.S. LCI database 
(National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2012), and those for compressed air, oxygen gas, and 
desiccant were obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Ecoinvent Database v2.2, 2010).  Emission 
factors for combustion of coal and natural gas were obtained from U.S. EPA’s Stationary Combustion 
Emissions Report (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1998a, 1998b).  Degradation products of 
MEA and their respective concentrations in the vent gas of the stripper were adapted from Veltman, 
Singh, & Hertwich (2010) to match the heat rate adjustments in this analysis. Efficiencies of baghouse, 
 16 
 FGD, low-NOx, and scrubber units, and activated carbon bed for VOC and heavy metal removal 
were obtained from various sources in the literature (Karnib, Kabbani, Holail, & Olama, 2014; U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, 1998a; U.S. EPA, 2003a, 2003b). Production emissions of 
coconut shell GAC were developed using the process details outlined in Hung (2012).  Infrastructure-
related emissions such as those occurring from building of the recovery plant were excluded from the 
analysis.  Useful heat recovered and fugitive emissions from processes within the CO2 recovery plant 
were estimated using the guidelines provided by Jiménez-González, Kim, & Overcash (2000).  Electric 
energy recovery in a CO2 plant by expanding the pressurized process fluid or combustion gases in a 
gas turbine, wherever practical, was assumed to occur at a mechanical to electrical energy conversion 
efficiency of 40%.  Consumption of materials such as activated carbon (Finley, 2006), desiccant 
(Finley, 2006), and scrubber sump water (Jiménez-González et al., 2000) which are replenished at 
frequencies roughly independent of CO2 production rate, were estimated per unit of CO2 assuming a 
recovery plant capacity of 300 metric tons CO2/day. 
2.2 PRODUCTION IMPACTS OF CO2 RECOVERED FROM COMBUSTION SOURCES  
Using the process details and operating conditions established for recovery of CO2 from post-
combustion sources, the production emissions inventory was developed for capture of CO2 from a 
pulverized bituminous coal power plant (PC) and a natural gas combined cycle power plant (NGCC).  
Heat rates for both fuel sources were obtained from U.S. Energy Information Administration (2013b), 
and include parasitic energy consumption from pre-treatment processes such as flue gas desulfurization 
(FGD) and baghouse (for particulates removal).  These pre-treatment steps are required, specifically 
for CO2 capture from coal-fired plants since high concentration of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, together 
 17 
 with other acid gases such can lead to equipment corrosion and high rates of consumption of the 
chemical absorbent MEA.  CO2 capture from natural gas plants does not require such extensive pre-
treatment due to insignificant concentrations of sulfur and particulate impurities in its flue gas.  They 
however do require low-NOx burners, and the assumed heat rate for natural gas plants accounts for 
this.  It should be noted that several coal and natural gas units across the U.S. already have such units 
installed to be in compliance with local and federal criteria pollutant control regulations, and thus the 
parasitic load form pre-treatment of flue gases is not ascribed to the recovered CO2 in such cases. 
Emission inventories were characterized using the U.S. EPA’s TRACI 2.0 method (Bare, 2011).  
Impact categories chosen for analysis were global warming (GWP), ozone depletion potential 
(OZDP), smog formation (SMOG), acidification (ACIDP), eutrophication potential (EUTP), 
respiratory effects (RESP), energy use (ENER), and water use (WATER).  Characterization factors for 
each pollutant examined were obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Ecoinvent Database v2.2, 2010).  
The emissions inventory includes upstream as well as on-site emissions. 
The upstream, on-site, and total environmental emissions from the production of 1 MWh of 
electricity for sale from PC, PC-CCS, NGCC, and NGCC-CCS are shown in Appendix C, and Figure 
2.6 shows the relative impacts from production of 1 MWh of electricity for sale from PC-CCS (top) 
and NGCC-CCS (bottom) plants relative to their non-CCS counterparts.  PC-CCS and NGCC-CCS 
show a net reduction of about 48% and 61% respectively when considering upstream and on-site 
emissions in the nominal case examined (85% chemical absorption capture efficiency, raw gas purity 
post-MEA treatment 99%, solvent regeneration energy = 4850kJ/kg CO2).  These values are at least 
 18 
 25% lower than values reported in the literature on LCA of CCS plants.  Energy penalty, defined as 
the additional amount of heat input required for maintaining the same level of electricity output from 
the power plant, is found to be about 32% for NGCC plants, which is closer to values reported in 
some studies (Kothandaraman, 2010), but the 124% energy penalty for coal plants is significantly 
higher than any values reported in the literature.   
 
Figure 2.6. Comparison of environmental impacts from 1 MWh of electricity 
generation for sale in PC and NGCC plants with and without capture (CCS) units. 
The life cycle analysis here assumes that the heat source for the recovery plant is coal instead of 
natural gas, which reduces the overall efficiency of the PC-CCS plant more than an NGCC-CCS plant 
 19 
 since the heating value of coal is lower, and its carbon content per unit of heat output is higher than 
natural gas.  As such, energy penalty of a PC-CCS plant can be reduced by using a separate natural gas 
boiler for steam generation and heating in the capture plant, although this will change the mass-balance 
equation of the capture process from its form used for this analysis.  Although the process conditions 
used for the LCA here are for producing industrial grade CO2 (≥ 99.5 % v/v purity), the MEA 
absorption/striping process contributes to more than 90% of the total energy use in the capture plant 
per kg of CO2 captured, and thus the results for ≥ 95.5 % v/v purity as recommended in the 
DYNAMIS CO2 quality guidelines for CCS (de Visser et al., 2008) are not expected to be significantly 
different. 
A potential benefit often associated with of post-combustion CCS plants is the added removal of 
particulate matter, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides emitted to the atmosphere during the various 
recovery and purification steps in the capture plant.  The resulting reduction in concentrations of these 
pollutants can reduce smog formation, eutrophication, and harmful respiratory effects.  However, our 
life cycle analysis shows that apart from the noticeable reduction in particulates and respiratory effects 
likely in NGCC-CCS plants, the overall reduction of the remaining pollutants when considering both 
upstream and on-site emissions are marginal, or in fact negative, meaning the emissions of these 
pollutants actually increase due to the CCS process.  Increase in SMOG is primarily due to the fugitive 
emissions of MEA and its degradation products, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, which are all strong 
smog forming chemicals.  Further, fuel supply chains of both coal and natural gas have high 
eutrophication and ecotoxicity impacts, and thus the significant increase in fuel consumption 
 20 
 overshadows any marginal on-site reduction in the emission of pollutants contributing to these impact 
categories. 
Thus from a life cycle point of view, NGCC-CCS plants can potentially be a more viable carbon 
abatement option than PC-CCS, unless advanced combustion technologies such as gasified coal and 
oxy-fuel combustion, or advanced CO2 separation techniques such as membrane separation are able 
to reduce the energy penalty of coal-fired CCS plants significantly.  Despite differences in the 
magnitude of CO2 reduction and energy penalties for PC-CCS and NGCC-CCS, this overall 
conclusion of the analysis agrees with the recommendations provided in other CCS LCA studies in 
the literature (Khoo & Tan, 2006; Singh et al., 2011) over the highly uncertain techno-economic 
feasibility of coal-fired CCS plants. 
2.3 RECOVERED CO2 IN INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS 
Carbon dioxide is used as a feedstock, chilling agent, and solvent in industrial applications such as 
food and beverage manufacturing (Raventos et al., 2002) pharmaceutical manufacturing 
(Subramaniam et al., 1997) polymer and chemical synthesis (Desimone & Tumas, 2003) pH control, 
welding, solvent extraction (Aresta & Dibenedetto, 2007) and heat pumps (Volkswagen AG, 2013). 
These applications are a part of the roughly 11 million metric ton (MMT) CO2 merchant market in 
the U.S. (Garvey, 2014)  where suppliers (merchants) sell their CO2 on the free market to buyers. 
Merchant markets are distinguished from captive markets, where the suppliers and buyers of a 
commodity are usually owned by the same entity and/or serve a niche industry in which the 
commodity is used in bulk. 
 21 
 Emerging technologies that are based on merchant market CO2 have been reported to significantly 
reduce toxicity, energy consumption, and water consumption in numerous industrial applications, 
receiving over a dozen green chemistry awards in the last two decades (“Green Chemistry Award 2014 
Winner,” 2014, Kenneth G. Hancock Memorial Award, 1999; U.S. EPA, 2014). Such applications, 
while presently small in volume, can potentially be another way of directly reducing CO2 emissions 
by “fixing” the CO2 to other non-greenhouse gas products, or by using the CO2 in CO2-based 
technologies to substitute energy and carbon intensive processes and thereby offsetting those emissions.   
In the United States and other industrialized countries, the merchant market CO2 used in such 
industrial applications is recovered as a co-product from the production of ammonia, hydrogen, 
ethanol, ethylene oxide, and titanium dioxide, as well as from natural gas processing plants, natural 
CO2 wells, and in rare instances from the flue gases of fossil fuel combustion.  A notable barrier to 
achieving higher adoption rates of CO2-based technologies is a concern companies have in regards to 
increasing their ‘carbon footprint’ by embracing these technologies.   This concern emanates from two 
main factors: 1) the focus of current greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting practice on the point-of-release 
of GHG emissions rather than point-of-generation, and 2) the inability of attributional life cycle 
assessment (LCA) methods to allocate causal emissions to a co-product in multiple output processes 
such as those used to produce CO2. 
2.3.1 Greenhouse Gas Accounting Practices 
The World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development 
(WBCSD) provide guidance and a comprehensive standard for businesses and organizations regarding 
how to measure, classify, and report GHG emissions (Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and 
 22 
 Reporting Standard, 2012, Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2011, The Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2004).  Since its creation in 2001, the 
WRI GHG protocol has served as a polestar for corporations and countries who have adopted a 
systematic GHG accounting system (“Looking Back on 15 Years of Greenhouse Gas Accounting,” 
2014).  Companies define their organizational boundary by using an ‘equity’ or ‘control’ based 
approach.  There are operational boundaries within these organizational boundaries, which divide 
emissions into three ‘Scopes.’  Scope 1 accounts for GHG releases that occur from operations owned 
or controlled by the company.  Scope 2 accounts for emissions arising from the generation of electricity 
that is purchased by the company and its entities.  Scope 3 encompasses indirect emissions outside 
Scope1 and Scope 2 (e.g., upstream production processes associated with materials procured by a 
company). 
The guidelines from WRI regarding operational boundaries clearly distinguish between direct 
(Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions from an organization.  However, as identified by 
WRI itself (The Greenhouse Gas Protocol - A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, 2004) there 
is yet to be a clear consensus on an appropriate set of accounting guidelines on reuse and sequestration.  
Recent studies in the literature advance this discussion by focusing on certain aspects of GHG 
accounting for reuse and sequestration such as defining baseline scenarios (Federal Greenhouse Gas 
Accounting and Reporting Guidance, 2010; McCormick, 2012) and ascertaining the allocation along a 
product or commodity value chain (Brandão et al., 2012; McCoy, Pollak, & Jaramillo, 2011). 
However, we believe that accounting for emissions from reuse and sequestration would be 
fundamentally easier to address if the accounting standard distinguished between the generation of 
 23 
 GHGs and the emission of GHGs into the atmosphere.  Since current protocols do not make this 
distinction, the CO2 generated by an ammonia manufacturer will, for instance, be reported under its 
Scope 3 indirect emissions, while being counted towards the Scope 1 emissions of the end-user of this 
CO2 such as a CO2-based decaffeination plant.  This reduces Scope 1 emissions of the CO2 generating 
plant, potentially encouraging more generation of CO2 from it.  It may alternatively reduce incentives 
to purchase recovered CO2 if, for instance, a carbon penalty is levied on companies based on their 
Scope 1 emissions, even if this reuse offsets large amounts of other unreported Scope 3 emissions (via 
process substitution). Classifying the emission of recovered CO2 as a Scope 1 emission for the end-
user firms might also create an incentive for those firms to recover their own CO2 emissions that are 
likely to be dilute and/or highly contaminated with impurities, leading to high costs.  Such forces may 
create disincentives for firms to adopt CO2-based technologies in emerging sustainability applications, 
as suggested by Vogtländer, Brezet, & Hendriks (2001) who note that placing penalties on recovered 
materials by treating firms that eventually scrap the material as creators of the scrap ultimately reduces 
the incentive for using recovered materials. 
2.3.2 Limitations of Allocation Practices in Life Cycle Assessment 
CO2 sold in the merchant market for various applications is largely recovered as a co-product of 
chemical processing plants that produce chemical commodities such as fertilizer and hydrogen as their 
primary product.  In LCA pra
