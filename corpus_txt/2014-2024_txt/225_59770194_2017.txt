Abstract. This paper develops a short-run economic damage assessment 
model. The model contains two sub models. One is the conventional traffic 
assignment model, which calculates traveling time under the damaged 
transportation infrastructure. The other is the economic damage assessment 
model, which determines the decrease in production level in the short run. 
This method facilitates the identification of critical infrastructure that could 
reduce the economic damage when the disaster occurs. As a case study, we 
applied this model to several recovery plans for transport facilities. The 
results suggest that the proposed comprehensive model should be 
considered as a prevention plan. 
1 Introduction  
There is a 70% possibility that a huge earthquake will hit the Nankai trough in Japan in the 
next 30 years. Thus, the economic damage assessment of earthquakes is required for 
effective recovery.  
When the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred, there were several types of economic 
damage: first, “the middle/long-run damage,” which is the damage to production facilities 
or customers; second, “the short-run damage,” which is the shortage of labor or 
intermediate supply by the damage of transportation infrastructure. [1] Since the response 
just after the disaster influences the economic recovery both temporally and spatially, it 
might be important to be focused on the short-run damage. In addition, there is a possibility 
that the spatially uniform policy does not work well in some regions. To sum up, it is 
assumed that the comprehensive policy, considering the damage factor in each region, 
should be planned for the effective recovery. 
There are many previous studies on the economic damage assessment (e.g., Koike et al. 
(2014), Tsuchiya et al. (2006) [2, 3]). However, they are focused on the middle/long-run 
effects, while there no studies on the analysis of the short-run effect.  
This paper proposes an economic damage assessment model in the short-run. 
Additionally, the model is applied to the Chukyo metropolitan area, which is predicted to 
be the most seriously damaged by the Nankai Trough Earthquake. We analyze the

economic damage and specify the main factors of damage in each industry of every region. 
In addition, we simulate two recovery policies on transportation facilities to develop the 
effective recovery policy. 
2 Structure of the economic damage assessment model in the 
.short-run 
2.1 Outline of the model 
Fig. 1 shows the whole structure of the economic damage assessment model in the short -
run. This model contains two sub models, namely the transportation model to calculate 
traveling time and the economic damage assessment model to determine the decrease in 
products in the short-run. This model can analyze the factors that affect economic damage 
the most in each industry in every zone. If the earthquake damages the road or railway 
network, traveling time increases and it causes the limitation of labor supply, intermediate 
supply, or production supply. Finally, the decrease in production is determined by the 
production function with a Leontief technology.

In the transportation model, traveling time is calculated by analyzing the traffic assignment 
using the origin-destination (OD) table and network data. We applied the incremental

assignment method to the road network. Whereas the all-or-nothing method is applied to 
the railway network on the ground to ensure there is no congestion. 
Generally, the traffic assignment analysis applies the four-step method. However, in this 
paper, the traffic assignment model is used on the assumption that the trip generation, 
destination, and modal split are not changed in the short-run. In addition, we apply the 
incremental assignment to the road network to reduce the calculation load. 
2.3 Economic damage assessment model 
2.3.1 Production function 
The production amount at zone j of industry n is determined by the following: yn_Lj means 
the production amount under constraint wherein only the labor cannot commute and the 
intermediate or production goods are supplied as usual. This equation shows that the 
production amount is determined as that under the most seriously damaged factor.

where dnj: production amount; yn_Lj, yn_xj, yn_fj: production amount under damage factor

The production amounts under the damage factor constraint are described as follows. In 
this paper, the production functions (Equation (1), (2), and (3)) are all specified with the 
Leontief technology since it is assumed that production factors in the short-run are not 
substituted.

2.3.2 Limitation of labor/intermediate/production supply 
In this paper, we assume that the increase of traveling time influences the working time or 
decision making of freight transportation. The reduction rate of labor supply sjL is defined 
as Equation (5) and the amount of labor supply is calculated by Equation (6). Next, we set 
the working time as 8 hours per day per worker and it is reduced by the increase in 
traveling time.

Moreover, the limitations of freight transportation are determined depending on the 
increase in the rate of traveling time. It is assumed that the firms decide to stop transport if 
it takes more than 1.5 times the usual traveling time. The reduction of transported 
intermediate goods is Iijm’ and the reduction rate of intermediate supply is calculated by 
Equation (7). Finally, the amount of intermediate supply under damaged by transportation 
is determined by Equation (9). Additionally, it is the same for production supply.

2.4 Data and data sources 
The model requires the following dataset shown in Table 1. In the transportation model, the 
required network data and velocity data is obtained from the Road Traffic Census. In 
addition, the OD matrix of commuting and freight transportation is developed by using the 
Chukyo PT Survey and Chukyo Logistics Survey data. In the economic damage assessment 
model, a dataset is required to develop the GDP data in each industry in every region. If 
there are some regions where GDP data is not available, it could be estimated based on the 
number of workers in that region. The input coefficients of labor and intermediate goods 
are derived from the Input-Output table.

3 Case study  
3.1 Details on assumptions and scenario setting 
3.1.1 Coverage area and transport infrastructure 
The coverage area is Chukyo metropolitan area (Aichi Prefecture, the northern part of Mie 
prefecture and the southern part of Gifu prefecture), which is divided into 111 zones. Fig. 3 
and Fig. 4 show the transport infrastructure in the coverage area. We have excluded the 
local streets and the Shinkansen line.

3.1.2 Setting the scenario 
We applied the model to evaluate the damage of transport infrastructure in the Chukyo 
metropolitan area. We set the scenario wherein the road network and railway network 
cannot be used in a flood-assumed area. Fig. 5 shows that the traveling time increases 
considerably between the regions across the Kiso, Nagara and Ibo rivers.

3.2 Outcomes of scenario 
3.2.1 Economic damage of earthquake by region and industry 
The total financial damage is calculated to be approximately 10 trillion yen/year, which 
constitutes 25% of GDP in the Chukyo metropolitan area.  
From an industry perspective, the manufacturing, wholesale/retail and service industries 
are seriously damaged. The study focuses on the manufacturing industry because the 
purpose of this study is to analyze which factor, caused by preventing commuting or 
physical distribution, has the most significant effect on economic damage. Fig. 7 shows that 
the transport equipment industry is most seriously damaged from the manufacturing 
industry as there are several major car related companies (e.g., TOYOTA).

3.2.2 Main damage factor by region (the transportation equipment industry) 
Fig. 8 shows which factor has the most significant effect on economic damage by zone. Red 
signifies the limited supply of labor, blue signifies the limited intermediate supply, and 
green signifies the limited production supply. 
In the coastal areas, the limited intermediate or production supply is the main damage 
factor. However, in the interior area, the limited labor supply is the main damage factor. 
Fig. 7 shows that the traveling time increases greatly in the coastal area and an unfavorable 
route around the rivers needs to be taken. Thus, it is assumed that intermediate or 
production goods are limited.

3.2.3 Effects of recovery plan for transport facilities 
We simulate two cases of transportation recovery policies in order to evaluate the effect of 
the economic damage reduction by the policy and propose an efficient policy. 
Table 2 shows the economic damage after implementing the two transportation recovery 
policies. Across the whole industry, the effect of the economic damage reduction by policy 
1 is about 1.1 trillion yen/year; in contrast, that of policy 2 is about 6.6 trillion yen/year. In 
the transport equipment industry, the effect on the recovery of the road network is much 
more effective than that of the railway network. This could be because railway network is 
only used for commuting, but road network has a multi-use (for commuting and freight 
transportation).

Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the damage factors after the recovery of the railway 
network. On comparing Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can see that the effect of the policy is not seen 
in regions where the main damage factor is the limitation of intermediate or production 
supply; although there is some effect in regions where the main damage factor is the 
limitation of labor supply. However, we also found that there are some regions, such as

Inabe-shi or Tahara-shi, where the shortage of labor supply is not largely eliminated even 
though the railway network has recovered. A similar result is observed with policy 2. In the 
coastal area, where the main damage factor is the limitation of intermediate or production 
supply, the economic damage due to the freight factor is largely reduced; however, there 
are regions such as Suzuka-shi, Nishio-shi, or Minato-ku where most of the economic 
damage still remains.

4 Conclusion 
We developed the economic damage assessment model in the short -run and applied the 
model to the Chukyo metropolitan area. We found the following results: 
 The economic damage is mainly seen in the coastal areas where the traveling time increases 
largely. 
 From an industry viewpoint, the transport equipment industry is most seriously 
damaged from the manufacturing industry. 
 In the coastal areas, the limited intermediate or production supply is the main 
damaging factor. On the other hand, in the interior area, the limited labor supply is the 
main damage factor. 
 The effect of the recovery of the road network is much more significant than that of 
the railway network. 
 However, there are some regions where the effects of recovery policies are negligible 
even though only either one of the road network or railway network has recovered. 
Thus, it is assumed that the comprehensive policy, considering the damage factor and 
the regional characteristics (including the development status of the transportation facilities 
or the industrial structure), should be planned.
