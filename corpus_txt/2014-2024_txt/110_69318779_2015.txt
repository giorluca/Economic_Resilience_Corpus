ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
MERLIN G. BRINER*
INTRODUCTION
T-HE 1981 ACT represents a dramatic approach to the revision of the
federal tax law. For the first time in recent history Congress has
drastically reduced income, gift and estate taxes. The goals of the Act as
set forth in the report of the United States Senate Finance Committee are:
to insure economic growth in the future; to upgrade the country's industrial
base; to stimulate productivity and innovation; to lower personal income
taxes; to control the growth of the federal government; to restore certainty
to economic decision making; and to provide a sound basis for economic
recovery. The objective of the $750 billion tax cut to be phased in by 1987
is to restore and create incentives for both individuals and businesses to
"work, produce, save and invest."
In essence this Act and the results it either produces or fails to produce
will be a test of our free enterprise system. The Act, coupled with the ad-
ministration's policy of deregulation and relaxing government controls of
business, provides the opportunity business leaders have been looking for.
A key to future economic health is the reduction of federal expenditures.
If these cannot be curtailed, the combined effect of expenditures and re-
duced tax revenues on inflation will be disasterous. If expenditures cannot
be controlled, then taxes will have to be increased substantially in the not
too distant future.
As this article goes to press, measures the administration is proposing
include: requiring corporations and contractors to pay taxes earlier; elimi-
nating tax credits for insulation and solar heating; restricting the issuance
of tax exempt industrial development bonds; and increasing the income tax
on unemployment pay. Democrats and some Republicans are also urging
that excise taxes on gasoline, telephone calls, cigarettes and liquor be in-
creased; that cost of living increases for retirees be deferred and that oil
tax breaks be restricted.
Compiling this article required a concentrated effort to meet the pub-
lication deadlines for the fall issue of the Law Review. This article, in
addition to the annual Tax Developments article, proved the dedication
of the contributing authors and the Law Review staff. Appreciation is

1.01 Individual Income Tax Rate Changes
I.R.C. §§ 1, 1348 - Act § 101. Effective for rate changes 10-1-81
and for repeal 12-31-81.
After October 1, 1981, tax rates for individuals will be reduced the
equivalent of 5% for the remainder of 1981. The reduction will be accom-
plished by means of a 1.25% credit against tax liability. For example, a
taxpayer who owes $3,398 in taxes will receive a $42.48 credit against this
amount. For 1982 and 1983, the rates will be decreased 10% each year.
In 1984, the remaining 5% of the cut will go into effect. The overall result
of these reductions will be a 23% cut in rates from the present structure.
A married taxpayer filing jointly who earns $27,500 in 1981 will
pay $5,433 in taxes. In 1984, the tax on the same salary will be $4,190,
a savings of $1,243. The present marginal rates range from 14% to 70%
while the new rates, when the cuts are finally phased in, will range from
11% to 50%. Because the highest marginal tax rate has now been dropped
to 50%, the section 1348 provision for the maximum tax on earned per-
sonal service income is no longer necessary, and it has therefore been re-
pealed. Where possible, it is advantageous to most taxpayers to shift de-
ductions into the 1981 tax year and to defer income until 1982. If the
taxpayer knows that certain deductible items will be owing in 1982, he
may'wish to consider prepayment in order to take maximum advantage of
the benefits of the new law.

AKRON LAW REVIEW
1.02 Maximum Capital Gains Rate - Personal Holding Company Rate
Act §§ 101, 102. Effective as to exchanges after 6-9-81.
I.R.C. § 541 - Act § 101. Effective after 12-31-81.
With the maximum tax rate now scheduled to be 50%, the tax on
capital gains has effectively dropped from 28% (70% rate x .40) to 20%
(50% x .40). This provision affects all sales or exchanges made after June
9, 1981, and will therefore result in an increased flow of capital before the
end of the year.
A taxpayer who has net capital gain in 1981 must make two separate
computations and pay tax on the lesser amount. First the tax is computed
on all of the taxable income including 40% of qualified net capital gain.
The tax is then computed on all income other than 40% of qualified net
capital gain plus 20% tax on qualified net capital gain.
The change in the maximum tax rate will also affect the rate on un-
distributed personal holding company income. This rate will drop from
70% to the new maximum 50%.
1.03 Alternative Minimum Tax
I.R.C. § 55(a) - Act § 102. Effective as to transfers after 6-9-81.
The new Act lowers the alternative minimum tax on items of tax
preference. The rate for tax year 1982 will be 10% on amounts from
$20,000 to $60,000 and 20% on the excess above $60,000. For the re-
mainder of 1981, a special rule will apply. The tax will be the lesser of
the tax computed according to the usual method or the tax an alternative
minimum taxable income other than qualified net capital gain plus a 20%
tax on qualified net capital gain.
1.04 Marriage Tax Lessened
I.R.C. § 221 - Act § 103. Effective after 12-31-81.
In providing for the joint filing of income tax returns in 1948, Con-
gress intended to promote the marital relationship by giving it a certain tax
preference. Joint filing served this aim because most women were not em-
ployed outside the home and there was only one income to be considered.
As more women began to work outside the home, an unforseen complica-
tion arose. When the woman's salary was added to that of her husband, the
couple was pushed into a higher tax bracket and was forced to pay more
than if each had filed separate returns. Some couples attempted year-end
divorces to counter this effect, while others saw this tax result as a reason
to delay or avoid marriage.
The Economic Recovery Tax Act attempts to alleviate this problem
by giving a deduction of 5% in 1982, and 10% thereafter, for either
$30,000 or the earned income of the lower paid spouse, whichever is less.
In other words, a maximum deduction of $1,500 is allowed in 1982 and
[Vol. 15:2

https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol15/iss2/3
ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAx AcT oF 1981
$3,000 thereafter. The deduction is to be taken from gross income, so that
in order to use it, a couple need not itemize. Certain deductible items, in-
cluding trade or business expenses, certain employee business expenses,
contributions to either Keoghs, IRAs or Subchapter S pension plans, or re-
quired repayments of supplemental unemployment benefits, must be de-
ducted in computing qualified earned income.
The marriage penalty has been most severe for those couples whose
incomes are relatively equal. Consider the effect on a husband and wife
each earning $22,000 per year, for a combined total of $44,000. In 1982,
they can deduct $1,100 from their gross income (5% of the lesser income
up to $1,500) leaving a total of $42,900 for a tax bill of $10,326, assum-
ing no deductions. If, however, each had filed separately, the tax for each
would be $4,372 for a combined total of $8,744. The marriage tax here is
still $1,582.
If the taxpayer uses the exemption and zero bracket amounts as he
should, the difference becomes even greater because the zero bracket amount
for an unmarried person is $2,300 and only $3,400 for a married couple,
not $4,600. It is in this area that future legislation will be necessary. One
possible solution would be to allow married persons to elect to file as
single if it is to their advantage. This would achieve the desired result without
the present complications.
1.05 Exclusion for Dependent Care
I.R.C. § 129 - Act § 124(e)(1). Effective after 12-31-81.
If an employer provides dependent care program assistance, either by
payment or by provision of services which would be employment-related
expenses for an individual, the amount so provided is not considered in-
come to the employee. However, the maximum expense limitations of
$2,400/$4,800 applicable to persons still apply just as they do under the
child care credit provisions. Any amounts in excess of these figures cannot
be excluded from the employee's income. The exclusion is allowed for pay-
ments to either an employee's child under age 19 or an individual related
to the employee, if they are claimed as dependency exemptions.
In order to qualify, the program must be in writing and for exclusive
benefit of employees. It must not discriminate in favor of officers, owners
or highly compensated individuals. If a union and employer engage in good
faith bargaining which results in exclusion of union employees, however,
this discrimination will not disqualify the program. No more than 25%
of the assistance may be provided to shareholders or owners of more than
5 % of the stock, capital or profit interest. The program need not be funded.
Eligible employees must be given reasonable notice of the availability and
terms of the program. A yearly written statement must be given each em-

ployee indicating the amounts paid or the expenses incurred by the em-
ployer in providing the care during the preceding year.
If an amount is excluded under this provision, the same amount cannot
also be deducted or used as a credit elsewhere on the tax return. None of
the amounts excluded by the employee are subject to withholding, social
security or unemployment tax.
This is an excellent fringe benefit which should prove to be extremely
valuable to both the employer and the employee because of the increased
number of women who are now employed.
1.06 Savings Interest Exclusion
I.R.C. § 128 - Act § 301. Effective after 9-30-81.
Because of extensive lobbying by the savings industry, as well as a
congressional desire to encourage savings, the Economic Recovery Tax Act
grants a $1,000 individual lifetime exclusion for tax exempt savings cer-
tificates. Married persons filing joint returns may exclude a total of $2,000.
There are very strict rules which must be followed in order for the
certificate to qualify. The certificate must: (1) be issued after September
30, 1981, and before January 1, 1983; (2) be issued by a qualified sav-
ings institution (defined in section 128); (3) be available in denominations
of $500; (4) have a maturity of one year; and (5) yield 70% of the average
investment yield for the most recent auction of 52-week Treasury Bills.
If a person pledges this certificate as collateral, it shall be treated as
redeemed and the exclusion will be lost. Also, the penalty for early withdrawal
of funds in this certificate is a loss of the interest exclusion on that particular
certificate.
For an institution other than a credit union to qualify to issue the
certificates, the institution must provide qualified residential financing dur-
ing the succeeding calendar quarter that is not less than the lesser of 75%
of the face amount of certificates issued during the calendar year or 75%
of the qualified net savings for the calendar quarter. In other words, each
institution is obligated to lend 75% of the money it is receiving from
these certificates or 75% of its net savings. This provision con-
stitutes an effort to stimulate the housing industry by providing more funds
for loans. However, the wording is such that the industry believes it can
comply with this requirement without actually directly making new loans
with these new deposits.
1.07 Child and Dependent Care Credit
:LR.C. § 44A -Act § 124. Effective after 12-31-81.
The Tax Reform Act of 1976 changed child care expenses -resulting
from parental :employment from a deduction to a credit. The maximum,
expense allowed in calculating the credit was $2;000 for 1 child, and $4,000
[Vol. 15:2

Akron Law Review, Vol. 15 [1982], Iss. 2, Art. 3
https://ideaexchange.uakron.edu/akronlawreview/vol15/iss2/3
ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
for 2 or more children. The credit was 20% of the expenses or a maximum
of $400 and $800, respectively.
Under the Economic Recovery Tax Act, the percentage of allowable
credit is increased to 30% of the employment related expenses for a person
with an adjusted gross income of $10,000 or less. The ceiling on expenses
is increased to $2,400 for one child and $4,800 for two or more. The 30%
credit is reduced 1% for each additional $2,000 of earned income up to
$28,000. The credit is 20% for earned income over $28,000. Congress
increased the credit as a work incentive, especially for persons in low and
middle income brackets. The definition of employment related expenses
for outside services has been broadened to cover not only a dependent
under 15, but also an individual who regularly spends at least 8 hours each
working day in the taxpayer's household.
In order to receive a credit for the expenses of a dependent child care
center, the center must comply with state and local laws and provide care
for more than 6 children. This will probably eliminate many small home
care centers that may or may not be providing quality care.
Employment related expenses cannot exceed the individuals' earned
income if they are not married. If married, the expenses may not exceed
the lesser of the earned income of the taxpayer or the spouse. Income is
imputed to a dependent spouse who is either a student or incapacitated.
As a result of the increase in allowable expense for the care of a student
or an incapacitated spouse, it is necessary to increase the amount of income
imputed to such a spouse. Thus, imputed income is increased from $166
to $200 per month for families with one qualifying dependent and from
$333 to $400 per month if there are two or more qualifying dependents.
1.08 Indexing
I.R.C. § 1(f), 151(f) - Act § 104. Effective after 12-31-84.
As a result of inflation, many individuals have received an increase in
wages. However, their actual purchasing power has remained the same or
decreased because they have been forced into higher marginal tax brackets.
This "bracket creep" is the result of considering an increase in income as
a taxable gain rather than a nontaxable event which restores the status quo.
As more and more individuals are taxed at higher marginal tax brackets
without a corresponding increase in their lifestyle, the net result is a
greater tax liability.
The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 will reduce this "bracket
creep." Beginning with taxes in 1985, the amounts of personal exemptions,
zero bracket amounts and tax bracket amounts will be tied to the Con-
sumer Price Index. On September 30 of each year the amount of change
in the Consumer Price Index from the preceding year will be determined

in order to prepare new tax tables. The base year for the Consumer Price
index will be 1983. If the 1984 price index is higher than that of the base
year, that percentage of change will be used to adjust these various factors
upward.
There has been some fear expressed that by indexing in this manner,
inflation will become institutionalized, and the incentive of the taxpayer
to control it will be dissipated. However, it will take some years of experience
before the effectiveness of indexing can be determined. Hopefully, by
1985 when this procedure is begun, inflation will be controlled.
1.09 Residential Exclusion Amount for over 55's Increased
I.R.C. § 121(b) - Act § 123. Effective after 7-20-81.
Recognizing the effect which inflation has had on the selling prices
of homes, the Economic Recovery Tax Act increases the amount of the
one-time exclusion of gain realized on the sale of a principal residence by
a person 55 years or older. The residence must have been owned as such
for 3 of the last 5 years. A married taxpayer filing a joint return may
now exclude up to $125,000 of the gain on a sale rather than the $100,000
allowed under the 1976 Act. A single person is limited to an exclusion
of $62,500.
For example, a 59-year-old taxpayer sells his principal home for
$110,000 which he has owned for 15 years. The basis in the property is
$35,000 and there are selling and pre-sale fixup expenses of $16,500. The
realized gain is $58,500. If the taxpayer elects to use the exclusion now,
the entire gain is excluded from income. This is a one-time opportunity
for taxpayers and there is no carry forward as to any unused portion of
the total exclusion.
1.10 Sale of Residence Roll-Over Period Increased
I.R.C. § 1034 - Act § 122. Effective after 7-20-81 for sales and
exchanges.
A taxpayer now has two years in which to invest the proceeds from the
sale of a principal residence into an equally or more expensive residence
without recognizing gain. Previously the two-year period had been available
only if the taxpayer was building a home, while for the purchase of an
existing residence the period was 18 months.
Perhaps the most helpful aspect of this section is that it applies to
sales or exchanges whose 18 month roll-over period had not expired as
of July 20, 1981. Because of the sluggish character of the home sale mar-
ket, many people have been unwilling to commit to a high interest mortgage
even to avoid recognizing gain. There is now a longer period available to
determine what action they will take.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
1.11 Dividend Interest Exclusion
I.R.C. § 116 - Act § 302. Effective after 12-31-81.
Under prior law, the exclusion available for interest and dividend in-
come was increased to $200 for an individual return and $400 for a joint
return. This has been effective for only one tax year, 1981, because the
Economic Recovery Tax Act reenacts the exclusion for dividends to $100
for individuals and $200 for taxpayers filing joint returns. In recommend-
ing this action, the Committee stated that it did not believe that the previous
excluded amounts had been sufficient to stimulate savings. Other provisions
in the Act, particularly the exemption for all savers certificates, provide
new and better incentives.
Starting with the 1985 tax year, a taxpayer will be allowed to exclude
from gross income earned interest up to a maximum of $450 for a single
return, $900 for married, filing jointly. This amount will be computed
by taking 15% of the lesser of $3000 on a single return or $6000 for a
joint return or the net difference between the amount of interest paid and
interest earned. To arrive at this figure it will not be necessary to include
any interest payments on either home mortgages or trade or business re-
lated loans. These particular amounts will continue to be fully deductible by
the taxpayer. This action is yet another manifestation of the desire of Con-
gress to encourage Americans to save.
2:00 Corporate Business Tax Changes
2.01 Corporate Charitable Deduction Raised
I.R.C. § 170(b)(2) - Act § 263. Effective in tax years beginning
after December 31, 1981.
Previously corporations could deduct their contributions to charity
up to a maximum of 5 % of their taxable income. The Act raises this limit
to 10% of taxable income. This is apparently a concession to charitable
institutions affected by previous budget cuts.
2.02 Gifts and Awards to Employees
I.R.C. § 274(b) - Act § 265. Effective in tax years ending on or aftei
date of enactment.
Gifts of tangible personal property to an employee costing $100 or
less have been deductible for an employer where the gift was given for the
employee's service or safety record. The limit on deductibility has now
been increased to $400. In addition, a new category of awards, the qualified
plan award, has been created. Awards given for productivity also qualify
under the Act.
A qualified plan award is an award given pursuant to a permanent
written plan which does not discriminate in favor of officers, shareholders,
or highly compensated employees with regard to eligibility or benefits. Al-

AKRON LAW REVIEW
though the average cost of all items awarded cannot exceed $400, individual
awards can cost up to $1,600 and still be eligible for the qualified plan
award.
It should be noted that the Act did not increase the $25 limitation
of section 274(b)(1) for gifts to other individuals, such as customers or
clients.
2.03 Corporate Tax Rates Lowered
I.R.C. § 11(b) - Act § 231(a). Effective in years beginning after 1981.
Effective in years starting after December 31, 1981, the corporate in-
come tax rate drops to 16% from 17% for any income not greater than
$25,000. For income over $25,000 but not over $50,000, the rate drops
from 20% to 19%. Another reduction occurs for years beginning after
December 31, 1982. The rate becomes 15% for the $0 to $25,000 bracket
and 18% for the $25,000 to $50,000 bracket. The statutory procedure for
proration may be found in section 21.
Assuming a calendar year as the tax year, a corporation with $25,000 of
income per year will pay $250 less tax in 1982, and $500 less tax in 1983
and beyond. A corporation making $50,000 per year will pay $500 less
tax in 1982, and $1,000 less tax in 1983 and beyond. This reduction
coupled with the increase in the accumulated earnings credit from $150,000
to $250,000 provides an incentive for small corporations to retain funds
in the corporation.
2.04 Tax Credit and Extension of Loss Carryovers
I.R.C. §§ 44E (e), 46(b), 50A(b), 53(b), 172(b) & (g), 812(b), 825(d) -
Act § 207. Effective date varies.
Carryovers of net operating losses are extended from 7 to 15 years for
tax years ending after 1975. Also covered under the 15-year rule are regu-
lated transportation companies and certain insurance companies which
previously had 9 and 8 year carryovers respectively.
Similarly, the carryover period for unused investment tax credits and
work incentive program credits is lengthened from 7 years to 15 years for
years ending after 1973. Furthermore, the carryover period for the new
employee credit is expanded to 15 years from 7 years for years beginning
after 1976. The Act also extends the alcohol fuels credit carryover period
for years ending after September 30, 1980 from 7 to 15 years.
2.05 Subchapter S Corporations
I.R.C. § 1371(e) & (g) - Act § 234. Effective for tax years beginning
after December 31, 1981.
Previously, the maximum number of shareholders a corporation could
have and still qualify under Subchapter S was 15. This is increased to 25
by the Economic Recovery Tax Act.

2.06 Accumulated Earnings Tax Credit Increased
I.R.C. §§ 243(b)(3)(c)(i), 535(c)(2) & (3), 1561(a)(2) - Act § 232.
Effective in tax years beginning after December 31, 1981.
To allow for the ravages of inflation, the minimum credit to offset ac-
cumulated earnings for the accumulated earnings tax on corporations is
increased from $150,000 to $250,000. However, personal service corpo-
rations whose principal business is providing services in health, law, engi-
neering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts or
consulting, retain only a $150,000 minimum credit. This reflects the belief
that most personal service corporations do not require a substantial working
capital.
3.00 Business Incentive Provisions
3.01 Election to Expense Certain Assets

Prior law allowed an additional first-year depreciation allowance, or
"bonus" depreciation, of up to 20% of the cost of qualified personal prop-
erty. This was limited to a maximum deduction of $2,000 for corporations,
partnerships and single individuals or $4,000 for married individuals filing
joint returns. The new law repeals this additional first-year deduction for
property placed in service after December 30, 1980, and substitutes an
election to treat the cost of certain assets as an expense. The new election
is available for property placed in service after December 31, 1981, there-
fore allowing neither "bonus" depreciation nor a deduction for property
placed in service during 1981. This oversight may be corrected by the tech-
nical corrections act which always follows a major tax bill.
The maximum amount that may be expensed is $5,000 per year for
property placed in service during 1982 and 1983. The limit increases to
$7,500 in 1984 and 1985. For 1986 and later, the limitation is $10,000.
These dollar limitations are reduced by 50% for married individuals filing
separate returns. The amount expensed does not qualify for the investment
credit.
The election is available for personal property eligible to be treated as
recovery property, if it is acquired by purchase for use in a trade or business
and is eligible for the investment credit. The "use" requirement means
that property held merely for the production of income does not qualify.
The "purchase" requirement means that property will not be eligible if
acquired from a related person or from a controlled group of which taxpayer
is a member, or if the basis of the property is in whole or in part a carryover
basis.
A "controlled group" of corporations (as determined under Code sec-
tion 1563 using a 50% test), is treated as one taxpayer, and must therefore

allocate the dollar limitation among members of the group. Also, the dollar
limitation applies both to partnerships and to each partner. The new law
further provides that any portion of the basis of the property which is de-
termined by reference to the basis of property traded in is not eligible for the
election. The election must be made on an original return, and the taxpayer
must specify the items of property to which the election applies and the
amount thereof.
A disposition of the property triggers recapture under section 1245 of
the amount expensed as ordinary income. If expensed property has been
disposed of in an installment sale, the taxpayer must immediately recognize
any gain to the full amount expensed. The amount of this recognized gain
is then added to the adjusted basis of the property to determine the profit
ratio of the installment payments to be received later. But, because the in-
stallment payments are deemed to be received immediately, the taxpayer's
tax liability arising from the transaction could conceivably exceed the pay-
ments actually received during that tax year. The best way to avoid this
situation is not to sell expensed property for installment notes. If the tax-
payer must sell in installments, he should make certain that the payments
he receives in the year of the sale are at least equal to his tax liability aris-
ing from the sale. Because the investment credit is not allowed for ex-
pensed property, the tax benefits from using the shorter accelerated ACRS
method may in some instances exceed the tax benefits of expensing the
property. Taxpayers in lower brackets may find this to be the case because
the credit to them will provide a greater tax benefit than a deduction.
3.02 Anti-Churning Rules
I.R.C. § 168(e)(4) - Act § 201. Effective as to property acquired
after December 31, 1980, and before January 1, 1986.
To prevent a taxpayer from attempting to bring his pre-Accelerated
Cost Recovery System (ACRS) property, which was placed in service before
January 1, 1981, under ACRS through questionable transactions, special
anti-churning rules were included in the new law. To qualify for ACRS
treatment, depreciable personal property acquired by the taxpayer after
December 31, 1980, must not have been (1) owned or used by the tax-
payer or a related person at any time during 1980; (2) acquired from a
person who owned the property at any time during 1980, and the user of
the property has not changed; (3) leased to a person (or a person related
to such person) who owned or used the property at any time during 1980);
or (4) acquired in a transaction in which the user does not change and the
property did not qualify as ACRS property in the hands of the person from
whom the property is acquired by reason of (2) or (3) above. The require-
ment of user change prevents sale and leaseback transactions from qualifying.
These new rules do not apply to property "owned" in 1980 but not used

until after 1980. Property is not owned for purposes of this section until it is
in service.
Depreciable real property will not qualify for ACRS treatment if the
property was acquired after December 31, 1980, and if the property
had been (1) owned by the taxpayer or a related person at any time during
1980; (2) leased to a person (or a person related to such person) who
owned such property at any time during 1980; or (3) acquired certain like
kind exchanges, "rollovers" of low-income housing, involuntary conversions,
or repossessions, for property owned by the taxpayer or a related person
during 1980. This last requirement applies only to the extent of the sub-
stituted basis in the property, so any remaining basis attributable to boot
is eligible for ACRS treatment.
A related person is defined under section 267(b) or section 707(b)(1)
using the 10% test for control rather than the 50% test, or persons en-
gaged in trades or businesses under common control using the control
tests of sections 52(a) and (b). An exception to the related person test is
a corporation which purchases stock to get assets in a section 334(b)(2)
corporate liquidation.
The Secretary is given broad powers to enforce the anti-churning rules,
and any property which is acquired in a transaction for the purpose of
avoiding the anti-churning rules will be denied ACRS treatment. In addi-
tion, similar anti-churning rules are to be issued by the IRS to prevent
taxpayers from attempting to qualify property placed in service before
1985 or 1986 for the more accelerated methods of cost recovery which
go into effect after 1984.
3.03 Minimum Tax on Accelerated Cost Recovery System
I.R.C. § 57 -Act § 2.05. Effective as to property placed in service
December 31, 1980.
Under prior law, accelerated depreciation of real property or leased
personal property was an item of tax preference subject to the 15% mini-
mum tax imposed by section 56. The same rules hold true for Accelerated
Cost Recovery System (ACRS) property. The amount subject to the mini-
mum tax for real property is the excess of the ACRS deduction for the
tax year over the allowable straight line deduction using a 15 year re-
covery period with no salvage value. For leased personal property, it is the
excess of the ACRS deduction for the year over the allowable straight
line deduction using extended recovery periods with no salvage value. The
half-year convention is also required. The extended recovery periods are
five years for 3-year property, eight years for 5-year property, 15 years for
10-year property, and 22 years for 15-year property. The effect of the
extended recovery periods is to increase the amount subject to the prefer-
ence tax by lowering the allowable straight line deduction. These rules are

not applicable to corporations other than Subchapter S or personal holding
companies.
3.04 Accelerated Cost Recovery System for Personal Property
I.R.C. §§ 168, 263, 1245 - Act §§ 201, 204. Effective as to
property placed in service after December 31, 1980.
Under prior law, depreciation deductions were designed to reflect the
recovery of cost over the useful life of an asset. The midpoint lives in the
Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) were based upon actual industry expe-
rience, and the taxpayer could elect to depreciate an asset over any period
between 80% and 120% of the ADR midpoint life of the asset. The tax-
payer could also elect not to use ADR, but the useful lives chosen would
have to be determined according to the facts and circumstances pertaining
to each asset. Another choice available to the taxpayer was the election to
use the straight line method of depreciation or certain accelerated methods.
The Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) replaces ADR with
recovery periods that are generally shorter than the useful lives of the
assets and tables that are based on accelerated methods of depreciation.
There are also several elections available to the taxpayer to provide flexi-
bility. One election is to exclude property from ACRS and depreciate it
under any method of depreciation not expressed in a term of years, such
as the unit-of-production method.
The recovery periods under ACRS are 3, 5, 10 or 15 years, depending
upon the type of asset to be depreciated. Personal property placed in the
3-year class includes automobiles, light duty trucks, equipment used for
research and development, machinery or equipment with an ADR midpoint
life of four years or less, race horses which are more than two years old
when placed in service, or any horse that is more than 12 years old when
placed in service. The 5-year class contains all depreciable personal property
not included in other classes, single-purpose agricultural structures, facili-
ties for the storage of petroleum and its primary products, and public
utility property with an ADR midpoint life of 18 years or less. The 10-year
class contains public utility property with an ADR midpoint life of at least
18.5 years but no more than 25 years, railroad tank cars, section 1250
property with an ADR midpoint life of 12.5 years or less, and qualified
coal utilization property not included in the 5-year or 15-year classes. The
15-year class of personal property contains only public utility property with
an ADR midpoint life of more than 25 years.
The cost recovered for each year is computed by multiplying the un-
adjusted basis of the property by the applicable percentage for the property.
The unadjusted basis of an asset is the excess of its basis for purposes of
determining gain over the sum of that portion of the basis that is to be
amortized plus that portion that the taxpayer elects to treat as an expense.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
The applicable percentage comes from tables now contained in the Code
itself. For property placed in service from 1981-1984, the tables are based
upon the 150% declining balance method in the earlier years and the
straight line method in the later years. For property placed in service in
1985, the tables are based on the 175% declining balance method in the
earlier years and the sum-of-the-years-digits method in the later years.
For property placed in service after December 31, 1985, the tables are
based upon the 200% declining balance method for the earlier years and
the sum-of-the-years-digits method for the later years. The tables do not
take salvage value into consideration. Therefore, the entire cost of every
asset is eventually recovered.
It is interesting to note that while the ACRS has been hailed as a
great tax savings, the depreciation deduction using double declining balance
on a $12,000 car purchased in early January using pre-1981 depreciation
would be:
Year Pre-1981 ACRS- 1981 Difference
1 $ 8,000 $ 3,000 $ 5,000
2 $ 2,667 $ 4,560 ($ 1,893)
3 $ 889 $ 4,440 ($ 3,551)
Total $11,556 $12,000 $ 444
The Code section 168 tables also incorporate the half-year convention, which
assumes that every asset was placed in service in the middle of the year.
The half-year convention is advantageous for the taxpayer if the depreci-
able asset is placed into service towards the end of the year, but is dis-
advantageous if the depreciable asset is placed into service at the be-
ginning of the year. The half-year convention is mandatory.
Several elections designed to provide flexibility are available to the
taxpayer. If the taxpayer does not desire to use the accelerated method of
cost recovery in the tables, an election may be made to recover the cost
over the applicable ACRS period using the straight line method. Also, once
the taxpayer elects to use the straight line method, he may also elect to
extend the period of recovery to the longer recovery periods used to cal-
culate earnings and profits for the asset or for property in the next higher
class. Thus, the optional periods for 3-year property are 3, 5, or 12 years;
for 5-year property, 5, 12, or 25 years; for 10-year property, 10, 25, or
35 years; and for 15-year property, 15, 35, or 45 years. In all cases, the
half-year convention must be used. Furthermore, the same percentage
must be used for all personal property of the same class (e.g., ACRS 3-
year property) which is put into service in the same year.
Upon disposition of depreciable personal property, gain or loss is gen-
erally recognized unless some provision of the Code provides for nonrecog-

nition. Cost that has been recovered under ACRS is still recaptured under
section 1245. Therefore, because the cost recovery deduction in the year
of disposal would be recaptured as ordinary income in any case, no de-
duction is allowed for ACRS personal property in that year. A special rule
concerning the disposition of assets from mass asset accounts allows gain
to be recognized to the extent of proceeds and leaves the unadjusted basis
of the property in the account until fully recovered in future years. The
purpose of this special rule is to avoid calculation of gain on the disposition
of these assets. Amounts that had been expensed in the year of acquisition
must also be recaptured as ordinary income, and dispositions may cause
some recapture of the investment credits.
3.05 Accelerated Cost Recovery System Writeoffs for Real Property
I.R.C. §§ 167, 168, 1250 - Act §§ 201, 203, 204. Effective as to
property placed in service after December 31, 1980.
Under prior law, real property was depreciated over its useful life,
usually from 30 to 60 years. Under the new law, the cost of most real estate
can be recovered over a period of only 15 years and the cost of real prop-
erty, which had a previous Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) midpoint life
of 12.5 years or less, can be recovered over a period of only 10 years.
This category includes theme park structures and manufactured homes.
The rules and cost recovery tables pertaining to Accelerated Cost Recovery
System (ACRS) 10-year property apply to them. However, the class con-
sisting of 15-year real property has its own rules and cost recovery tables.
The cost recovery deduction is computed by multiplying the unadjusted
basis of the property by the applicable percentage from tax tables issued by the
IRS. The table for most of the 15-year class of real property is based upon the
175% declining balance method of recovery for the earlier years and the
straight line method of recovery for the later years. The table for low-income
housing is based upon the 200% declining balance method in the earlier years
and the straight line method in the later years. No salvage value is considered
in the deduction, and, unlike the tables for depreciable personal property,
the tables do not use the half-year convention. Instead, they consider the
number of months the property has been in service. The taxpayer is also
entitled to a deduction for the number of months the property is in service
during the year of disposition. Thus, there is no advantage or disadvantage
concerning purchases or dispositions of real property which occur in the
early or later parts of the tax year.
Elections available to the taxpayer concerning real property are simi-
lar to those available for personal property. The taxpayer may elect to use
the straight line method of cost recovery rather than the accelerated meth-
ods of the tables. Also, once an election to use the straight line method, has
been made, the taxpayer can recover his costs over the normal period of
(Vol. 15:2

ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
15 years or over either of the extended recovery periods of 35 or 45 years.
Furthermore, these elections can be made on a property-by-property basis.
The 1981 Act also eliminates composite depreciation. Under prior
law, a taxpayer could allocate the cost of a building to its component parts,
such as wiring and plumbing, and depreciate these components separately
using shorter life spans than that of the structure itself. Now the entire
building must be depreciated as a whole, with the result that the cost of all
components must be recovered using the same methods and percentages
as those used for the building itself. An exception to the composite de-
preciation requirement exists for substantial improvements which may be
treated as separate structures. Because of this exception, a substantial im-
provement can have different recovery methods or periods from those of
the original building. This rule will also allow a substantial improvement
to qualify for ACRS treatment if made after December 31, 1980, even
though the original building must still be depreciated under the ADR rules.
The new rules concerning treatment of gain or loss upon disposition
of depreciable real property will be extremely important to the tax planner.
The treatment for gain on the sale of residential real property remains the
same as before. That part of the gain which reflects the excess of the de-
ductions taken using an accelerated method of cost recovery over the
deductions which would have been taken if the straight line method had
been used over 15 years is treated as ordinary income. However, if the real
property is non-residential and an accelerated method of cost recovery
has been used, all gain up to the total amount of deductions taken is treated
as ordinary income. But if the taxpayer elects to use the straight line method,
all gain will be capital gain.
Therefore, taxpayer should compute the present values of the excess
of the tax benefits of the accelerated deductions over the tax benefits of
straight line deductions. The present value of the excess of the tax liability
accruing from recapture of ordinary income over the liability accruing
from capital gains should also be computed. These computations should then
reveal whether there is any benefit to the taxpayer in using the accelerated
method of cost recovery. The taxpayer may elect to use the straight line
method of cost recovery when the beneficial tax treatment given to proceeds
from the sale of property outweighs the disadvantages of smaller cost re-
covery deductions. This, however, might only occur when the taxpayer plans
to sell or exchange the property in the future.
3.06 Carryover of Recovery Attributes
I.R.C. § 381 - Act § 208. Effective as to property placed in service
after December 31, 1980.

ted parties, the acquiring corporation shall be treated as the distributor or
transferor corporation for purposes of computing the cost recovery deduc-
tion. The acquiring corporation must therefore use the same cost recovery
method and period with respect to the transferred property that was used
by the transferring corporation. This rule applies only to the extent that
the acquiring corporation's basis does not exceed the transferor's adjusted
basis. Property transferred in the liquidation of a subsidiary or a tax-free
organization are the transactions which will give rise to the attribute carry-
over rules.
3.07 Calculating Earnings and Profits Under Accumulated Cost Recovery
System
I.R.C. § 312(k) - Act § 206. Effective as to property placed in service
after December 12, 1980.
Since distributions by a corporation to its shareholders are taxable as
dividends only to the extent the distribution is from current or accumulated
earnings and profits, the increased depreciation expenses caused by ACRS
would result in lower earnings and profits. This decrease would allow tax-
free or capital gain distributions. To prevent this possibility, Congress man-
dated that the depreciation used in calculating earnings and profits must
be computed by using the straight line method over extended recovery
periods. These extended periods are five years for 3-year property, twelve
years for 5-year property, 25 years for 10-year property, and 35 years for
15-year property. If the corporation elected to use a longer recovery period
than the applicable period above, that longer period must be used to compute
earnings and profits. Foreign corporations, however, compute their earnings
and profits under the same rules which govern the computation of de-
preciation of foreign assets under ACRS.
3.08 Research and Development Credit
I.R.C. § 44F, 55(c)(4), 381(c), 6411, 6511 - Act § 221. Effective for
amounts paid or incurred after June 30, 1981 and before January 1,
1986.
Under prior law, expenditures for research and development were
capitalized and amortized over not less than 60 months unless the taxpayer
elected to currently deduct the expenditures. To provide incentives for
further expenditures for research and development, Congress created a new
tax credit. Other incentives to increase research and development are the
inclusion of such equipment in the 3-year class of the accelerated cost
recovery system, liberalized deductions for certain charitable gifts of re-
search and development equipment, and suspension of Treasury Regulation§ 1.861-8 which required allocation of research and development expendi-
tures to foreign income.
The new tax credit is computed as 25% of the excess of certain re-

search and experimental expenditures for the current year over the base
period research expense. To find the base period research expense, the tax-
payer must average the qualified research expenditures for the three tax-
able years preceding the determination year. Qualified research expenses
are those which are paid or incurred by the taxpayer in carrying on a trade
or business for either in-house research expenses or contract research ex-
penses. Since these expenses must be incurred for "carrying on" rather than
"in connection with" the trade or business, it will be slightly more difficult
to qualify for the new credit than it will be to elect for current expenditures.
Qualified in-house research expenses encompass: wages for employees
engaged in research or in direct supervision of research; the cost of supplies
used in research; and the cost of certain leases or other charges for computers.
The term "wages" does not include fringe benefits which are not subject
to withholding, nor does it include the expense of employing administrative
personnel. Qualified contract research expenses are 65% of amounts paid
to individuals, colleges, universities or research firms for performing quali-
fied research. Grants to tax exempt funds also qualify if the funds are paid
to a college or university for basic research.
Base period research expenses are generally the average of the qualified
research expenses of the preceding three years. However, there is a transi-
tional rule for taxpayers whose first taxable year to which the new credit
applies begins in 1980 or 1981, or for taxpayers whose second taxable
year to which the new credit applies begins in 1981 or 1982. In no case
shall the taxpayer's base period research expenses be less than 50% of
his current research expenses. This limits the increase in expenditures quali-
fying for the credit to a maximum of 50% of total qualified current ex-
penditures.
Qualified research consists of the research to discover information
or the application of such information to new business items or to improve-
ments of existing business items. However, testing for quality control or
efficiency surveys do not qualify. Other exclusions are research conducted
outside the United States, research in the humanities or social sciences, or
research funded by any grantor contract by another person or any govern-
ment entity.
All corporate members of a controlled group, to which the 50% control
test applies, must aggregate their research expenditures and then allocate
the proportionate share of any increase of research expenditures which
would give rise to the credit. This prevents artificial increases from shifting
expenditures among the members of the group. In addition, all trades or
businesses under common control must similarly aggregate and allocate
research expenditures according to regulations to be issued. There are also
special allocation rules for transactions involving the acquiring of a trade
or business which paid or incurred qualifying research expenses.

This new credit is nonrefundable and can be carried back three years
or carried forward 15 years. Even though the requirements of qualifying
for the credit are somewhat stringent, the credit is an added advantage
that did not previously exist. This advantage is restricted because special
pass-through rules limit the credit to the tax attributable to the taxpayer's
interest in an unincorporated trade or business, partnership, Subchapter
S corporation, or trust.
3.09 Safe Harbor Leases
I.R.C. § 168(f)(2) - Act § 201(a). Committee Rep.: H.R. Rep. No.
215, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 217 (1981). Effective immediately for
property placed in service after December 31, 1980.
The Act provides a safe harbor for corporate lessors which substantially
eases the conditions formerly required to deem a transaction a lease. By
meeting these safe harbors, the lessor obtains depreciation deductions and
investment tax credits which arise from the leased property, i.e., the lessor
is treated as the owner and the transaction is treated as being a lease in
substance and not a sale.
The taxpayer must comply with a number of conditions before relying
on the safe harbors. First, the parties must describe the transaction as a
lease and elect to have this section apply. Second, the lessor must generally
be a corporation. Third, the lessor, from the time the property is first
placed in service and throughout the term of the lease, must maintain an
at-risk investment of not less than 10% of the property's adjusted basis.
Fourth, the term of lease, including any extensions, may not exceed the
greater of 90% of the useful life of the property for purposes of section
167 or 150% of the class life of that property as of the beginning of 1981.
Finally, the lease must be of qualified leased property.
Qualified leased property is recovery property such as depreciable
tangible property used in a trade or business or held for the production of
income. Qualified lease property does not include a qualified rehabilitated
building. Further, qualified leased property generally must be property re-
ferred to in new section 38 that is leased within three months of being placed
in service. Certain mass commuting vehicles also qualify.
Qualified leased property, other than mass commuting vehicles, is
deemed placed in service not earlier than the date such property is used
under the lease. Property placed in service after December 31, 1980, but
before the date of enactment, can qualify for the safe harbor rules if
leased within three months of the enactment date. Where all the safe harbor
tests are met the Act provides that no other factors will be considered in
determining the owner of the property.
In effect, this provision allows the transfer of depreciation deductions
and investment tax credits to corporations with the capacity to "buy" the

deductions and credits and to use them. The lessor shelters income (pre-
sumably at a 46% marginal rate) while the lessee receives a lower cost on
his equipment since the federal government bears a greater share of the cost.
3.10 Incentive Stock Options
I.R.C. § 422A - Act § 251. Effective immediately for options granted
after December 31, 1975 and exercised after December 31, 1980.
A stock option is the employee's right to purchase company stock in
the future at a predetermined price. Stock options offered to employees were
generally taxable when granted under Code section 83. The fair market
value of the option was included in the employee's gross income in the
year in which it was granted as compensation. However, if the fair market
value of that option was not readily ascertainable, income would not be
recognized at the time of the grant. Instead, the employee would recognize
the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value at the
time of exercise. The employer was allowed a deduction equal to the in-
come recognized by the employee in the same year the employee recognized
the income. Under prior law, favorable tax treatment of stock options had
either been repealed or severely restricted because of alleged abuses. Con-
gress believed, however, that tax favored stock options were an important
incentive device to attract new management and retain key employees by
encouraging investment in the business. The Economic Recovery Tax Act
favored treatment for certain stock options known as incentive stock options.
The option must meet certain restrictions to qualify under Act
section 422A(b)(l)-(8). In return for meeting those restrictions, the em-
ployee recognizes income not at the time of the grant, nor at the time of the
exercise, but only when the stock is sold. And, unlike stock options under
prior law, the difference between the fair market value and the value at
the time of exercise is not a tax preference for the add-on minimum tax.
The incentive stock option price must not be less than the fair market
value of the stock at the time of grant. Also, options may be granted in
any one calendar year only for stock with a value of $100,000 or less, plus
any carryover allowed from previous years.
When the stock is sold, the employee receives either long-term capital
gains income or ordinary income depending on the holding period and the
employee's status with the company. To receive long-term capital gains
treatment (and the 60% capital-gains exclusion), the employee must hold
the stock for at least one year after exercise of the option and the sale must
not occur earlier than two years after the option was granted. Additionally,
to receive this beneficial tax treatment, the option cannot have been exer-
cised more than three months after the termination of employment. An
exception is made to the three month rule for disabled employees. They

can exercise their options twelve months after terminating employment and
still receive long-term capital gains treatment.
A major opportunity exists for options already outstanding. If they
otherwise meet the requirements for an incentive stock option and the
granting corporation elects to have this section apply, these options will
qualify for incentive stock option treatment. Act section 251(c) also limits
the amount of options which receive this beneficial "lookback" to an ag-
gregate of $200,000 of the fair market value of the stock with no more
than $50,000 of that attributable to any one year. This provision could
give rise to refund claims for employees previously taxed on such options
where the employee still holds either the option or the stock. However, the
employer may lose his deductions for those options under Code section 83(h).
The Research Institute of America suggests that a pyramiding technique
could be used in situations where the underlying stock appreciates to give
the employee a valuable stake in the company at little cost. The technique
involves paying the option price with shares of the company. More options
may be then exercised with the newly received stock used as payment. This
tactic works for three reasons. First, when the employee exercises an option,
he realizes a gain because the fair market value of the stock received is
greater than the option price. Second, by trading stock, the employee has
low out-of-pocket costs. Third, the exchange of stock apparently is not taxed
as a disposition which would violate the two-year holding period requirement.
Of course, the number of outstanding options places a cap on use of this
technique. The success of this technique, of course, is dependent on the ap-
preciation in fair market value of the stock over time.
The return to the Code of a tax-favored stock option allows corpora-
tions to offer key employees a chance to participate in the future growth
of the company. These options may be used to provide incentive to the
employee to benefit the corporation by benefiting himself.
3.11 Investment Credit - New Percentages Applicable
I.R.C. §§ 46, 47, 48 - Act § 211. Effective as to property placed in
service after December 30, 1980.
Under prior law, an investment credit of 31/3% of the purchase price
was allowed for assets with useful lives of 3 or 4 years; 6%a % was allowed
for assets with useful lives of 5 or 6 years; and 10% was allowed for assets
with useful lives of 7 or more years.
Under the Economic Recovery Tax Act, investment credit is cal-
culated by using the Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) recovery
period of the property rather than its useful life. For eligible property with
a recovery period of 3 years, the investment credit is 6%. For eligible prop-
erty with a 5 or 10 year recovery period or public utility property with a
15 year recovery period, the investment credit is 10%.

ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981
The new law does not change the types of property which are eligible
for the credit, but expands the credit's availability to facilities used to store
petroleum and primary petroleum products. The new law does not limit the
credit to production facilities, but extends it to also encompass distribution
facilities.
The new law also changes the recapture computation for property
which is disposed of prior to expiration of its recovery period. Under prior
law, if the disposition occurred before the useful life had expired, the in-
vestment credit was recomputed using the actual holding period. Therefore,
if an asset had been held for less than 3 years, the entire investment credit
was recaptured. In comparison, the new method of recapture allows a 2%
credit for each year the property is held. For example, if property is disposed
of after 2 years, then only 2% is recaptured for 3 year property and 6%
is recaptured for property with longer recovery periods. Another advantage
of the new law is the extension of the carryforward period for unused in-
vestment credit from 7 to 15 years.
4.00 Retirement Savings Provisions
4.01 Individual Retirement Accounts - Deductions, Contributions and
Eligibility
I.R.C. §§ 219, 220, 401, 405, 408, 409, 415 - Act §§ 311(a), (e), (h),
313 & 314(b). Effective after December 31, 1981.
Aware that personal savings have been declining in relation to per-
sonal disposable income, Congress responded with legislation that would im-
prove capital formation as it generally affects the economy as well as re-
tirement resources for individuals. To promote greater retirement security,
the Economic Recovery Tax Act expanded the contribution, deduction, and
eligibility requirements with respect to Individual Retirement Accounts
(I.R.A.'s). Banks, savings institutions and others who may qualify as I.R.A.
sponsors should also benefit from this new influx of capital.
Under prior law, an employee had to earn at least $10,000 before
reaching the I.R.A. contribution limits of $1,500 or 15% of compensation.
Under the Act, the annual I.R.A. contribution limit is raised to the lesser
of $2,000 or 100% of compensation. An individual earning only $2,000
compensation may now deduct the entire $2,000 contribution. As under
the old I.R.A. rules, "compensation" does not include passive income, such
as royalties, in
