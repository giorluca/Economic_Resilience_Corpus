MAI’s work on the project is part of a larger project to assess and advance opportunities to reduce risk from large-scale storm events, increase the viability and resiliency of natural ecosystems in the project area, and create a Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut. The project focuses on increasing coastal resiliency through natural and green infrastructure and land use. It is managed via a partnership among The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the South Central Regional Council of Governments (SCRCOG) and Connecticut Metropolitan Council of Governments (MetroCOG, formerly Greater Bridgeport Regional Council). MAI’s component of this larger project assesses and audits the legal, policy, and regulatory authorities relevant to natural/green infrastructure and land use in the project area. 1.1 Scope and Methodology The geographic scope of the project includes ten municipalities in southern Connecticut, each of which is a project partner (Fig. 1). Of these ten, Fairfield, Bridgeport, and Stratford are members of MetroCOG, while Milford, West Haven, New Haven, East Haven, Branford, Guilford, and Madison are members of SCRCOG. MAI produced this report through a combination of independent legal research and interviews. Independent research was conducted through direct consideration of federal and state laws and municipal charters, ordinances, and regulations, as well as other relevant sources of legal authority. Interviews were conducted in accordance with a standard protocol (see Appendix A) and were held with key staff from participating municipalities, relevant regional governance organizations, state agency personnel, and other key stakeholders. These interviews were intended to introduce the project to key stakeholders and decision-makers and to gather information to support and strengthen MAI’s independent research. Interviews were conducted off the record and not-for-attribution. MAI produced an initial draft or each chapter of this report based on research and interviews. Each chapter was provided to TNC for review and comment by the core project team, including SCRCOG and MetroCOG. After the draft report was completed, MAI provided it to interviewees, including municipal staff, for review and comment. Comments were incorporated into this final report.   Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  2 | P a g e    Figure 1. Project area (http://www.scrcog.org/documents/coastal_resilience/SC_RFCR_Map_6-2014.pdf) 1.2 Organization of this Report This report is organized into three substantive chapters.  Chapter 2 provides an inventory of legal, policy, and regulatory mechanisms relevant to coastal natural/green infrastructure and land use in the project area. This inventory evaluates the relevant federal, state, regional, and municipal jurisdiction and the laws, regulations, ordinances, and other legal instruments that are used to regulate and manage coastal land use and development.  With this background, chapter 3 provides a detailed audit of legal authorities relevant to specific topics that are central to regional coastal resiliency policy and planning. The audit is built around four key topics, including coastal land use practice; open space; flood hazard mitigation; and transportation infrastructure. Within each topic, the audit assesses each municipality’s laws and policies to compare approaches to resolving specific coastal resiliency and land use challenges. Finally, chapter 4 synthesizes the legal and policy options for advancing coastal natural/green infrastructure and improving overall resilience of municipalities. This chapter identifies policy options associated with overcoming challenges in each of the four key regional coastal resiliency topics discussed in chapter 3. It also presents case studies that illustrate practices used in other states and municipalities to overcome coastal resilience challenges. Chapter 5 offers concluding remarks.   Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  3 | P a g e   2 Inventory of Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Mechanisms This chapter introduces the current jurisdictional and procedural processes and language that:  regulate coastal infrastructure improvement and modification and land use in the project area; and  define and determine land use policy and decision along the coast in the project area. This chapter is organized by level of government and by topic area. It includes sections on relevant direct federal and state regulatory authorities before considering legal mechanisms authorizing municipalities and regional governments to operate. Finally, it inventories legal authorities and processes on a municipality-by-municipality basis. In each of these sections, jurisdictional and procedural processes are separated into the following categories for ease of navigation and reference:  planning and zoning, including building codes, flood and erosion control, coastal management, wetlands regulation, and other issues;  water quality protection;  parks, wildlife, and open space;  transportation infrastructure, including navigation and highways; and  shellfish. In each instance, the relevant entities are reviewed along with their powers, jurisdiction, and processes. Where relevant, implementation is addressed as well by noting the existence of plans and other results of required processes. While some entities and laws are cross-cutting and relevant to more than one of these areas, each is described only in the section where it is most appropriate. In addition, not all topics are relevant in every jurisdiction; such absence of authority is noted where it occurs.  This inventory focuses on regulatory authorities with jurisdiction rather than attempting to comprehensively detail the numerous, highly technical fiscal and funding mechanisms that are or potentially could be connected or relevant to coastal green infrastructure. However, funding contracts or obligations could affect or limit municipal coastal management. For example, removal of a parking structure, funding for construction of which was through a bond secured on future parking revenues, might contradict the bond agreement or result in unanticipated or accelerated direct payments from municipal coffers. To avoid unpleasant surprises, consideration of applicable financial obligations is warranted when scoping specific coastal projects. 2.1 Federal Authorities The federal government is relevant to coastal natural and green infrastructure development through a variety of regulatory and permitting programs, which are described in this section. Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  4 | P a g e   2.1.1 Requirements for Federal Actions, Permits and Licenses, and Funding A wide range of federal legal authorities may require a federal permit, funding decisions, or other federal action to enable coastal green infrastructure and land use. Several key federal laws limit these federal actions and must be observed. 2.1.1.1 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)  NEPA requires assessment of the environmental impact of any major federal action not categorically excluded. Major federal actions may include funding as well as permitting under the federal clean water act or other laws. As a result, NEPA compliance is likely to be required for projects explicitly involving federal partners as well as those requiring permits from federal agencies. 2.1.1.2 Coastal Zone Management Act The Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) provides that federal agency activities, federal license or permit activities, and federal financial assistance to state or local governments with reasonably foreseeable effects on coastal uses or resources of a state’s coastal zone must be consistent with the enforceable policies of the state’s federally-approved coastal zone management program.1 Any objections or required conditions identified by the state may result in non-issuance of a permit or incorporation of required conditions into the action or permit. Connecticut has an approved coastal zone program managed by the Office of Long Island Sound Programs at the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP). The program includes enforceable policies under which federal consistency review can occur.2  2.1.1.3 Endangered Species Act The Endangered Species Act (ESA) protects species of animals and plants that are listed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as threatened or endangered. Among other requirements, the ESA requires all federal agencies to consult with FWS to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry out is not likely to jeopardize the continued existing of any listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.3 This consultation will be required to most, if not all, coastal green infrastructure projects funded in whole or part by the federal government. Protected species, including the piping plover, are present in the study area at least seasonally, which may require project proponents to obtain permits before beginning proposed activities. The ESA also directs the Secretary of the Department of Interior (which houses FWS) to acquire and manage land to conserve fish, wildlife, and plants (including but not limited to listed species), after consultation and through a cooperative agreement with the state concerned, through authority of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956; Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act; and Migratory Bird Conservation Act.4                                                               1 16 U.S.C. § 1456; 15 C.F.R.

Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  5 | P a g e   2.1.1.4 Clean Water Act Section 401 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, more commonly known as the Clean Water Act (CWA), requires that no federal license or permit may be issued for an activity that may result in discharge unless the applicant provides a certification from the state where the discharge will originate. The certification must state that the permit will comply with the CWA, including with applicable state water quality standards.5 Once issue, permits or licenses must contain the necessary conditions or limitations needed to ensure compliance. DEEP is the certifying agency for Connecticut, and thus may be called upon to certify that a wide variety of relevant federal permits comply with state standards, including dredge and fill permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and permits related to transportation. 2.1.1.5 Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (MSA) is the primary legislation governing federal fisheries. While Long Island Sound is exclusively within state waters, certain provisions of the MSA may apply to and limit federal actions. Under the MSA, federal agencies are required to consult with the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) prior to any action or activity that may adversely affect essential fish habitat (EFH) identified by NMFS or a regional fishery management council.6 The acting agency must consider NMFS comments and explain any deviations from the NMFS recommendations. 2.1.1.6 National Historic Preservation Act  The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)7 seeks to preserve historic sites and structures and to encourage state and local historic preservation efforts. It accomplishes this by creating a National Register of Historic Places under the National Park Service.8 Each federal agency9 is responsible for considering the effects of its undertakings (including funding or issuance of a license or authorization) on sites that may be eligible for inclusion on the register10, including providing an opportunity for comment by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, prior to approval of federal funds.11 They are also required to undertake planning and actions to minimize harm to any National Historic Landmark prior to approval of any action that may directly and adversely affect the landmark.12   The program also includes provisions to establish state historic preservation programs, to be headed by a state historic preservation officer.13 The officer’s duties include, among other things, surveying state property; nominating eligible property to the register; preparing and implementing a statewide historic preservation plan; and administering the program of federal assistance in the                                                              5 33 U.S.C. § 1341. 6 16 U.S.C. § 1855; 50 C.F.R.

However, federal legal authorities do limit how state and local land use decisions can be carried out in some cases and could indirectly affect coastal green infrastructure activities, particularly with respect to housing discrimination. In addition, federal authorities related to flooding and disaster planning apply to the actions of state and local governments. 2.1.2.1 National Flood Insurance Program The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) provides flood insurance to at-risk properties in communities that adopt minimum floodplain management regulations instituting, among other things, building standards to minimize structural damage from inundation.17 The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) operates the NFIP and produces Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) identifying Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) based on hydrographic modeling of coastal storms and riverine flooding. Properties within an SFHA which collateralize a federally-backed loan such as a mortgage are required to purchase flood insurance through a participating private insurer using a FEMA standard policy.18 All Connecticut municipalities participate in the NFIP.19 2.1.2.2 Disaster Mitigation Act The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires municipalities to complete a FEMA-approved mitigation plan for eligibility to receive grants from the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program and post-disaster funds from the Hazard Mitigation Grants program.                                                              14 Id. § 302303. 15 Id. §§ 302502, 302503. 16 Id. §§ 305102-305104. 17 National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, Pub.

Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  7 | P a g e   2.1.2.3 Housing Discrimination Constitutional equal protection provisions may restrict how municipal planning and zoning activities are conducted to avoid a discriminatory impact on protected groups.20 In addition, legislation administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) prohibits discrimination in programs receiving federal financial assistance, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (race, color, or national origin), section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (disability), section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (programs and activities receiving community development block grant (CDBG) funding), title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (public housing); and Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (handicap access).21 Coastal green infrastructure and land use programs, most notably those activities funded through CDBG and those proposing retreat or alteration of low-income or public housing, must ensure compliance with these laws and associated regulations.  2.1.3 Water Quality The CWA is the nation’s primary legislation governing water pollution, including discharges from point sources, nonpoint source pollution, and activities involving dredge or fill. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers most of the Act, while certain authorities may be delegated to the States, and USACE issues permits for dredge and fill activities. A number of provisions of the CWA are or may be relevant to coastal green infrastructure activities as discussed here. Section 303 of the Act requires states to establish water quality standards (WQS) for all waters based on the “designated uses” of those waters and including criteria for levels of pollutants consistent with those uses.22 WQS must be reviewed every three years and approved by EPA.23 States must further determine total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) of pollution for all waters that will not achieve the applicable WQS based on technology-based effluent limitations, which also must be EPA-approved.24 The CWA requires a permit to discharge a pollutant from a point source into the waters of the United States through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES).25 NPDES permits must require the polluter to comply with other provisions of the Act, including technology-based effluent limitations established for different categories of point sources (established by EPA regulations) and water quality limitations to ensure that the receiving water attains water quality                                                              20 See, e.g., Hamer v. Darien PZC, Memorandum of Decision on Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, 3:11–cv–1845-WWE (D. Conn.

Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  8 | P a g e   standards.26 Specific requirements apply to publicly owned treatment works (POTWs), although waivers are available for those discharging into certain marine waters.27 Certain stormwater discharges are regulated as point sources, including municipal storm sewer systems, which may be regulated through general permits.28 EPA may delegate NPDES permitting authority to a state, and has done so for Connecticut; as a result, DEEP is the permitting agency for this program. The primary CWA provisions to address pollution from “nonpoint sources” (e.g., runoff) are found in section 319, which requires states to submit to and receive approval from EPA a report identifying waters that are not expected to attain applicable water quality standards and major nonpoint source categories, among other information, and a management program identifying best management practices and measures that will be taken for controlling nonpoint source pollution from those sources, with a focus on watershed approaches.29 EPA grants are available for implementation of approved management programs.30 Other nonpoint source provisions are included in the “areawide waste treatment management” provisions of section 208 of the Act. This section required states to identify areas with substantial water quality control problems “as a result of urban-industrial concentrations and other factors,” designate a regional planning organization for such areas, and develop areawide management plans for controlling pollution in the areas both through improved point source and nonpoint source control and management.31 Subsequent NPDES and section permits were to be consistent with these plans. However, implementation of these provisions was not successful, and EPA no longer issues planning grants for implementation of these requirements.32  Section 404 of the Act requires a permit to discharge dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including wetlands and marine waters.33 Permits are issued by USACE in compliance with guidelines set by EPA through regulations.34 This authority substantially overlaps with Corps jurisdiction under section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, as further discussed below. Discharges may be covered by a state, regional, or nationwide general permit for certain discharges; other discharges require an individual permit or letter of permission from USACE.35 Compensatory mitigation will be required for permits.36 Certain categories of discharges are exempt from permits, including maintenance and emergency reconstruction of dikes, dams, and other coastal infrastructure.37 While states may obtain delegated section 404 permitting authority, Connecticut and most other states have not sought this authority to date.                                                              26 Id. § 1311, 1342. 27 Id. § 1311 (h); 40 C.F.R. § 125.58 (defining terms). 28 40 C.F.R. §§ 122.26, 122.28 29 33 U.S.C. § 1329. 30 Id. 31 Id. § 1288. 32 Envtl.

These activities and the federal requirements for state action related to parks and wildlife are detailed here. 2.1.4.1 National Wildlife Refuges The National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) system was originally created through independent executive actions and legislation rather than through “organic” legislation.43 President Theodore Roosevelt established the first NWR by Executive Order,44 while later refuges have been established by statute. NWR lands have traditionally been used for “wildlife-dependent recreational activities”—primarily, for hunting of waterfowl.

McKinney National Wildlife Refuge.51 The Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge is made up of ten separate units along the southern Connecticut shoreline, four of which are located in the study area, permanently protecting substantial portions of largely undeveloped shoreline that may be an important asset for coastal resiliency:   Outer Island (Branford);  Falkner Island (Guilford);  Milford Point (Milford); and  Great Meadows Marsh (Stratford).52 Work began in 2011 on the scoping process for the comprehensive conservation plan for Stewart B. McKinney NWR. The draft plan remains under development and has not been completed to date.  2.1.4.2 National Estuarine Research Reserves The CZMA established the National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) system, through which NOAA and states partner to engage in stewardship, monitoring, research, training, and education activities under a management plan for designated NERR sites.53 Coastal zone management programs and NERRs are eligible for grants under the program, including for property acquisition.54 Connecticut is one of two eligible jurisdictions that has not established a NERR.                                                              45 Id. at 459; 16 U.S.C. § 668dd. 46 Fischman, supra note 43, at 465. 47 16 U.S.C. § 668dd(a)(2). 48 Id. § 668dd(a)(3) et seq. 49 Id. § 668dd. 50 Id. § 668dd(e). 51 Pub.

SWAPs: are authorized by the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 [] and the Fish and Wildlife Programs Improvement and National Wildlife Refuge System Centennial Act of 2000. An approvable SWAP, which is required for a state to receive project funding under the State Wildlife Grants Program, must meet federal criteria, including identification of the problems that may adversely affect the species or their habitats and a determination of actions to be taken to conserve species and habitats identified in the plan as having the greatest conservation need. SWAPs are often touted as tools for conserving nongame wildlife populations proactively before they exhibit signs of decline.56 Connecticut has developed, and in 2015 revised, an approved SWAP, including an updated list of species of greatest conservation need and ten key habitats, including tidal wetlands.57 2.1.5 Transportation Infrastructure 2.1.5.1 Navigation The US Coast Guard (USCG) administers legislation related to marine safety and security, including the Ports and Waterways Safety Act,58 and certain aspects of the Rivers and Harbors Act.59 USCG has promulgated regulations to implement these authorities, most notably covering aids to navigation requirements. Under these regulations, USCG determines whether structures, sunken vessels, and other obstructions placed by federal or state governments or nongovernmental actors are hazards to navigations; if so, they must be marked.60  USACE implements a range of navigation provisions under federal law. Notably, the Rivers and Harbors Act requires a permit from the Corps to construct any structure in or over navigable waters or for work affecting the course, location, or condition of a water body.61 This authority is implemented jointly with section 404 of the CWA. The CWA also contains additional specific authority related to dredging. When required to comply with the CWA, the Secretary of the Army                                                              55 DEEP, A National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) for Long Island Sound, at http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?a=2705&q=575062 (last visited Aug. 31, 2016). 56 Vicky J.

This provision is directed at priority areas, which do not include Connecticut waters, but it could also be used elsewhere.62  2.1.5.2 Highways  The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is responsible for a wide range of transportation infrastructure, but largely operates as a funding agency for creation of federal-aid highways, transit projects, and other transportation activities. These funding activities will trigger federal environmental review and other associated consultation and review obligations; in some cases, as in airports, DOT agencies will also directly govern how infrastructure is operated.  A Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) must be established for each metropolitan area of more than 50,000 individuals.63 MPOs are required to generate long-range transportation plans (LRTPs) and transportation improvement programs (TIPs) providing for development and management of transportation systems and facilities for the metropolitan area.64 LRTPs must, among other requirements, include a discussion of potential environmental mitigation activities and areas to conduct these activities to restore and maintain environmental functions affected by the plan. TIPs must include priority projects, consistent with the plan, proposed for funding.65 States are additionally directed to create a statewide transportation plan and TIP in coordination with the MPOs.66 Grant funding is provided to states and MPOs for implementation of metropolitan planning and TIP activities, in addition to other funding for transportation infrastructure activities provided to the state.67  DOT has created a climate adaptation plan as required by Executive Order 13514, which identifies key actions for the department, including “actions to ensure that Federal transportation investment decisions address potential climate impacts in statewide and metropolitan transportation planning and project development processes” and work “to incorporate climate variability and change impact considerations in asset management.”68 As a result of the continuing implementation of these priorities, DOT funding may seek consideration of climate resilience in transportation planning in the region, including through green infrastructure approaches. 2.1.6 Shellfish While Long Island Sound lies entirely within state jurisdiction, activities in these waters remain subject to federal jurisdiction and permitting programs.                                                               62 Id. § 1273. 63 23 U.S.C. § 134. 64 Id. 65 Id. 66 Id. § 135. 67 Id. §§ 104, 105. 68 U.S. Dep’t of Transp., Climate Adaptation Plan: Ensuring Transportation Infrastructure and System Resilience, available at https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.dev/files/docs/DOT%20Adaptation%20Plan.pdf (last visited Aug. 31, 2016).

Most notably, the New England District (NAD) of USACE permits these and other activities involving placement of structures on the seabed under section 404 of the CWA and section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (RHA). NAD has issued a General Permit (GP) under both the CWA and RHA authorizing qualifying certain shellfish activities to proceed without an individual letter of permission or permit. Qualifying activities must have no more than minimal direct, secondary and cumulative adverse environmental impacts, cannot unreasonably interfere with navigation, and must comply with a range of additional conditions, including aquaculture-specific conditions. USACE provides a pre-screening form to assist aquaculture project qualification for this GP. In addition, in reviewing GP applications NAD will ensure compliance with and/or carry out required consultations under the ESA, NHPA, EFH provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, and Federal Navigation Projects, among others.  Shellfish production may include placement of a structure in the ocean that requires application to the US Coast Guard for authorization to mark the structure as a private aid to navigation.69 2.2 State Authorities A wide variety of state laws and programs are relevant to coastal resiliency in southern Connecticut. These authorities both create direct requirements for action and delegate certain powers for mandatory or optional action by municipalities. This section reviews these legal authorities. 2.2.1 Requirements for State Actions, Permits, and Licensing The Connecticut Environmental Policy Act70 requires that before taking an action which would have a major impact on a natural resource of the state, a state agency must undergo a review process which generates an Environmental Impact Evaluation,71 which is akin to an environmental impact statement created pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act.72 State agency actions include providing funds and granting a permit.73 The procedure begins with a scoping process, including public comment, to determine relevant environmental concerns.74 Upon determination that a significant impact could potentially exist, the agency circulates a draft environmental impact evaluation to state and local agencies for review and to the public for comment.75 A final evaluation,                                                              69 33 C.F.R. §§ 64.21; 64.06 (defining structure to include any fixed or floating obstruction). 70 Conn.

This section reviews the state laws making and setting the terms of these delegations. 2.2.2.1 Municipal Governance Connecticut law provides for three types of municipalities: towns, cities, and boroughs.77 The town is the basic unit of municipal government and may include within its geographic boundaries a subordinate “political subdivision” in the form of a borough or city government.78 Thus, a borough or city may exist within a town, with some independent self-governance authority. These subdivisions may be consolidated with the town.79  Municipalities obtain their authority and jurisdiction from state law, as directed by the state constitution.80 Municipal authorities may derive from a special act that applies to a single municipality (e.g., a city incorporation act) or from generally applicable state laws.81 The Home Rule Act82 has been the primary source of authority for municipal governance throughout Connecticut since the 1950s and sets out basic municipal powers of self-government. The powers delegated to municipalities under the Home Rule Act are broad and interpreted expansively, 83 but municipal legislation implementing these powers cannot conflict with state law.84 The Home Rule Act authorizes each municipality to adopt a charter to be its “organic law” setting out the structure and operation of its government and which supersede any prior charter or special act established by the state government.85 The charter must create a legislative authority and executive from among several options, and must create the boards and commissions required by law.86 Each municipality in the study area has established a town charter, with varying structures—                                                             76 Id. § 22a-1a-9. 77 Conn.

Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  15 | P a g e   generally, either a town meeting legislature led by selectmen or a town council legislature led by a mayor.87  State law grants municipalities a range of powers under the Home Rule Act (to municipalities with qualifying charters88) and other generally applicable laws. These powers include, among others, the ability to regulate and control town finances and property, public services, public works and utilities (including water and sewer), highways, buildings, and the environment (including protection and improvement of coastal areas, wetlands, and areas adjacent to waterways).89 Municipal governments must use ordinances when exercising these powers to make permanent law,90 which they must publish in a code of ordinances.91  State law authorizes municipalities to establish a variety of boards, commissions, and corporations to carry out specific roles in addition to their general authority to establish municipal departments. These entities generally operate quasi-independently from the municipal government and enjoy specific governmental powers, such as the power to acquire property by condemnation. These are indicated below, as appropriate. 2.2.2.2 Regional Governance The state constitution provides that the assembly may prescribe methods whereby municipalities may establish regional governments and establish compacts among themselves and regional governments, as well as the powers and roles of such regional governments and compacts.92 Two or more municipalities may jointly perform any function that each has the authority to do separately by approval of an agreement by each participant.93 Connecticut has by statute established regional councils of government (COGs) under the authority of OPM, which is authorized to designate planning regions in the state for coordinated planning and regional delivery of state and local services.94 A COG can be established within each planning region by ordinance of 60% or more of the municipalities within the region.95 Each member municipality is represented on the COG by its chief executive or a designee.96 COGs may participate in grant, donation, or other programs available to political subdivisions of the state, including the state grant-in-aid program through the regional planning incentive account,97                                                              87 Additional requirements for the roles and operations of town meetings, selectmen, and other town officers are provided in state law.

Finally, multiple COGs may establish inter-council committees to recommend policies of an inter-regional nature.102 Other regional planning authorities and programs include the following:  OPM is responsible for reviewing regional tax-based revenue sharing programs and establishment of regional asset districts.103  Interlocal agreements: Any municipality or district may enter into an interlocal agreement to provide services for joint use and benefit, and may establish an interlocal advisory board to recommend programs and policies for cooperation or uniform action under the agreement.104 Agreements must contain specific elements, including, for example, dispute resolution provisions, and have the legal status of an interstate compact.105  Municipal and metropolitan districts: Any two or more municipalities may form a district to perform any function which each of the municipalities can perform separately. Municipal districts are governed by boards drawn from each municipality.106 Any “metropolitan area” – defined as a central city of 25,000 or more and any municipality within 15 miles – may join together to form a metropolitan district to perform functions, services, or works that each may perform separately. Metropolitan district member municipalities may adopt a charter for the district providing for a district government.107  Regional economic development commissions: Any two or more municipalities with economic development commissions may by ordinance form a regional commission with the same duties and authority that their member municipal districts enjoy under state law.108                                                              regional level or plans towards such regional services, which may be funded through the regional planning incentive account.

The boundaries of such districts must encompass one or more state planning area.109 Each district must develop a comprehensive economic development strategy containing certain information, which must be submitted to the relevant COG(s) for comment and recommendations and then to ECD and OPM for review and approval.110 Once approved, the district can be designated by the governor and can request federal designation and receive priority grants for economic development.111 Projects in an approved plan are automatically eligible for state bond funding.112 2.2.3 Planning and Zoning Connecticut has, for the most part, delegated planning and zoning to municipalities and regional organizations, as described below. However, Connecticut has established a state POCD as well as a variety of other mandatory plans. The state POCD is the official policy for the executive branch in matters pertaining to land and water resource conservation and development and has been adopted by the legislature.113 Plan revision is under the oversight of OPM,114 which is further authorized to “Formulate and prepare state-wide or interregional plans for the physical, social and economic development of the state” for a variety of issues, including land and water use; transportation; environmental considerations; and housing.115 OPM also has oversight of regional planning in the state, as discussed below. The state POCD must include certain elements, such as greenways system, transportation, and housing, as well as consideration, identification of impacts, and recommendations for infrastructure siting associated with “increased coastal erosion…as anticipated in sea level change scenarios.”116 Once adopted by the legislature, certain actions by state agencies must be consistent with the plan, including acquisition or development of real property or transportation facilities. The plan must also be considered in other plans that must be developed under other state or federal laws.117 The current plan, adopted by the legislature in 2013, applies for the years 2013-18.118                                                               109 Conn.

Regional Framework for Coastal Resilience in Southern Connecticut: Legal, Policy, and Regulatory Assessment  18 | P a g e   In addition to the state POCD, various agencies must create and maintain “major state plans,” with which other activities must be consistent (as described where relevant below).119 Such plans include the:  plan for development of outdoor recreation;120   solid waste management plan;121   state-wide plan for the management of water resources;122   state-wide environmental plan;123   historic preservation plan adopted under the National Historic Preservation Act;124   state-wide facility and capital plan;125   consolidated plan for housing and community development;126   water quality management plan adopted under the federal Clean Water Act;127  plans for managing forest resources;128 and   Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Compact.129  Other plans are also required but may not be defined as “major plans,” including the statewide economic strategic plan.130  2.2.3.1 Municipal Planning and Zoning Connecticut provides a range of authorities governing the municipal planning and zoning process. Municipalities are empowered to create zoning commissions and planning commissions (which are often combined as a planning and zoning commission, or PZC131) by ordinance, which must follow requirements of state law.132 Zoning boards of appeals (ZBAs, equivalently referred to in some jurisdictions as a Board of Zoning Appeal) are required in each municipality with a zoning commission133 The planning commission must establish a POCD at least once every 10 years, which must contain certain elements, and those for municipalities contiguous to Long Island Sound must be:  consistent with municipal coastal program requirements;                                                               119 Conn.

Certain municipal actions must be referred to the commission for a report. Other commission actions include approval of subdivisions (with notice to the regional COG).137  Historic district commissions: Municipalities may establish historic d
