The adoption of the sugarcane biorefinery concept by the sugar industry is a possible solution to improving the sustainability of the industry amid these challenges. In this envisioned biorefinery, multiple products are created within an integrated system that maximises sustainability, as opposed to relying on producing one or very few products. In this study, the potential economic viability of the recovery of biobutanol was explored with the ultimate intention of using this biobutanol as a platform chemical for the production of higher value products to include in the biorefinery’s product portfolio. Biobutanol is produced from biomass via the ABE (acetone, butanol, and ethanol) fermentation process. Biobutanol production is characterised by very low butanol concentrations in the fermentation broth (around 2 wt. %) due to high inhibition, resulting in a very high cost of recovery (distillation) and the need for several downstream purification steps. Following a literature search on technologies that have been proposed and previously implemented for biobutanol production, processes integrating gas stripping and extraction were simulated on Aspen Plus® and techno economic analyses performed to determine the profitability based on cash flows over a 25 year period.  Gas stripping and liquid-liquid extraction experiments were first carried out in order to have a way of validating simulation results. Gas stripping experiments created scenario-based results of the expected butanol concentration in the gas phase once a steady state butanol concentration can be maintained in the fermenter. The extraction experiments were conducted to establish a quick way of evaluating the extractive properties of a solvent based on the distribution coefficients and selectivities with respect to butanol. Five solvents were evaluated including hexyl acetate and diethyl carbonate, which have not been reported on but have been previously applied in biomass processing. Distribution coefficients of 3.57 and 6.15 and selectivities of 367.09 and 396.00, with respect to butanol, were obtained for hexyl acetate and diethyl carbonate, respectively. Four processes were then simulated on Aspen Plus® and they all assumed a fermentation process that make use of 281.67 t/h clear juice from a South African generic sugar mill iv  model. A study estimate type economic evaluation, accurate within ±30% error, was performed with profitability being assessed in terms of the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) over the 25 year period. Process Scheme 1 was the benchmarking case and consists of the conventional series of five distillation columns. For this process a Total Capital Investment (TCI) of US$124.85 million was obtained and based on the sales and production costs a negative NPV of US$3.80 million was obtained. This indicates a non-viable process under the current economic conditions. Process Scheme 2 included in situ recovery by gas stripping and final purification using distillation. Five distillation columns were still required to purify the condensate from the stripper due to a large amount of water that is carried in. The increased productivity in the fermenter and the reduction the downstream column sizes in this process, compared to the benchmarking case, resulted in a reduced capital cost of US$67.43 million. This recovery process also yielded a potential to be profitable with a positive NPV of US$505.88 million and an IRR of 31%. This was attributed to the reduced TCI as well as the ability of the process to yield all the three ABE solvents to sellable purities. Process Scheme 3 that included gas stripping and liquid-liquid extraction had almost the same TCI as Process Scheme 2 (US$68.94 million) but could only yield butanol to sellable quality due to the selective property of the solvent used (2-ethyl-hexanol). This reduction in sales led to an IRR of 6% which is below the discounted rate used (10%) although a positive NPV of US$82.38 million resulted. Process Scheme 4, making use of a two-stage gas stripping and distillation, was the most profitable process and it was concluded it would be the process to attach to the sugar mill model and also to be considered for the higher value chemical production. An NPV of US$524.09 and an IRR of 32% were realised for this process. Sensitivity analyses on these four processes showed that the cost of the substrate (clear juice) and the butanol selling price have the major effects on the profitability. It was, therefore, recommended that other streams from the sugar mill be considered as substrates for higher value chemical products which can attract higher prices than butanol which is regulated by the petro based butanol. Finally, a structure of a functionalised ionic liquid was suggested based on group contribution methods to be a potential reactive extraction reactant for converting butanol to a higher value ester product. v  TABLE OF CONTENTS  Declaration ......................................................................................................................... i Acknowledgements ........................................................................................................... ii Abstract ........................................................................................................................... iii Table Of Contents.............................................................................................................. v List Of Figures ....................................................................................................................ix List Of Tables .....................................................................................................................xi Nomenclature ................................................................................................................. xiv CHAPTER ONE ....................................................................................................................... 1 1.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Biobutanol 1.1.1. Butanol-An Introductory Overview The rate at which fossil reserves are depleting coupled with the volatile crude oil price and environmental concerns like global warming and other geopolitical factors, has prompted the need to look into renewable resources for energy. Biofuels seem to be one of the potential alternative energy sources to substitute fossil-based liquid fuels, and a great deal of research has been conducted especially towards the design and optimisation of production processes. Butanol (butyl alcohol or n-butanol) produced from biomass (biobutanol), is one such potential biofuel to replace the conventional fossil-based fuels. As of the year 2012, the global market for butanol stood at 2.8 million tonnes (Mascal, 2012). The use of butanol as an alternative fuel has shown so much potential as the butanol characteristics are similar to those of gasoline (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012, Abdehagh et al., 2015). It is for this reason that butanol can be blended into gasoline in any proportion and used as fuel without the need to modify the existing car engines (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012). Table 1-1 shows the characteristic properties of butanol when compared to the conventional fuel, gasoline, as well as to ethanol and methanol, which are common alcohol fuels. Additionally, compared to other biofuels, butanol is less volatile (low vapour pressure), less flammable and less corrosive making it safer to work with (Abdehagh et al., 2015). The low vapour pressure increases the ease of transportation through a pipeline (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012, Ha et al., 2010, Harvey and Meylemans, 2011). Butanol also has a low solubility in water (7.7 g/100 mL at 20°C (Abdehagh et al., 2014, Visioli et al., 2  2014)) which reduces the hazard of ground water contamination during pipeline transportation (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012). It is described to be hygroscopic (Ha et al., 2010, Harvey and Meylemans, 2011).  Table 1-1: Comparison of butanol as a fuel Parameter Gasoline Butanol Ethanol Methanol Energy density (MJ/L) 32.5 29.2 19.6 15.6 Air-fuel ratio 14.6 11.2 9 6.5 Heat of vaporisation (MJ/kg) 0.23 0.43 0.92 1.2 Research octane number 91-99 96 129 136 More important than being a biofuel, butanol serves as a source of valuable materials which include: x Solvent in chemical industry (Ishii et al., 1985, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012) as well as for paints, dyes, coatings and varnishes (Wu et al., 2007, Faisal et al., 2014) x Cosurfactant  in micellar flooding (tertiary oil recovery) (Ishii et al., 1985) x C4 feedstock for chemical synthesis (esters, ethers, acetates etc.) (Zverlov et al., 2006, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012). Butanol also makes a suitable platform chemical for further processing to advanced bio-fuels such as butyl levulinate (Kraemer et al., 2011) 1.1.2. Biobutanol Production History, Research and Developments In the first part of the 20th century, acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) production from fermentation using solventogenic clostridia was ranked second only to ethanol (Ni and Sun, 2009, Kraemer et al., 2010). During this period, large commercial plants were in existence in the UK, Canada, France, the USA, Japan, India, China, Australia, South Africa (National Chemical Products in Germiston), Taiwan, Egypt, Brazil and Soviet Union (Zverlov et al., 2006, Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008). After World War 2, ABE fermentation could not compete with the petrochemically derived butanol as the industry was on the rise. Additionally, molasses became scarce particularly in USA where it was used in cattle feed (Jones and Woods, 1986). Between 1950 and 1960 ABE production completely ceased in Europe and North America (Ni and Sun, 2009). In South Africa, the fermentation was operational until 1982 due to the abundant supply of molasses, coal and the import restrictions. However, 3  the plant was forced to close due to shortages of molasses resulting from the severe drought in Southern Africa in early 1980 (Jones and Woods, 1986, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012).  In recent years, focus has been rekindled towards the industrial production of biobutanol. In 2006, BP and DuPont announced a joined venture to develop and commercialise biobutanol. Plans were to produce 30 000 tons biobutanol per year in a modified ethanol plant of British Sugar in the UK (Ni and Sun, 2009). In China, an annual production of biobutanol amounting to 210 000 tons was reported in 2008 and this is expected to reach a million tons in the next few years (Ni and Sun, 2009). Brazil also has some plants that are currently operating.  The conventional biobutanol production suffers from the following challenges that have received a tremendous amount of research attention (Jones and Woods, 1986, Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008, Kraemer et al., 2011, Kumar and Gayen, 2011, Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012):  i. Expensive feedstocks ii. Low productivities (up to 0.6 g/L/h) and butanol yields (ABE yields of 0.3) of ABE fermentation iii. High product inhibition especially by butanol (typically 20 g/L ABE with a mass ratio of 3:6:1) iv. High cost of separation of ABE from dilute fermentation broth in the downstream processes  To address the challenge of cost associated with substrates, research attention has been directed towards making use of cheaper lignocellulosic feedstocks such as agricultural wastes and other energy crops such as switchgrass (a switch from the traditional molasses and corn). This is possible because the microorganisms for biobutanol production can catabolise a wide range of carbohydrates (Zverlov et al., 2006, Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008). The use of waste-type substrates is, however, associated with two challenges, i.e. they are usually not available in a concentrated form, and they may only be available seasonally (Lenz and Morelra, 1980).  Butanol productivity and yield from fermentation processes have been increased by employing continuous fermentation processes (as opposed to the conventional batch process). These continuous processes include the use of cell recycle membrane reactors and 4  immobilized cell reactors or packed bed reactors (Jones and Woods, 1986, Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008).  Microorganism growth inhibition by butanol in fermentation broth is the cause of the low product concentration which in turn requires a large amount of energy to separate and concentrate. Traditionally, distillation is used to recover and separate the products; however, the separation is not economically viable. The cost of separating butanol by a pure distillation downstream process requires more energy than the energy content of butanol (Kraemer et al., 2011). To reduce the product inhibition, hyper butanol-producing strains have been developed. For example, Qureshi and Blaschek (2001a) developed the strain C. beijerinckii BA101 which has been reported to produce up to 33 g/L ABE solvents and a total ABE concentration of 31.3 g/L (19.1 g/L butanol) was reported for C. acetobutylicum JB200 by Xue et al. (2012). However, economic analyses results have indicated that the use of improved fermentation strains alone is not sufficient to attain an economically viable process design, unless combined with cost effective separation processes (Van der Merwe et al., 2013).  In situ recovery of butanol from fermentation broth has received a great deal of research attention and the subject has been extensively investigated. The focus of the research has been towards the development of a suitable method that will both reduce the product inhibition as well as render the product concentration process economically viable. Techniques that have been investigated in detail include: liquid-liquid extraction, adsorption, gas stripping, pervaporation, perstraction (or membrane solvent extraction), reverse osmosis, as well as the use of hybrid processes.  Regardless of all the advances made in the ABE fermentation, product removal from fermentation broth still remains expensive and hinders the industrial production of biobutanol. The high energy cost associated with ABE recovery remains the bottleneck in the industrial production of biobutanol (Kraemer et al., 2010).  1.2. The Sugarcane Biorefinery Concept The Sugar Milling Research Institute NPC (SMRI) aims to ensure sustainability of the sugarcane processing industry in Southern Africa in both the short and long term. It is involved in research work and offers technical services to the industry. In the SMRI annual 5  report for 2014-2015, it is stated that the South African sugar industry is showing signs of decline and there is need for change to ensure the industry still remains viable. One of the solutions to that effect is the adoption of the biorefinery approach, where “multiple products are created within an integrated system that maximises profitability”, as opposed to relying on producing one commodity (SMRI, 2015).  In its most general form, a biorefinery has been defined by the United States (U.S.) National Renewable Energy Laboratory1 as “a facility that integrates conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power and chemicals from biomass”. Often, the biorefinery concept is compared to today’s petroleum refineries where multiple products are produced from petroleum. At this present moment, sugar mills in South Africa can be considered as biorefineries for they use biomass (sugarcane) to produce sugar (sucrose) and molasses as products as well as bagasse which is used as fuel in the sugar mill (Rein, 2007). Some mills go on to use the molasses in the production of ethanol. The envisioned sugarcane biorefinery, however, may also produce a wide range of chemical intermediates (so-called platform chemicals) which represent the feedstocks for other products, in the same way as the production of bulk chemicals in an oil refinery.  The following are the advantages of a biorefinery (and hence, a sugarcane biorefinery) as compared to facilities that produce a single product (Lynd et al., 2005, Rein, 2007): x It is possible to vary a mix of products to maximise revenue in the face of dynamic market conditions x The selling price of the primary product can be significantly lowered by coproducing higher value, lower volume products x There are integration benefits associated with coproduction e.g. making use of electricity and steam cogenerated from process residues x Value generated from feedstock (biomass) is maximised in a biorefinery by making use of all the component fractions of biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin etc.)                                                          1 Homepage National Renewable Energy Laboratory, http:\\\\www.nrel.gov/biomass/biorefinery.html, last accessed 28 June 2016 6  To increase the profitability and long term value of the (sugarcane) biorefinery, it is important to analyse a mix of high and low profit margin products and optimise the production capacities (Geraili et al., 2014).  1.3. Ionic Liquids and the Role of Green Chemistry in the Sugarcane Biorefinery In order to turn the sugar industry in South Africa into a sustainable sugarcane biorefinery, it is important to ensure that the additional materials and chemicals that are being produced are based on green and sustainable supply chains.  The application of green chemistry in the development of the sugarcane (or any other biomass) biorefinery offers an opportunity for the protection of the environment while meeting the needs of society.  By definition, green chemistry can be considered “as a set of principles for the manufacture and application of products that aim to eliminate the use, or generation, of environmentally harmful and hazardous chemicals” (H Clark et al., 2009).   Therefore, in combining green chemistry with a biorefinery, the ultimate task is to produce genuinely green and sustainable chemical products (H Clark et al., 2009, Cherubini, 2010). Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that exist as liquids at low temperature (<100°C) and one of their most significant properties is their extremely low vapour pressure (Zhao et al., 2005, Ha et al., 2010). Although there is some level of debate, due to their negligible vapour pressure, ILs are generally regarded as ‘green’ solvents compared to the traditions volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (Earle and Seddon, 2000, Zhao et al., 2005). This combined with the fact that ILs can be designed and tuned to exhibit specific properties makes ILs an excellent resource in the sugarcane biorefinery as solvents, catalysts and in synthesis trails while producing materials and chemicals in a sustainable way.  1.4. Research Questions, Aims and Objectives 1.4.1. Project Aims and Objectives The main objective of this study is to economically recover and concentrate butanol from the fermentation of sugars for the South African sugar industry. This is in line with supporting the South African sugar industry to adopt the sugarcane biorefinery concept. Butanol has the potential to become a platform intermediate for other chemicals. Options that could be considered include reacting butanol with an acid to produce high value ester 7  products, or reacting it with carbon dioxide, in the presence of a catalyst, to produce dibutyl carbonate.  To achieve the aim above, the following objectives have to be met: 1. Develop a scheme (process) that recovers and concentrates butanol from fermentation broth 2. Determine the profitability of the developed separation process based on the recoveries from the broth, capital and operating costs as well the energy performances  3. Determine the main factors that affect the profitability of the process and how that impacts on the decisions to be made in the context of the sugarcane biorefinery 4. Explore possible routes for the sustainable conversion of biobutanol into higher value products that can potentially be included in the mix of products in the sugarcane biorefinery              8  1.4.2.

LITERATURE SURVEY A number of reviews have been compiled describing butanol production by fermentation. These reviews cover areas like the production history, process conditions, the different substrates used, microorganisms, the process biochemistry, metabolism as well as the separation techniques that have been employed. Also covered are the improvements that have been achieved to make the conventional industrial process economically viable. Although a summary of all these aspects is also provided in this current review, emphasis has been placed on the product recovery and concentration techniques from a process engineering point of view. For additional information on the other aspects, the reader is referred to reviews by the following authors; Jones and Woods (1986), Qureshi and Ezeji (2008), Lee et al. (2008), Kumar and Gayen (2011) and Ranjan and Moholkar (2012). 2.1. Fermentative Butanol Production The fermentation process to produce butanol is termed ‘ABE fermentation’ based on the major products which are acetone (A), butanol (B) and ethanol (E), with butanol being the major product of the three (Roffler et al., 1988). The ratio acetone:butanol:ethanol is typically 3:6:1, by weight (Abdehagh et al., 2013). ABE fermentation is sometimes also referred to as solvent fermentation (Qureshi et al., 2005). The term ‘biobutanol’ is often employed to specifically refer to butanol produced from biomass by fermentation-a biological process as opposed to ‘petrobutanol’ obtained from fossil resources via the oxo process (Lee et al., 2008, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012, Van der Merwe et al., 2013).  The following are the major reactions involved in the glucose fermentation by Clostridia cultures (Wu et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2009): 10  𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 +  𝐻2𝑂 →  𝐶3𝐻6𝑂(𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑒) + 3𝐶𝑂2 + 4𝐻2                             [2-1] 𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 →  𝐶4𝐻10𝑂(𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙) + 2𝐶𝑂2 + 𝐻2𝑂                              [2-2] 𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 →  2𝐶2𝐻6𝑂(𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙) + 2𝐶𝑂2                               [2-3] 𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 →  𝐶4𝐻8𝑂2 (𝑏𝑢𝑡𝑦𝑟𝑖𝑐 𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑) + 2𝐶𝑂2 + 2𝐻2                                                                [2-4] 𝐶6𝐻12𝑂6 →  3𝐶2𝐻4𝑂2 (𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑐 𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑑)                                            [2-5] 2.1.1. Microorganisms and Substrates for ABE Fermentation The selection of the bacterial strains that are used in the production of biobutanol is dependent on the nature of the substrate, targeted productivity, the required relative concentration of the products, butanol tolerance as well as the need for additional nutrients (Jones and Woods, 1986, Kumar and Gayen, 2011). There are various microbial cultures that have been used to produce biobutanol but the most widely used are Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium beijerinckii (Harvey and Meylemans, 2011), under anaerobic conditions. Clostridium acetobutylicum remains the best studied and most manipulated strain (Kumar and Gayen, 2011). These microorganisms have also been described as ‘anaerobic solventogenic clostridia’ (Kumar and Gayen, 2011, Abdehagh et al., 2013). The advantage of using these bacteria (or any other butanol-producing culture) is that they can utilise a wide variety of carbohydrates (e.g. cellbiose, sucrose, glucose, fructose, xylose etc.) (Zverlov et al., 2006, Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008) which is not possible for the traditional yeast that is used in ethanol production (Kraemer et al., 2011). There are two phases that characterise the ABE fermentation by clostridial cultures, i.e. an acid production phase (acidogenesis) and a solvent production phase (solventogenesis)2. During the acidogenic phase, the pH of the fermentation broth drops from around 6.8-7 to between 4.5 and 5. During this phase, there is rapid cell growth and the secretion of the carboxylic acids, acetate, and butyrate (Kumar and Gayen, 2011, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012, Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012). At the final stage of the acidogenesis phase, acid production slows down due to effect of low pH. Organisms shift their metabolic activity to                                                         2 It should be noted that traditionally, ABE fermentation aimed at producing acetone, butanol and ethanol to be used as solvents, and hence this specific application lead to the usage of the somewhat ambiguous terms “solventogenesis” and “solvent fermentation”. 11  the solventogenesis phase where the acetate and butyrate are consumed as substrates for the biosynthesis of acetone and butanol, while no growth is observed. AcetoneButanolEthanolAcetateButyratePyruvateSubstrateFermentation Acidogenesis Solventogenesis Figure 2-1: Phases of the ABE fermentation process (Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008) Substrates that have been commonly considered for clostridia cultures include fibrous biomass containing hemicellulose and cellulose (e.g. wheat straw, rice straw); starchy biomass (such as ground corn and whey permeate); and fruits and vegetables containing fructose, glucose and xylose as basic components (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012). However, the conventional substrates have been molasses, corn, wheat, millet and rye (Jones and Woods, 1986). In as much as Clostridia bacteria can ferment lignocellulosic material, acidic or enzymatic hydrolysis is essential to convert them into monosaccharides before using them as substrates in ABE fermentation (Kumar and Gayen, 2011). However, research is currently still in its infancy regarding the efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulose followed by fermentation. Depending on the raw material (substrates) they are utilising, biorefineries can be classified into first generation and second generation biorefineries. In the first generation biorefineries, raw materials are sugar (sucrose) and cereal grains (starch) while for the second generation biorefineries, lignocellulosic materials (e.g. agriculture and forest wastes) are used as feedstocks. It is important to note that first generation feeds are food competitive while second generation feeds make use of non-edible biomass which are 12  cheaper and more readily available (Kumar and Gayen, 2011). In addition to the competition between food and fuel or chemical production, the production in first generation biorefineries may also lead to problems like deforestation by overuse of lands as well as the environmental risks associated with the use of fertilisers and pesticides (Geraili et al., 2014).  2.1.2. Conventional Industrial Process Just like any other established fermentation process, the fermentative biobutanol production generally consists of the following six stages (Stanbury et al., 2013): i. The formulation of the media to be used in culturing the process organism during the development of the inoculum and in the production fermenter.  ii. The sterilization of the medium, fermenters and ancillary equipment. iii. The production of an active, pure culture in sufficient quantity to inoculate the production vessel.  iv. The growth of the organism in the production fermenter under optimum conditions for product formation. v. The extraction of the product and its purification. vi. The disposal of the effluents produced by the process.  Traditionally, the ABE fermentation was carried out in non-agitated batch fermenters with a capacity of 50 000 to 200 000 gallons (189 to 757 m3). The product was recovered and concentrated by downstream distillation. The initial industrial process made use of maize mash (8 to 10%) which was first cooked for 60 to 90 min at 130 to 133°C. From the mid-30’s going onwards molasses was used as the fermentation substrate. The molasses had to be cooked and sterilized at 107 to 120°C for 15 to 60 min and other sources of organic and inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and a buffering agent were added (Jones and Woods, 1986, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012).  Typically, the batch fermentation system was initiated with a substrate concentration of around 60 g/L (glucose equivalent). The sterilized medium containing the substrate and nutrients is cooled under a blanket of oxygen-free nitrogen or carbon dioxide. Upon cooling, the fermenter reactor is inoculated with a Clostridium culture and fermentation started (Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012, Roffler et al., 1987). Temperatures between 30 and 40 °C 13  have been reported to be optimum for the fermentation (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012). Depending on the culture and substrate used, after a fermentation time of typically 36-72 hrs, ABE of up to 15-20 g/L (ratio usually 3:6:1) have accumulated.  In traditional butanol fermentation facilities, a series of five distillation columns was used to separate and purify the ABE solvents (Roffler et al., 1987, Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012, Van der Merwe et al., 2013), with the last 2 columns solely designed to separate butanol from water (Figure 2-2).  Figure 2-2: Conventional downstream distillation (Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012) C1 beer stripper, C2 acetone column, C3 ethanol column, C4 water column, C5 butanol column, D decanter The separation of the butanol-water system is rendered complex by the existence of an azeotrope at a concentration 55.5 wt. % butanol at 101.3kPa. The azeotrope occurs above the solubility limit (7.7 wt% butanol) and thus, two liquid phases form, i.e. an upper phase containing 79.9 wt. % butanol and a lower phase containing 7.7 wt. % butanol are formed (Vane, 2008, Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012, Visioli et al., 2014). The lower phase boils at lower temperatures (Visioli et al., 2014). This phase separation enables the heterogeneous 14  azeotrope to be separated by using a two distillation column system coupled with a decanter. The top streams from the water and butanol columns are fed into a decanter. After butanol phase separation in the decanter, the water-rich phase is refluxed to the water column while the butanol-rich phase is refluxed to the butanol column. Typically, the bottom product (water) from the water column contains less than 0.1 wt% butanol while the bottom product (butanol) from the butanol column is approximately 99.9 wt% butanol (Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012, Van der Merwe et al., 2013).  2.2. Developments and Improvements to the Conventional Process 2.2.1. Fed-batch Fermentation Process In the fed-batch configuration, the process begins as a batch process with a relatively low substrate concentration and low volume. This mode is applied when a high substrate concentration is toxic to the microbial culture. As the substrate is being consumed, additional substrate is added at a slow rate being careful to keep the ABE concentration below the toxic level (Ezeji et al., 2004, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012). Since butanol is also toxic to the culture, the fed-batch mode is to be coupled with a product-removal technique. Applying the fed-batch configuration together with a product-removal technique, therefore, solves two toxicity problems-substrate inhibition and butanol inhibition (Ezeji et al., 2004). The fed-batch fermentation configuration coupled with in situ gas stripping has been applied resulting in solvent productivities increases of up to 400% (Ezeji et al., 2004, Xue et al., 2012).  2.2.2. Continuous Fermentation Processes Volumetric ABE productivity (g ABE/L fermentation broth/hr) is of major impact on the capital cost as it determines the size of the fermenters required. For instance, if productivity is doubled, capital expenditure can be reduced by approximately by 20%, coupled with some reductions in the operating costs (Green, 2011).  Continuous fermentation processes are applied with the view to increase the reactor productivity which, however, is partly compensated by the relatively low butanol concentration when compared to the batch 15  process  (Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012, Visioli et al., 2014). In China, there is a semi-continuous fermentation process which offers a 40% higher productivity than a conventional batch process (Ni and Sun, 2009). In continuous fermentations, concentrated sugar solutions can be used, product inhibition is reduced by integrated product removal and the cost of waste water treatment is reduced (Kraemer et al., 2011). There is also a reduction in the sterilization and inoculation time (Visioli et al., 2014).  The low productivity associated with the batch process (up to 0.6 g/L/h) is a consequence of various reasons which include the low cell concentration, down time and well as product inhibition. Cell concentrations in batch reactors are typically less than 4 g/L (Ezeji et al., 2007, Mariano and Maciel Filho, 2012). To increase the cell concentration, two techniques, namely ‘immobilization’ and ‘cell recycle’ have been reported.  2.2.2.1 Free Cell Continuous Fermentation Free cell continuous fermentation is characterised by cells that are free to move within the fermentation broth due to agitation by a mechanically operated agitator or by air lifting (Kumar and Gayen, 2011). The microbial culture and nutrients are maintained in suspension and this aids in improving the mass transfer. The disadvantage of the continuous free cell fermentation is that high cell concentrations cannot be achieved and there is possible cell washout at high dilutions since there is no means to retain cells in the reactor (Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008).   Figure 2-3:Free cell continuous reactor (Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008) 2.2.2.2 Immobilized and Cell Recycle Continuous Bioreactors Immobilization serves to retain the microbial cells within the vessel. There is physical retention of the cells in the matrix which can be implemented in packed bed reactors as 16  shown in Figure 2-4 or fluidized type reactors. The lack of mechanical agitation in these reactors allows for long survival time of cells (Kumar and Gayen, 2011). Immobilization is, however, associated with mass transport limitations of substrate and products as well as activity loss due to immobilization. Additionally, there can be accumulation of fermentation gases within the matrix which reduce the productivity as the cells might not be in good contact with the substrate (Jones and Woods, 1986).   Figure 2-4: Immobilised cell packed bed reactor (Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008) In as much as immobilized cell reactors increase the cell concentration inside the bioreactor, cell recycle membranes and filters also serve to increase cell concentration.  As shown in Figure 2-5, a membrane or filter is used to prevent the cells from being removed from the broth with the out flow. Disadvantages of this scheme include: the possible fouling of the membrane with the fermentation broth as well as the high membrane cost (Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008).   Figure 2-5: Membrane cell recycle reactor (Qureshi and Ezeji, 2008) 17  2.3. Biobutanol Inhibition and Recovery Techniques Butanol, which is the major product of the ABE fermentation process, is toxic to microorganisms (Abdehagh et al., 2015) and inhibits the further ABE production at butanol concentrations above 10-15 g/L (Roffler et al., 1988, Ha et al., 2010, Abdehagh et al., 2015).  As a result, the maximum attainable ABE concentration is about 20 g/L (Ishii et al., 1985) as the fermentation is brought to a halt.  Roffler et al. (1988) summarises how butanol inhibition affects the economics of the ABE fermentation process as follows: 1. Fermenter productivity is lowered as butanol accumulates in the broth. This results in the need for larger fermenters. 2. The amount of substrates (sugars or saccharides) that can be consumed is reduced by the butanol inhibition. In traditional batch fermentation, sugar solutions of concentrations higher than 60 g/L cannot be used (Qureshi et al., 2005, Ranjan and Moholkar, 2012, Ishii et al., 1985, Ezeji et al., 2003). High sugar concentrations also come with feed inhibition effects. 3. It is expensive to recover the product by direct distillation due to the low final butanol concentration in the fermenter. There is need to remove large volumes of water during the recovery process because water has a lower boiling point than butanol (Qureshi and Blaschek, 2001b)-butanol boils at 117.7 °C. To curb the inhibition effects of the butanol, there are two main solutions that have received research attention, i.e. to genetically modify the fermentation microorganisms such that they become
