Economic resilience and environmental performance of dairy farms in the upper Waikato region. A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science at The University of Waikato By Alison Mary Dewes 2014   ii    iii  Abstract Dairy farming has impacts on receiving water bodies that have increased in New Zealand during the past two decades due to the intensification and expansion of the industry. As a result the industry has implemented a number of voluntary initiatives to address its environmental impacts. However, declining ecosystem health in the Waikato region means that these initiatives alone are unlikely to retard further decline. Farm system reconfiguration will be required to reduce diffuse nutrient, sediment and pathogen losses. This change will have to occur without significant disruption to farm profit and economic viability. To date most studies have considered single mitigations and the cost of change associated with each. The common notion held by farmers and industry is that if they are constrained by nitrogen leaching caps, business will become less viable. This study examined economic and environmental performance of 25 dairy farms in the Upper Waikato region. There were two components of the study: (1) the development of an environmental scorecard in order to quantify the risk to the receiving environment and (2) identification of relationships between environmental footprint based primarily on nitrogen (N) loss and economic resilience using Return on Capital (ROC) at a range of milk prices. I hypothesised that some farm configurations may result in lower environmental risk concurrently while demonstrating  greater economic resilience. The participant group farmed in the Upper Waikato Catchment between Broadlands and Atiamuri on predominantly pumice soils where annual rainfall ranges from 1000 to 1350 mm. Overseer Version 6.0 was used to determine the nitrogen leaching from each of the farms, as a key measure of environmental performance. Nitrogen leached ranged from 15 to 48 kg N ha-1, with an average of 31.8 kg N ha-1. Low-risk farms were selected on the basis of leaching less than 30 kg N ha-1 y-1, as well as achieving a “low risk score” on the environmental scorecard. “Nutrient use efficiency” for the study farms ranged widely, from 18 to 60 kg milk solids (MS) kg-1 N leached ha-1, with an average of 39 kg MS kg-1 N leached ha-1.  A range of agri-environmental indicators (AEIs) were selected to develop the scorecard to provide a comprehensive measure of the environmental risk associated with different farm management approaches. The AEIs were selected  iv  on the basis they were scientifically sound, quantifiable, referred to issues relevant at catchment scale, were acceptable to target groups, easy to interpret, and cost effective.  Return on capital (ROC) was examined for the low-risk farms under a range of milk price scenarios, to test their economic resilience. Over two years (2010/11 and 2011/12) milk prices varied by ± 20%, and total pasture consumption altered by 10-30% due to seasonal effects. Profitability (ROC) for the 25 farms ranged from 2.5 to 9% at a $6.08 kg-1 MS and N losses from 15-48 kg ha-1 y-1 with an average of 31.8 kg N ha-1 year-1.  Pasture consumed per hectare ranged from 9.3 to 13 t DM ha.-1   the study included three irrigated farms. The irrigated farms yielded an average of 20% more feed each year than the non- irrigated farms while the nitrogen lost from the irrigated farms was almost double that of the non- irrigated farms. To assess how management regimes influenced both nitrogen leaching and profitability, key economic, efficiency and risk parameters were analysed using a regression of ROC on other variables such as stocking rate, milk production and pasture harvested. Twenty-two farms were suitable for this analysis. The only significant factor (p < 0.05) underpinning ROC was a low cost of production (R2 =0.81). For milk prices of $5.50 to $6.08 kg-1 MS, the more profitable farms also had a higher tonnage of pasture consumed per cow. This correlation was not apparent at a higher milk price ($7.50 kg-1 MS), suggesting that more intensive systems (less pasture and more  imported supplement per cow) can be profitable at times of high milk prices as long as feed costs are well managed. Milk prices have averaged $6.30 kg-1 MS over the period of 1995-2014 and in recent years have fluctuated by 25-30% between seasons, suggesting that farming systems will have to adjust their systems quite quickly to adjust to downside risks.  Resilience as it relates to dairy farming includes provision for unexpected events and accounts for volatility of feed, milk price and seasons. This study reinforced that the more intensive dairy systems carry more cow bodyweight per hectare, are dependent on more bought in feed, and can perform comparatively strongly in years of high milk price. These systems can also be more vulnerable, however, with increased environmental risk requiring advanced mitigation strategies such  v  as herd homes, stand- off facilities, supplementary feeding infrastructure and advanced effluent management systems. They also require greater capital investment that can lead to increased debt, compounding business risk.  Agricultural “growth agendas” have been based on the notion that policy approaches will not curb development and will provide more production contributing to a higher national GDP. New farm systems will have to demonstrate high resource use efficiency, minimal environmental risk and robust economic performance to endure in what will be more challenging and volatile conditions.                 vi  Acknowledgements There are many people who have influenced the production of this MSc thesis. Firstly I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor David Hamilton, who patiently encouraged me and guided me with leading edge knowledge throughout the process, and for his teaching in freshwater ecology. The “Tomorrow’s Farms Today” project was made possible through funding from the Sustainable Farming Fund. This project would not have been possible without 26 Reporoa farming families - the most important people in this project. Thanks to the Tomorrow’s Farms Today steering group who in 2010 asked the key question in 2010: “Which farm systems are the most economically resilient with the lowest footprint?” The steering group comprised Ian Bell, Ben Lee, Phil Butler, Rhys Bullock, Alan Wills, Euan Mc Knight. I greatly appreciated their patience, attention to detail in their businesses and ability to provide sound information for analysis for the project. I also especially wish to remember three of the participants who passed away suddenly during the course of the study. Kevin Fitzgerald proudly showed me his wetland restoration, protected waterways and responsible farming practices. Ian Rushbrooke tried his very best to improve his farm’s performance in the two years he was involved, and achieved a lot in a short space of time in reducing his farming footprint. Dolphy Mathis loved his cows so much he built them a shelter, showcasing a farm that demonstrated optimal profit and minimal footprint during the study, managed brilliantly by Mike and Lisa Parnwell. Technical support for this project was far reaching and immense, and from a large array of people, who were all enthusiastic and curious about “what separates the best from the rest” when it comes to identifying resilient farming systems that operate with a low impact on the environment. I am hugely grateful to our Headlands team who worked incredibly hard and in many cases, beyond their call of duty to assist me: Jesse Bolt and Rachel Mudge assisted with robust data collection, and Alanah Bunyard, Brenna Barber and Joe Edlin diligently analysed the financial and in some cases environmental performance provided for my study. Thanks also for regional details and common sense always forthcoming from my veterinary colleagues; Darren Florence and Dan Sullivan at VetPlus in  vii  Reporoa. Thanks to Ballance and Ravensdown reps, who also were very supportive of the study and helped work with farmers for details when required. At a technical level on freshwater ecology, I wish to thank Associate Professor Russell Death from Massey University. He patiently and consistently supported me in understanding complex science around land use and water quality. I have immense appreciation also of Professor Keith Woodford from Lincoln University who made time amidst his incredibly busy schedule to patiently work through the farm system data with me, identifying factors that were statistically important and relevant. Also, I owe a huge thank you to Harold Henderson from AgResearch, an expert statistician, who patiently scrutinised my work on the regression analysis. I am also extremely grateful to Barrie Ridler, retired Senior Lecturer from the Agricultural Economics and Farm Management Department, Massey University, and Roy McCallum from Grazing Systems Limited, both experienced farm systems’ thinkers and modellers, who provided valuable critique and encouragement that I needed most at the end.  Most of all I want to thank my family: my husband and friend, Mike, who encouraged me during the whole course of this extended masters study, while we navigated the challenge of settling back in New Zealand, with our children, Catherine, Hannah and Henri, after 14 years of farming in Australia. They have all have demonstrated extreme patience with me while I have spent numerous weekends and holidays trying to juggle study, developing new business and running a busy family home. I am eternally grateful for that. Thank you finally to my parents and all my older sisters and mentors who have constantly encouraged me to do my best, to conceptualise present and future impacts of our actions, and to work synergistically alongside  and within the boundaries of nature. Most of all I want to thank my inspirational and unique parents, Harry and Peg Dewes, who provided their family with a quest for knowledge, immense curiosity and always strongly encouraged us all to “just do the right thing.”      viii  Table of Contents Chapter 1       : General Introduction………………………………………………1 1.1 International Context

This doubling will result from a projected 2.4-fold increase in per capita real income and a shift to more protein consumption, (Tilman, 2002). New incentives and policies for ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and ecosystem services will be crucial to meet food demands improve crop yields and not compromise environmental integrity or public health. (Tilman, 2002). This study assesses what dairy farms are the most economically resilient and pose the lowest risk to the receiving environment in the Upper Waikato region of New Zealand (NZ).  It will be necessary for agricultural systems to adapt to national and regional political regimes to limit diffuse pollution.  Across NZ, water quality is particularly poor in lowland stream and river catchments dominated by pasture, (Larned et al, 2004). Many lowland rivers are unsuitable for swimming due to faecal contamination from farm animals, poor water clarity, and nuisance algal growths caused by excessive nutrients (eutrophication), (PCE, 2004 and 2013; Larned et al, 2004; Ballantine 2010, 2013). The increasing human demands placed on the water supply threaten biodiversity and the supply for food production and other vital human needs.  Agriculture accounts for approximately 90% of freshwater withdrawn each year, 70% of this is used, and the unused withdrawal is returned to aquatic ecosystems usually of lower quality, (UNESCO, 2001) (OECD, 2013). Presently around one quarter of the global water footprint is attributable to meat and dairy production, (Hoekstra, 2012).  The global human population has now exceeded 7 billion people and estimated 25-30 billion food animals are required to help feed this populations growing demand. This is a global challenge: agricultural development is causing widespread impacts on both the availability of water and water quality in the United States, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere, (Pimentel et al 2004; Brodie, 2005), and more recently in NZ, (P.C.E 2013).   2  It has been widely recognised that anthropogenic nutrient inputs to aquatic ecosystems must be reduced to protect drinking water,  reduce eutrophication and harmful algal blooms, (Huisman et al, 2005), and dead zones in coastal marine ecosystems has been widely recognized, (Conley et al, 2009).  Which particular nutrient is responsible for eutrophication, has been the subject of significant debate.  In the early 1970s Schindler and colleagues showed that phosphorus (P) was the primary limiting nutrient in elegant experimental manipulations of whole lakes (Schindler, 1977).  This paradigm of P limitation in freshwater systems has been persistent since the early 1970s but more recent work has questioned this. Estuaries and coastal marine ecosystems that have been heavily loaded with nutrients can display P limitation, N limitation, and co-limitation (Conley et al, 1999).  The nutrient that is most limiting to primary production can change both seasonally and spatially (Malone et al, 1996). Furthermore, with increasing loading of N relative to P as a result of intensive agricultural practices, phytoplankton in the plume of the Mississippi River entering the Gulf of Mexico has been shown to be periodically limited by P, especially during the spring bloom period (Sylvan et al, 2007). However, implementing only P reductions without reducing N loads could displace the dead zone westward and increase its size (Scavia et al, 2007).  Nitrate nitrogen (NO3–N) typically comprises the majority of the total nitrogen pool in rivers and is a form of dissolved nitrogen that is readily used by primary producers such as periphyton. It has long been recognised that increased nitrate concentrations can cause ecological decline due to eutrophication, at concentrations that are much lower than those at which toxic effects occur (Carmago, 2006; Abell, 2013). Heathwaite ( 2000) and Elser (2007) suggest the diversity of habitat-specific climatic, edaphic and ecological influences on N and P availability makes it difficult to obtain a broad picture of the relative importance of N and P limitation in the biosphere. They note that some existing paradigms identify N as the primary limiting nutrient in terrestrial (Vitousek, 1991 ) and marine (Howarth, 2006) ecosystems and P as the main limiting nutrient in lakes (Schindler, 1977). A meta – analysis by Elser (2007) concluded that enrichment by either N or P can  3  increase autotroph production but that a simultaneous increase in both nutrients leads to dramatically higher levels of production in nearly all situations.  Nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations are influenced by season, flow characteristics, differences in factors such as land management practices between sites, and plant uptake of available nutrients (from substrate or water). Therefore, such variability means that relying on the control of phosphorus alone, while allowing nitrogen to reach levels at which it saturates plant growth or is toxic is fraught with risk because the strategy relies on the assumption that phosphorus concentrations can be continuously maintained at very low concentrations with zero tolerance for occasional elevated concentrations. (Death, 2013, Abell J. , 2013, Joy, 2013: PCE Report 2013). Changes in land use, creation and operation of large terrestrial and marine food production units and microbial and chemical pollution of land and water sources have created new threats to the health of both animals and humans. Over the past 3 decades, approximately 75% of new human infectious diseases have been identified as zoonotic in origin. (Taylor 2001, Daszak, 2004) Faecal microbial pollution from agriculture is an emerging issue. Faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) are commonly used as a proxy of pollution of public health significance. Health protection, as indexed by FIO control, is a central aim of new ‘catchment-scale’ water quality management required in the USA by the Clean Water Act and in the European Union (EU) by the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Experience of the former, after a decade of implementation, suggests that the most significant reason for water quality ‘impairment’ is elevated FIO concentrations, mainly in recreational and shellfish harvesting waters. This provides an early warning of possible problems which the EU regulatory authorities are likely to face, (Kay, 2008). OECD, (2012) highlights the key challenge for policy makers in addressing water quality issues in agriculture is to reduce farm contaminant losses to water systems thereby helping to conserve a range of benefits associated with water systems i.e. recreational use. Water pollutants from agriculture are recognised as nutrients, pesticides, soil sediments, pathogens and now more focus is being given to new  4  and emerging water pollutants arising from agriculture such as veterinary medicines and feed additives. OECD (2012) notes that control diffuse source agricultural pollution is more complicated than addressing point sources of pollution as they are difficult to measure, generally cumulative in their impact, leach form large areas, are highly variable in space and time and also require agreement and co-operation across sub catchments and catchments; (OECD, 2012)  The Water Framework Directive (WFD) was established by European Parliament & Council and came into force on 22 Dec 2000. The  EU Nitrates directive (1991) aims to protect water quality across Europe by preventing nitrates from agricultural sources polluting ground and surface waters and by promoting the use of good farming practices. It is proving effective: between 2004 and 2007, nitrate concentrations in surface water remained stable or fell at 70% of monitored sites. Quality at 66% of groundwater monitoring sites was stable or improving. All member states have drawn up action programmes and there are more than 300 of these across the EU. Close to 40% of all territory across member states is subject to the implementation of action programmes.  The WFD implementation is supported by the principles of the river basin management planning approach and eco hydrological principles (interactions between water and ecosystems), (Zalewski, 2010), which are designed to support member states protect and maintain good ecological status for the water bodies within their river basin districts. Identifying ways to remove point source and diffuse pollution are critical parts of these plans. (Dunbar, 2001. Zalewski.M, 2004. Allen, 2012). Early European water legislation began with standards for abstractions, and in 1980 setting targets for drinking water. It also included quality objective legislation on water for fisheries, shellfish waters, bathing waters and ground waters. In 1988 a second phase of legislative improvements was made, and this resulted in a second phase of water legislation implementation 1991 (European Union Directive: European Parliament & Council, 2000).  This included an Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, The Nitrates Directive, a new Drinking Water Directive, and a Directive for Integrated Pollution and Prevention Control (IPCC). Policy responses in the past in Europe have typically  5  used a mix of economic incentives (taxes and subsidies), environmental regulations, and farm advice and education. This has had mixed results however and policies have generally fallen short of requirements to meet water quality policy goals in agriculture, based on the reports recent OECD country experiences. (OECD, 2012). In reviewing the effectiveness of policies, a number of recommendations were forthcoming (OECD, 2012). These included a mix of policy instruments to address water pollution, such as compliance with existing water quality regulations and standards, polluter pays principle to fund enforcement, and removing perverse support in agriculture to lower pressure on water systems.  Water management in the US is managed by the United States Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) underpinned by an overarching science management framework called “WATERS” Watershed Assessment, Tracking and Environmental Results System. The EPA gathers water quality information to address public concerns such as the health of the watershed, provision of potable water, edible fish and swimmable waterways, (US EPA, 2013).  Water quality assessments are made at a national level using the TMDL assessment. This programme works on several projects at a time across the state in fresh and salt water. The TMDL refers to the pollutant reductions a water body needs to meet the state’s water quality standards. TMDL’s include a strategy to implement those reductions in order to restore water quality. Identification of a problem pollutant occurs, then water quality goals are established, then a specific load (TMDL) allocation is assigned to each of the sources (this is based on the assimilative capacity of the water body). Monitoring ensures standards are met, (US EPA, 2013).  The most critical problems faced by this authority in order of priority are: pathogens – (notably faecal coliform and protozoa), metals, nutrients, organic enrichment and sediment. 1.2 National Context: New Zealand In NZ the responsibility for environmental monitoring and management lies with the Ministry for the Environment. Reliable national scale information is important for setting national environmental policy. New Zealand’s national environmental reporting programme uses 22 core environmental indicators, comprising 66  6  national datasets to measure and report on the health of the NZ environment and track changes over time (Ministry for the Environment, 2013). There are also the Environmental Report Cards: these are regular web-based reports to provide updates on environmental data. They cover the domains of air, atmosphere, energy, fresh water, household consumption, land, oceans, road transport and waste. (Ministry for the Environment, 2013) Five national environmental indicators are used to report regularly on the status of freshwater. River, lake, groundwater, recreational water quality, and freshwater demand are the key indicators reported on nationally. A major challenge to water quality is the pressure being exerted by both the expansion and intensification of farming, especially dairy farming, (P.C.E 2004 and 2013). Dairying has expanded significantly in NZ the past two decades. The national dairy herd increased by approximately 82 per cent between 1980 and 2009, to nearly six million cows. This intensification has contributed to the decline of several essential ecosystem services including the provision of good-quality freshwater, (Abell, 2011). Many rivers draining farmland are unsuitable for swimming because of faecal contamination from farm animals, poor water clarity, and nuisance algal growths caused by excess nutrients. (Ballantine et al, 2010; Larned et al, 2004;  P.C.E Report, 2004 and 2013). Furthermore, the groundwater quality in aquifers that exist under pastoral farming areas, particularly dairying areas, tend to have elevated nitrate and pathogen concentrations with an increasing number of sites breaching drinking water standards, (PCE, 2004 and 2013). The expansion and intensification of pastoral farming has largely occurred  more marginal landscapes placing pressure not only on water and soil resources but also native biodiversity, (Macleod, 2006; Alibone, 2010; Baskaran, 2010; Carrick, 2013). Intensification of vulnerable landscapes continues despite a lack of research to quantify the actual nutrient losses from intensive dairying on stony soils, (Lillburne, 2010, Carrick, 2013). Young stony sand soils in Canterbury were shown to have a high potential leaching risk of nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and cadmium in a scoping study (Carrick et al, 2014). Carrick recommended urgent large scale research programme into the effects of irrigation and intensification on vulnerable soils.  7  Mitigations to prevent nutrient loss from farms will increasingly impact on farm system design. Although mitigations may “hold the line” in terms of declining water quality, it is unlikely to be enough to prevent further deterioration in the face of large scale development of irrigation and intensification (>500,000 ha) proposed for NZ, (P.C.E Report, 2013). New Zealand loses between 200 and 300 million tonnes of soil to the ocean every year. This rate is about 10 times faster than the rest of the world, and accounts for between 1.1 and 1.7 percent of the world’s total soil loss to the oceans, despite a land area of only 0.1 percent of the world’s total, (PCE, 2004). 1.2.1 River Water Quality Reporting in New Zealand. River water quality monitoring in NZ includes nutrients (total and dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations including nitrate, ammoniacal nitrogen and dissolved reactive phosphorus), bacterial, visual clarity, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, and macro invertebrates, (NIWA , 2014). Overall, river water quality has deteriorated  over the past 20 years mainly as a result of diffuse losses from farming, (increased pastoral land cover) despite environmental gains  being made in terms of reduced point pollution. (Ballantine, 2010) (Ballantine, 2013) A study conducted by NIWA on water quality state from 1998 -2007 provides and insight into the polluted state of NZ’s rivers. Nutrient concentrations, which contribute to nuisance algal blooms, toxic algae, and decreased ecosystem health, frequently exceeded the ANZECC (2000) trigger values for ecosystem health. Water quality has declined in NZ’s rivers and catchments dominated by pastoral land use, with nutrient enrichment, water clarity and pathogen levels significantly worse than found in hill country and mountain categories (Ballantine et al, 2010). More recently developed regions in NZ exhibited similar trends. For example, Total nitrogen and nitrate in the Waimakariri River has shown a rapid upswing, (Ballantine, 2010).    8  1.2.2 Lake Water Quality Reporting in New Zealand Lake water quality is measured using the Trophic Level Index (TLI) which is widely used to measure changes in the total nitrogen, phosphorus, clarity and algal biomass (Burns, 1999).  Lakes SPI: Lake Submerged Plant Indicator, this is also used to measure structure and composition corresponding to the native and invasive character of vegetation in a lake. In a Lake Water (Status and Trends) Quality report by Verburg et al (2010) it was found that  44% were eutrophic (TLI >4) or worse. The TLI score increased with increasing percentage pastoral land cover and decreased with increasing percentage native or alpine land cover. When this data was extrapolated to all NZ lakes (3820 lakes nationwide) the data indicated that 32% would be eutrophic or worse while 43% would be oligotrophic or better.  1.2.3 Freshwater Demand in New Zealand. Water allocation is another key issue that affects water quality, and regional authorities still allocate water where they believe it will not jeopardise the sustainability of supply. There is no price on water in NZ, yet in almost every region, there are over allocated catchments and the demand for water is increasing. Over the period between 1999 and 2010 NZ’s weekly water allocation increased by one third. Allocation to uses such as irrigation of pasture has doubled since 1999, and there has been a 65% increase in irrigation allocation for pastoral uses in Canterbury alone and forty-six percent of the total NZ water use is allocated for irrigation (Ministry for the Environment, 2013) 1.2.4 Regional Trends: Waikato The indicators of water quality monitored at the regional level by Waikato regional council are in line with the National Indicators monitored by the Ministry for the Environment. Freshwater monitoring considers groundwater, lakes, rivers streams and wetlands.  9  Natural resources are seen as an integral part to lifestyle, and are of top concern for New Zealanders.  In a recent study by Hughey (2013), it was shown that the public are not in favour of development at the expense of their environment, they want to see rivers and recreational values protected and on the whole, New Zealanders want water that is clean, swimmable, fishable and safe for food gathering. This concern is reflected in the Waikato by the community where 50% of respondents in 2006 identified this as a key issue. (Waikato Regional Council, 2013) Overall, the community “don’t want” development to wreck fresh water environments they recreate in, they value the ecology and nature of these resources highly, (Baskaran, 2010; Hughey, 2013).  In a recent study by Vant, (2013) for the Waikato regional council, it was evident that trends were worsening. Clarity, for example has declined by 16% over the period of 1995-2013.  This may be partly due to significant areas of pine to pasture conversions in the upper river catchment since 2000. Over 29,000 ha of pine to pasture conversions occurred over the period from 2002 to 2008, (Hill et al, 2011). Since 2008, a further 8-10,000 Ha of conversions have occurred and are continuing (W.Vant pers comm Reg Council). A trend analysis of river water quality data over two decades (1992-2013) by Vant (2013) shows that turbidity, clarity and nitrogen levels have continued to worsen while phosphorus and chlorophyll a have remained stable or slightly improved. Groundwater is showing a trend of increasing nitrate levels.  Shallow lakes in the Waikato are not in good condition. Most Waikato lakes have moderate to extremely high levels of nutrient enrichment, with 30% being hypertrophic. (Waikato Regional Council 2013) Research based on data from 73 stream sites across the Waikato region found that median E. coli concentrations in 53 sites exceeded the guideline for freshwater recreation (median of 126 cfu/100ml), (Collins, 2002). The pattern of contamination across the Waikato is dominated by the presence of grazing livestock and the highest median E. coli concentrations are associated with the most intensive dairy farming in the centre of the region, (PCE, 2004). More than 90% of streams in intensively farmed catchments in the region have moderate to high levels of nitrogen. (PCE, 2004). At present there is little information about microbial contamination of rural groundwater, however a study of 40 wells in  10  Matangi found that 12.5% were contaminated with faecal coliforms. (PCE, 2004). The Waikato River below Horotiu (just north of Hamilton) due to coliform concentrations breaching the primary contact recreation limits, (Waikato Regional Council, 2013).  1.3  Initiatives to Protect Water Quality in New Zealand The National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management (NPS-FM)  provided guidance for setting limits on water quality for NZ including defined timeframes within which those targets are to be achieved, (NZ Government 2013). Regional Councils will be required to set freshwater objectives and limits through a collaborative process with their communities.  The National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management in NZ, (2011) sets objectives and policies that direct local government to manage water in an integrated and sustainable way, while providing for economic growth within set water quality and quantity limits. It states that  “the overall quality of fresh water within a region is maintained or improved while: a) protecting the quality of outstanding freshwater bodies, b) protecting the significant values of wetlands and, c) improving the quality of fresh water in water bodies that have been degraded by human activities to the point of being over-allocated.” (NZ Government, 2011). The policy makes it clear that where water bodies do not meet the freshwater objectives, regional councils must specify targets and methods to assist with improvement within a defined time frame. They must look at water bodies in the context of whole catchments, provide for involvement of iwi and hapu, and all regional councils must implement the changes as promptly as is reasonable, with full implementation of the policies no later than the end of 2030. Regional Plans would be used to manage activities and to ensure that the limits are not breached.  The Land and Water Forum aimed to bring together a range of industry groups, environmental and recreational NGOs, iwi, scientists, and other organisations with a stake in freshwater and land management in NZ. The Forum’s objective was to develop a shared vision and a common way forward among all those with an interest in water, through a stakeholder led collaborative process. The first report  11  of the Land and Water Forum, (LAWF) “A Fresh Start for Freshwater”, was released in September 2010 and set out for the first time in NZ, a blueprint for change in land and water management in NZ.  A second report was released by the LAWF in May 2012, aimed to set out a transparent process for setting objectives and limits. In November 2012, the forum released its third report, on “managing within limits.” It recommended integrated decision making in catchments, continuous improvement of management practises to improve water quality and clearer rights to take and use water within set limits, (Land and Water Forum, 2013). The second LAWF report noted quite clearly that NZ had difficulty setting limits. Without limits it is hard to manage diffuse discharges including nutrients, microbes, sediment and other contaminants. Limits provide certainty, that water can be used for a variety of purposes without unintended and unforeseen consequences. They inform users about the extractive and assimilative capacity of water bodies available for use, protect the key resources and help provide a more certain investment environment.  The LAWF acknowledged that there are governance issues, and some regional councils need additional resources and stronger governance skills, (LAWF, 2012). Meeting limits may mean more efficient resource use, tighter regulatory controls, changes in existing land-use practice (including improved management of farming systems) and a limited amount of land-use change in some catchments, (MfE, 2013).                                1.3.1 Setting Freshwater Objectives in New Zealand “Freshwater objectives are the intended environmental outcomes for a water body that will provide for the values the community considers important.”  The proposed changes to the NPS-FM, has been the inclusion of National Objectives Framework (NOF) (2013).  The primary issue that NOF was to address was to provide a framework which ensured that the life supporting capacity and ecosystem processes of freshwater were safeguarded, while meeting community and iwi aspirations for fresh water.  The National Objectives Framework will be implemented through regulation using the underpinning of the National Freshwater Statement for Freshwater 2011.   12  Other work has included economic analysis and modelling to test what environmental bottom lines will be tolerable for the various agricultural industries, without significant economic disruption, (Kaye-Blake et al, 2013, Snelder, 2013) The third and final report released by LAWF deals in detail with the linked issues of water quality and allocation of water, (LAWF, 2012).  A challenge highlighted, was the differences in the consenting processes whereby quantity and quality of water were dislocated in the planning and consenting process. Abstraction affects quality and quantity of water. In recommendation 8 (LAWF, 2012), a clear directive was for regional councils to go about setting freshwater objectives and limits including the identification of contaminants of concern and total load of each, in each catchment. A key issue raised by the LAWF, 2012 was that Regional Councils in NZ require more accountability, need to develop consistency of measurement and be open to independent auditing and scrutiny on their performance.  It is clear that degraded freshwater quality has negative consequences for all those who share the resource. Taxpayers and ratepayers bear the cost of poor management decisions that allow degradation to happen. Approximately $500 million of government and community money is committed to the clean-up of just eight lakes and rivers across NZ.  The “clean up initiative” also brings together a number of existing one-off clean- ups in Waikato, Rotorua, and Taupo.  The external costs of agriculture include a decline in recreational opportunities, reduced landscape and visual values, and the constraints on supply of, or additional treatment requirements for, drinking water, (Abell, 2011). The cost is external because individual farmers usually bear only a small share of the costs (economic, social and environmental) that arise from the depletion of the ecosystem services resulting from diffuse losses from farmland, (Baskaran etal , 2010; Abell, 2011). 1.4 The Challenge of Economy versus the Environment Dairy made a contribution of $14 billion to the national economy in 2013-14 and is the most significant type of agriculture in the primary sector in terms of  13  earnings. It is expected that dairy exports will continue to increase at 8% per annum to contribute $17.7 billion in 2016-17. (i.e.: >40% of the primary sector income), (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2013).  Dairying is now a major land use across NZ. Milk production increased by 47% in 10 years (2003-2013) to reach 1.69 billion kg of milk solids (MS) produced in 2012 and the industry now accounts for 21% of NZ’s grassland area and 46% of total stock units, (Dairy NZ, 2013). A typical NZ cow is equivalent to 8 stock units. The sheep and beef industry faces challenges and stock numbers are set to decline due to difficult years, droughts and competition from dairy. Increasingly the sheep and beef industry provides support and grazing for dairying. Both dairy and dairy support, have higher rates of nutrient loss than extensive pastoral agriculture. (NZIER, 2013; P.C.E, 2013). PCE, (2013) notes that a trend towards more dairying and its associated support land will  continue, while commodity prices favours industry growth, as a result, water quality is likely to continue to decline.  As yet in New Zealand, comprehensive trials implementing best practice at a sub-catchment scale in intensively farmed areas have failed to show that they can achieve water quality standards. Studies in the “best dairying catchments” of Waiokura and Toenepi over ten years have shown that stock exclusion and effluent management changes have not yet achieved contact recreation standards, (Waikato Regional Council, 2010).  Hamilton and Mc Dowell (2013) note that there is a gap in the literature, linking action at the farm gate to an effect in the receiving environment to support land owners to make sound management changes on and to their land. This will require mixing multiple disciplines and research across a range of temporal and spatial sites. (Mc Dowell, 2013) New Zealand dairy systems have not only expanded into new areas, but have also intensified in the last 10 years as shown in Table 1. Farm working expenses have increased by 190% over the past 13 years. (Greig, 2012; Dairy NZ 2013; Intelact NZ, 2014). Herd sizes have increased, along with milk production, reliance on bought in feeds such as palm kernel expeller, stocking rates, land prices and debt levels.    14  Table 1.1 - Table Derived from Greig (2012) Changing Dairy Farm Systems in NZ  The choice of farm system is largely influenced have evolved as farmers attempt to mitigate risk instinctively, (Greig, 2012). Desire by farmers on overstocked farms to avoid seasonal feed deficits from higher stocking rates, (1990’s  and early 2000) has resulted in the NZ dairy industry having a significant and increasing dependence on Palm Kernel Expeller (PKE) since its importation to NZ in 2003. At $300 per tonne, this supplementary feed is competitively priced in relation to the option of expanding a farming business to procure more pasture (generated from high cost land), (Dias et al, 2008). PKE availability has resulted in farm systems continuing to carry higher levels of stock and intensify (relative to the landscapes productive potential), and as a result, around 10% of NZ milk solids are now generated from PKE.  Economic principles of agricultural production are based around decisions arising from the relative prices of inputs and outputs, (Greig, 2012). Recent proposals for irrigation such as Ruataniwha dam include water price of 22-25c m3. Farm working expenses for a dairy farm in this scheme are around $5.50 a kg MS, when accounting for irrigation water. (Dewes 2013). Including debt servicing, the full  1998-99 2008-2009 2012- 13 % change Dairy Herds  14400 11400 11798 -18% No. cows milked  3.3m 4.2m 5.01m +35% Average herd size  229 364 393 +42% Average stocking rate In cows per hectare.  2.5 2.8 2.3-3.3  Total Milksolids per herd  70000 120000 141125 100% Tonnes of PKE  + other  feed imports to NZ 0 1,300,000T 1,889,000T  PKE kg  fed per cow on average 0  407 kg  Milksolids derived from PKE + other 0  170 m  Value of Milk Derived from PKE/other 0  $1190 M  National production (million litres)  880m 1393m 1665m 95% Land Price $/kg MS  18.4 50.8 $40.46 126% Farm working expenses per kg MS  2.13 3.85 4.08 190% Liabilities/kg MS  8.03 19.87 19.24 145% Debt Servicing/Gross Farm Revenue.

Irrigation of dairy in a scheme such as this results in the cost of production being 250% greater than 1988-99 while milk solids prices have only risen approximately 100% since that time. Farm systems change continues to occur rapidly in NZ, and intensification of farm systems entails higher risk: both economic (due to diminished margins), and environmental (requirement for more complex mitigations). Recently converted farms in Canterbury for example, are more intensive than those at a national level. Sixty three percent of farm systems in Canterbury were reported as importing 20-50% of their feed (via direct supplements or off farm grazing) (Agfirst Waikato, 2009). Intensive systems rely on support land to supply feed requirements for young stock, wintering cows, and supplementation. Canterbury, for example, where there is diffuse nitrogen enrichment of surface and groundwater, (Ford, 2012) support land area is 50-100% of the irrigated dairy milking platform area. This situation results in intensification of extensive pastoral agriculture catchments to support more intensive farm systems. More intensive systems are both vulnerable e.g. from climatic or commodity price fluctuations, but are also coupled with an increased risk of contaminant losses; (Monaghan, 2007; Kaye-Blake et al, 2013; P.C.E, 2013),  As part of adaptive management, all agricultural systems should be regularly assessed on their “farm system risk to the receiving environment”. Several metrics to assess farm system risk are preferred due to their sensitivity to change as a function of land management change, (Sydorovych, 2009). Metrics should be applicable across all sectors of agriculture, and clearly understood by farmers and policy makers. Indicators providing quantifiable results and science based thresholds are preferable, (van der Werf, 2001). Internationally, there have been a range of agri-environmental indicators (AEI’s)  developed to validate an agricultural systems risk combining of “management based” and “environmental effects” based metrics, (van der Werf, 2001; Galan, 2007; Pretty, 2008). It is evident that farm systems reconfiguration will be required in order to meet environmental outcomes. Dairy NZ work has demonstrated that an 18-40% reduction in N loss is possible through farm system change with adversely affecting profitability in some cases. (Beukes et al, 2012;  Clark 2012, Dairy NZ  16  2013). This  may involve lower bodyweight (stocking rates) carried per hectare, (Beukes et al 2012) reducing replacement rates combined with high genetic- merit cows, on well balanced diets, enhanced feed conversion efficiency and improved effluent capture with widespread low risk application to pasture (>40% of farm area), reducing the need for soluble fertiliser use.  Debt and vulnerability of the dairy sector may hamper rapid response times to environmental compliance by the industry. New Zealand’s dairy sector debt nearly tripled over the past decade, to $30.5 billion in 2012, (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2013).  Extended and more frequent periods of dry weather in some regions increases the vulnerability of dairy farmers through lower  milk revenues and higher feed costs,(Kalaugher et al, 2013).  It was estimated that 40% of North Island dairy farmers could not meet their expenses and debt obligations as a result of the 2012-13 drought, (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2013).  Government initiatives are strongly supportive of further intensification of both marginal landscapes and increased irrigation. (Funding Programmes for Irrigation, 2013) There is a goal to drive an annual growth rate of  7% per annum in the agricultural sector (Riddet Institute, 2010) through a combination of strategies, capture, storage and better use of freshwater, along with improved productivity of Maori Owned Land, (Price Waterhouse Coopers, 2013) as well as increased productivity from current agriculture. The growth seen in agriculture between 1985 and 2011 was 3%. The Agribusiness Agenda (KPMG, 2013) aiming to double agricultural output by 2025, will place considerably more pressure on to a national landscape suffering from decades of poorly regulated intensification.  A big challenge is how we manage and balance growth as a nation.  Integrated approaches and practices will be required to help farming reduce the negative impacts of production on the environment whilst maintaining economic viability, (Cook, 2009; Mc Dowell & Hamilton 2013).   17  1.4.1 Agri -environmental Indicators of Risks and Effects from Dairy Farm Practices.  1.4.1.1 Greenhouse Gas and Nutrient Emissions Agriculture contributes about 60% of New Zealand’s total greenhouse gas emissions, with 90% of these agricultural emissions comprising CH4 and N2O in terms of CO2 equivalents. (De Klein, 2002). The principle source of agricultural methane is enteric fermentation in the digestive tract of ruminants, (DeKlein, 2001).   Along with gaseous emissions, nitrate (NO 3) leaching and water contamination is a major environmental issue around the globe. In grazed grassland, most of the nitrate leaching occurs in patches of animal urine because of high nitrogen (N) loading rates on a small area, (Di.H, 2007). Thus the predominant source of nitrogen loss from dairy farming is that from urine patches.  OVERSEER is a nutrient management decision support tool based on nutrient budgeting at a farm scale. The model has been applied widely to New Zealand farming systems and is widely used to estimate nitrogen discharges at the individual farm level, (Monaghan, 2007).  Nitrogen discharges are estimated based on the main potential sources (cow urine, manure, milking shed effluent and fertilizer), and losses are based on animal type and productivity, soil group, drainage status and rainfall, (Ramilan, 2011). The model estimates losses to the environment at the boundary of the farm system e.g. N loss to water (leaching), P run-off risk and greenhouse gas emissions. Best Management Practises (BMPs) are assumed in all OVERSEER simulations, (Wheeler 2013). The model assumes there is no direct input of excreta to waterways, such as direct animal access to streams/rivers or via stock crossings, tracks or lanes and that the effluent storage ponds are lined with impermeable materials and effluent is only applied under low risk conditions. (Appendix 5)  If these best practices are not conducted, the nutrient loss to waterways will be higher than what is reported by OVERSEER, (Wheeler 2013; Horne, pers comm, 2013).  Nitrogen loss risk (kg N ha-1 yr -1) as an output from OVERSEER is widely accepted in NZ as the best indicator of a farms risk to the receiving water body Indicators such as nutrient use efficiency and nutrient loss are “effects based measures from farming activities.” These measures are used quantify the risk of  18  an activity to the receiving environment. Nutrient loss risk should be read in association with nitrogen (N) surplus and N conversion efficiency. The N surplus per hectare is defined as the difference between input and output of N divided by the size of the farm in hectares, (Beukes,2012). Small surpluses mean a reduced pressure on the environment per hectare, (Halberg,1999). Nitrogen conversion efficiency (an OVERSEER output) can be a useful measure to read alongside N loss.  Phosphorus loss is also important. Seventy percent of dairy farms on volcanic soils are operating with high or excessive soil Olsen P levels which is high risk, (Waikato Regional Council 2008; Ledgard, 2011). Serious losses occur when there is soil damage such as pugging and runoff events on exposed or ploughed soils occurs, (Monaghan, 2007; Mc Dowell & Wilcock 2004 &2007 and Mc Dowell 2013; Waikato Regional Council, 2013). “Critical source areas” such as erosion proned areas, lack of waterways fencing, fertiliser form, crop and soil damage, raceway runoff , intensively stocked areas, and high risk effluent application processes, need spatial and temporal identification and mitigation across catchments, (Monaghan, 2007; Ledgard, 2011; Houlbrooke, 2013, Mc Dowell ,2007, 2009 & 2013). The P loss risk measured by OVERSEER however, does not take into account storm events, runoff from 1st and 2nd order streams which are farmed as part of a grazing platform in many cases, and assumes all best practices are always in place. (Mc Dowell 2013). 1.4.1.2 Soil Protection and Effluent Management Environmental monitoring of Waikato regional rivers and streams indicates that levels of bacteria exceed the Australian and New Zealand guidelines for Fresh and Marine Water Quality 2000 in 75% of sites, and are too excessive for people to swim safely in 70% of monitored sites. (Environment Waikato, 2008). The process-based understanding of Faecal Indicator Organism fate and transport at the catchment-scale is, at best, rudimentary, (Monaghan, 2007; Kay, 2008; Muirhead, 2013).  High risk connectivity points such as stock feeding areas, tracks, crossings, sub surface drains, and effluent discharges to high risk soil types all provide opportunities for direct runoff or deposition of pathogens as well as  19  nutrient into receiving waters. (Monaghan, 2005 & 2007; Richie 2010;  Wheeler 2013) 1.4.1.3 Waterway, Wetland Protection and Biodiversity Support Direct waterway protection on farm involving stock exclusion and protective planting is an important part of reducing impacts and supporting native biodiversity. (Beswell et al, 2007;Collins et al, 2007;Wilcock et al, 2009) Waikato has one of the highest rates of biodiversity loss compared to other regions in New Zealand  – only 26 per cent of the region remains in native vegetation and this is fragmented into thousands of small patches mostly in hill country. New Zealand has the highest proportion of threatened freshwater fish species ( 68%). This number has been increasing over time – up from 20% in 1992. (Alibone et al, 2010).  1.4.1.4  Water Use Efficiency  The demonstration of water use efficiencies and water saving technologies in the farm system are increasingly important as agriculture is the major abstractor of water in most countries.  Future food systems will need to operate with less water, (Wallace, 2000). Pressures are already arising from urbanisation, industrialisation, degrading water sources and climate change. (OECD, 2012). Where water is used for irrigation of pasture, expected practices will include the use of technologies to monitor abstraction, ensuring precise and efficient use occurs with minimal runoff to groundwater for designated crops. (Evans, 2013) (Hedley, 2012) 1.4.1.5 Energy Use and Waste Management Practices  Energy usage on farm can be linked with increased greenhouse gas emissions and costs Therefore using low cost or low emission energy generation with in production systems is beneficial and of lower impact, (Barber, 2005). Waste management on farm is also is cause for concern. At present, burning and burying of waste on farms the most common waste disposal method, and was carried out by more than 60% of farmers surveyed by Taranaki Regional Council in 2004.  (Taranaki Regional Council, 2005). Recently, Environment Canterbury has reminded farmers that from 2014, they will not be able to burn polyethylene  20  agricultural silage/bale wraps but are to use product stewardship schemes, such as Plasback or Agrorecovery. (Environment Canterbury, 2014). 1.4.1.6 Quantifying the Environmental Risks from Farming Systems. It is evident there is an urgent need to quantify risk to the receiving environment from different farming systems in NZ. There is growing awareness that it is possible for eco-efficient agriculture to result in increased productivity while concurrently reducing negative environmental impacts, (Keating, 2013; Roberts, 2013).  Demand for easy to understand measures of environmental and social sustainability of food systems is growing rapidly, driven by greater producer awareness of public perception and the need to inform catchment groups and policy makers, (van der Werf, 2001;  King,  2000; Jay, 2008; Pretty, 2008). Suppliers of agricultural food products are increasingly expected to demonstrate a deep understanding of the environmental and social attributes of their products. This should include the materials and energy used, potential human and ecological health impacts, and product development, (Pretty, 2008; Aneilski, 2010).  1.5 Objectives of the Study Using economic and environmental data of 25 Upper Waikato farms, this study set out to test what management criteria contribute to a lower environmental footprint and more economically resilient farm systems. These factors are considered important in the context of a volatile commodity market, changing climatic conditions and a national review of water policy. In Chapter 2 the development of an environmental scorecard is described.  This scorecard is designed to quantify a farms risk to the receiving environment. It was hypothesised that economic prosperity and resilience of farm systems may not be compromised by careful reductions of diffuse losses and improved environmental performance.  In Chapter 3 the economic performance of farms with good environmental performance was examined, based on their return on capital. Economic resilience is described as the farm systems that can demonstrate both strong and the most stable return on capital when milk prices alter by 20% or more.  Specific features of farm management were sought that conferred profitability and resil
