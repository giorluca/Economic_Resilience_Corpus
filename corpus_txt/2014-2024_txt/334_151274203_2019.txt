However, when dealing with high-temperature waste heat, organic Rankine cycle facesefficiency limit due to the physical properties of the working and thermal fluids. That gives room for furtherenhancement of the waste heat recovery technologies via the investigation of different non-conventionalschemes as one of the possible ways. In the present work, a system introducing the combined inverted Braytonplus organic Rankine cycle is under investigation. Aspen Hysys models of both conventional organic Rankinecycle and combined cycle were designed, orienting on waste heat recovery from the heavy-load gas-fueledreciprocating engine exhaust. In this way, the performance of the combined scheme was benchmarked versus theconventional organic Rankine cycle. An assessment of the organic Rankine cycle working fluids was provided,and pentane has shown the best thermodynamic performance. The study on inverted Brayton cycle defined theremarkable effect of the water condensation in the gas duct on the inverted Brayton cycle performance. Finally,both thermodynamic and economic optimizations of the models were conducted, setting the stage for thecomparison of solutions. Results have shown the 10% advantage of the combined scheme over organic Rankinecycle in generated power and system efficiency. The levelized-cost-of-energy-based optimization for variablecapacity factors has highlighted above 6% advantage of the investigated solution. The analysis of the sensitivityfrom machines’ efficiencies and heat exchangers’ pinches has shown that with some sets of parameters, thestudied scheme may concede to the organic Rankine cycle.1. IntroductionThe general trend of developed countries for decarbonization ofeconomy and pollution reduction continues increasing the pressure onindustry expressed in the growth of carbon dioxide (CO2) taxation andstrengthening regulations. Federal Energy Management Program in theUSA [1], Climate Change Agreement in the United Kingdom [2], not tosay, Paris agreement [3] set the direction of this trend and prescribe thetightening changes. This economic pressure and targeted investmentbecame a driver for many new technical fields. One of them is wasteheat recovery (WHR) for power generation and technological processes.Reach variety of technologies for WHR was scientifically studied:steam Rankine cycle (SRC), organic Rankine cycle (ORC), organic Flashcycle (OFC), conventional and inverted Brayton cycle (IBC), super-critical and transcritical CO2 (sCO2 and tCO2), Kalina cycle, Stirlingcycle, Thermoelectric generators (TEG), and other solutions and theircombinations, which are less studied in the scientific literature. Some ofthese technologies have already been applied in industrial practice. Thedescription and analysis of the majority of WHR technologies can befound in the work of Jouhara (2018) [4]. Lecompte (2015) [5] hasreviewed the recent studies of ORC, which were conducted in the lastyears for different areas of application, working fluids, and heat sourcetemperatures. For the on-road engines, ORC for the WHR was observedby Lion (2017) [6]. Application of ORC for WHR from technologicalprocesses was studied by Campana (2013) [7], who estimated the po-tential of the large-scale realization of this technology in 20 000 GWh/year of recovered thermal energy and 7.6Mton of non-produced CO2.sCO2 and tCO2 were investigated in several works, e.g., Wang X. (2016)[8] or Marchionni (2018) [9]. Ref. [8] has compared tCO2 and ORC forthe WHR from primary sCO2 cycle, concluding that for a range ofhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecmx.2019.100014Received 29 January 2019; Received in revised form 27 June 2019; Accepted 30 June 2019⁎ Corresponding author.E-mail address: kirill.abrosimov@skolkovotech.ru (K.A.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/BY/4.0/).Tparameters tCO2 is preferable than ORC; however, the second law ef-ficiency is comparable, and the total product unit cost is slightly betterfor the combination of sCO2 with ORC. Ref. [9] has studied eight dif-ferent configurations of sCO2 for various high-temperature WHR ap-plications, with the total cycle efficiency varying from 20 to 27.5%approximately, and LCOE around 100 $/MW for the temperature cor-responding to the nominal case of the present work. Yari (2015) [10]compared Kalina cycle with ORC and its transformed version, so-calledtrilateral Rankine cycle (TRC) characterized by triangle shape of T-Sdiagram due to the expansion initialized from the saturation line. Theauthors concluded that although ORC is losing TRC in maximum op-timal obtained power (from 14 to 35 percent difference depending onthe assumed expander efficiency) but TRC superiority in optimizedsystem product cost depends on expander efficiency differently (from3% lower values to 10% higher). KC has lost both in power and costoptimizations. Finally, the authors concluded that ORC is the best op-tion for low-temperature heat utilization. Interestingly, these conclu-sions are less favorable for TRC than the results of the earlier worksabout TRC, e.g. of Fischer (2011) [11]. Later, Nemati (2017) [12]compared KC with ORC specifically for the WHR, reporting 22.5% su-periority of the ORC over KC in generated power. IBC is a technologywhich has not found a strong field of application yet; however, it has apotential for high-temperature cases (Bianchi 2011 [13]). This tech-nology will be discussed below in more details. At the same time, theapplication of conventional Brayton cycle for WHR is a rare case.However, it was just recently studied by Nader (2018) [14] who re-ported 5.5% to 7% fuel economy for the intercooled configuration incomparison with the base case. OFC technology is a relatively new fieldof study and discussed in few works. E.g., Lee (2016) [15] comparedOFC in two configurations with ORC, concluding the advantage inproduced net power of the OFC with two-phase expander over ORC forthe evaporation temperature below 110 °C. Baccioli (2017) [16] de-fined a new architecture to reduce OFC equipment cost for the tem-perature of heat source in the range 80–170 °C. The Stirling cycle forWHR was not so comprehensively investigated (e.g., reviewed by WangK. (2016) [17]). Both OFC and Stirling are reported as having a goodprospect but facing specific engineering problems of certain compo-nents, that is why they do not have sufficient practical validation. Usageof the non-mechanical ways of energy harvesting for WHR purpose hasalso been studied (e.g., Zhang Y. (2015) [18]) (The results have shownthat this solution is suitable only for specific cases due to the essentiallimitations of efficiency and heat transfer parameters (Jouhara (2018)[4]). However, Jouhara expects sufficient growth of the efficiency ofTEGs in the nearest future. This small overview shows that a lot ofvarious WHR technologies are under the intent attention of the scien-tific community. At the same time, ORC holds the leading position asone of the most efficient, reliable, and cost-effective solutions fortemperatures below 400 °C.On the other hand, the study of reviews and dedicated technicalpapers mentioned above has shown that in the range of exhaust tem-perature between 400 °C and 650 °C there is a gap in available, efficientWHR technologies as ORC has specific limitations on reaching higherefficiencies for the higher temperatures. Summarizing the large scope ofresearches in the field of WHR generating facilities based on ORC,Lecompte (2015) [5] has studied a group of works dedicated to thehigh-temperature ORC: in the range of about 250–400 °C; this is a low-middle temperature waste heat according to Zhai (2016) [19] classifi-cation.

Abrosimov, et al. Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 1000142temperature range. One is the physical properties of available organicfluids suitable for this purpose with attention to the critical tempera-ture, temperatures of stability, flammability, and condensation pres-sure. Another one, driven by operational requirements from the be-ginning, is the practical infeasibility of the schemes without anintermediate thermal oil loop (TOL) (Shi (2018) [20]). The maximumworking temperature of found thermal oil is below 400 °C (e.g., Ther-minol VP-1 [21]). Thus, the connection between efficiency and max-imum temperature of a thermodynamic cycle reveals the incompleteuse of heat potential when ORC utilizes the exhaust with the tem-perature above 400 °C. Bianchi (2011) [13] derives the work with asimilar conclusion.However, studies show that many industrial processes and enginesrelease energy flows to the atmosphere at a higher temperature. Heattreating furnaces for a range of materials, drying and baking ovens,cement kilns, and also gas turbines and reciprocating engines produceexhaust gases at temperatures from 400 °C to 650 °C. Table 1 representsthe summary of the sources in the temperature range of interest for thisstudy. For the United States, the total heat (referenced to 25 °C) con-taining in industrial waste flows at medium temperature (230–650 °C)exceed 132·109 kWh/year ([22]) that can be converted to more than19.8·109 kWh/year of electrical energy assuming the average efficiencyof conversion equal to 15%. This number, which exceeds 0.5% of totalannual US electricity consumption [23], show sufficient prospects forthe utilization technologies specially sharpened to this temperaturerange. As the temperature limitation for the ORC, discussed in theprevious paragraph, equals to 400 °C, this work has a focus on thetemperature range from 400 °C to 650 °C.Among all sources of waste heat, the power-generating engines re-quire separate attention. In opposite with technological facilities, theirprimary purpose is power production. It means that the appearance ofadditional power capacity does not brings changes neither to thebusiness neither technical process. The same arguments are generallycorrect for the vehicle engines and other prime movers like gas turbinesof gas compressor stations. In the authors’ opinion, this is the mainreason for the essential interest of the R&D and scientists to the topic ofWHR in this area. Optimizations and techno-economic assessments ofORC for WHR after different kinds of engines are widespread in sci-entific literature and public industrial reports. Examples of detailedstudies of such cases are reported in the study of Lion (2017) [6] andSprouse (2013) [32], both reviewed and studied not only thermo-dynamics and economics but also the part-load under typical operationschedule for a heavy-load truck. In the review, Lion [6] reports ORC asthe most applicable technology for this purpose with achievable fueleconomy up to 10% at full load. Sprouse [32] has a similar conclusionof the review, also underlining that there is no ideal working mediumoptimal for all cases. In the work of Yue (2014) [33], the influence ofthe ORC integration to the performance of 2MW Diesel engine wasstudied. The results showed that not only the efficiency of the ORCmodule but the corresponding efficiency drop of the topping cycle ap-pearing due to backpressure growth should be considered. Xu (2019)[34] also has noted the importance of this factor.IBC is a technology, which is more suitable for high-temperatureWHR than ORC from the perspective of the usage of high-temperaturegases. In the scientific literature, it is studied in different configurationsfor a variety of applications. The standalone operation of IBC as a powergenerating unit was studied in papers of Henke (2013) [35], Agelidou(2017) [36], and Valdés (2016) [37]. Henke [35] has analyzed theinfluence of temperatures in different points of the cycle and watercondensation in the duct and concluded the unclear prospects of thetechnology due to low efficiency and high capital cost. However, thiswork was continued in the paper of Agelidou (2017) [36] with ex-perimental data of small power-generating facility (about 1 kW). Valdes(2016) [37] compared IBC with BC and sCO2 for the micropowergeneration (about 1MW) and estimate the IBC results as the worstbecause of its lower efficiency. Another group of researches is dedicatedto the bottoming application of IBC with conventional BC in differentconfigurations: Venkata (2012) [38], Matviienko (2016) [39], Chen(2017) [40], for instance. In Venkata (2012) [38], the focus lies mostlyon the exploring the use of teaching-learning-based technique, alsoadopting artificial “bee colony” algorithms, for the optimization ofcombined BC-IBC system. Matviinko (2012) [39] has investigated theBC-IBC combination for the marine propulsion system, claiming thepositive results of the system at part-load regimes due to the variablearea nozzle. Chen (2017) [40] declared the maximum resulting averagebrake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) improvement equal to 3.02%,also discussing the optimal choice of pressure ratio for the conditions ofstandard driving cycle. Bianchi (2005) [29] studied this combinationfrom the point of view of the base BC repowering, standing in the originof the modern study of IBC. As a power-generating or repowering so-lution going after reciprocating engine, the IBC was studied mostly asan addition or an alternative to turbo-compounding. Copeland (2016)[40] and Hu (2016) [41] investigated the thermodynamic potential ofdifferent versions of this scheme. In his later work, Bianchi (2011) [13]in the review of bottoming cycles for electricity generation emphasizedthe potential of IBC for CHP application with the temperature of pri-mary exhaust higher than 400 °C. Also, several non-conventional ap-plications of the cycle were analyzed; Weber (2010) [42] studied acombined scheme of IBC and steam Brayton cycle applied with thechemical looping combustion reactor. All mentioned works report thepresence of both the advantages and disadvantages of the IBC for WHRor power generation. One of the main questions to IBC is a high unusedenergy potential of the utilized exhaust gas.Concluding this overview, it may be underlined that, on the onehand, there is a group of technologies producing high-temperatureexhaust (400–650 °C) and suitable for WHR. Specifically, WHR fromexhaust gases of the power and automotive internal combustion engines(ICE) worth attention. On the other hand, existing technologies in thisTable 1Exhaust temperature for different technological processes.Source Tw.h., °C Reference CommentsReciprocating engines 340–620 GE™ [24], CAT™ [25]550–660 Elfasakhany (2016) [26] Acetone-gasoline mix.500–750 Masum (2014) [27] Alcohol-gasoline mix.315–600 Zeb (2017) [28]Gas turbines 440–625 Bianchi (2005) [29] Elec. power < 10MW370–540 Zeb (2017) [28]Heat treating furnaces 425–650 Zeb (2017) [28]Drying and baking ovens 230–600 Zeb (2017) [28]Cement kilns 280–450 Shabana (2013) [30]450–620 Zeb (2017) [28]Glass industry 500 Campana (2013) [7]Petroleum coke production 480–540 Neeharika (2012) [31]Catalytic crackers 425–650 Zeb (2017) [28]K.A. Abrosimov, et al. Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 1000143field show low efficiency and high cost because of some essential ob-stacles for being used for high temperatures. To cope with this chal-lenge, a solution based on the combination of ORC and IBC is beingsuggested; it brings the growth of WHR system efficiency and attrac-tiveness of the investment into WHR projects.Previously, the author worked with IBC, which has a separate in-troduction in the paper as IBC is not so commonly known. The idea toimprove IBC with ORC integration is not completely new (e.g., IP dis-closure in [43]), but was not studied in the scientific literature. Thiswork demonstrates a comparative analysis of this scheme bench-marking it versus the conventional ORC. The realization of the modelwas performed in Aspen Hysys 9 software with usage of its standard 1-Dcomponents. As a target case, the Internal Combustion Engine of sui-table capacity was chosen. Additionally, an authentic approach to theestimation of the IBC turbomachines’ efficiency was introduced. Thenegative influence of the ORC to the primary engine emphasized in Yue(2014) [33] is not taken into account to keep the work simpler. How-ever, the introduction of IBC compensates this influence and gives onemore advantage for the proposed scheme, so it is a conservative as-sumption of the comparison.In this work, the investigated combined IBC-ORC scheme, which, tothe authors’ best knowledge, was never systematically studied before, iscompared with the ORC-based solution with orientation on the case-study of a stationary gas-fired reciprocating engine. To define the bestresult on the in-house simulator, the ORC model was designed andoptimized for three different fluids, considering cycle limitations fromQuoilin 2012 [44]. This approach provides preliminary techno-eco-nomic feasibility assessment of the ORC and differs from pure ther-modynamic estimations. The fluids correspond to three levels of criticaltemperature. The ORC was built in two configurations: regenerativeand non-regenerative ORC and optimized for the properties of inletexhaust gas corresponding to the nominal case (temperature 520 °C).The next step was the comparison of the efficiency-optimized combinedscheme in two configurations: with regenerative ORC and without re-generation, and two configurations of the conventional ORC. The effi-ciency of the IBC turbomachinery was assessed by a simplified tech-nique based on Reynolds number adapted for this specific case (seeSection 2.2.5 and Appendix C). The inlet temperature of the exhaust gaswas varied from 470 to 570 °C. The working medium for all cases ispentane, as it was defined in the previous step as the best option. Thesensitivity analysis for the most important parameters was performed toestimate the influence of assumptions of the components’ parameters onthe results. Additionally, the optimal characteristics of IBC for differenttemperatures are shown, as well as the condensation rate in the sub-atmospheric duct and its influence on the IBC performance under dif-ferent turbine pressure ratios. The third part of the results is dedicatedto the LCOE evaluation for four potential investment projects based onthe investigated schemes. LCOE is shown for the different capacityfactor1 (CF) values of the potential facility at the nominal inlet para-meters. These results are obtained after LCOE-based optimization.Summarizing, the contribution of this work is to provide the firstsystematic study of the combined IBC-ORC scheme. It includes a com-parative analysis versus the most deployed WHR technology – the ORC,a sensitivity analysis from external parameters (inlet temperature) andmodel assumptions, and an LCOE calculation for different CF of thefacility. The methodology used in this first assessment is based on massand energy balance to define an optimal design of the scheme, byconsidering actual limitations for ORC (adopted from the literature),flue gas dewpoint, and a method for the estimation of IBC turbo-machinery efficiency. Applied reliable commercial software enables notto be focused on the components’ models but to get a credible assess-ment of the whole new system. This work gives the first estimation boththermodynamic and economic of the operation of such a scheme, andits potential for further research. It suggests an optimized configurationfor the advanced WHR system by providing useful information for thedesign of numerical or physical models of this high-efficiency and cost-effective high-temperature WHR scheme.2. Model descriptionIn this paragraph, the model of the WHR system is reported, with afocus on the description of the IBC.2.1. Inverted Brayton cycleInverted Brayton Cycle is another version of the conventionalBrayton cycle but with a turbine immediately in the inlet for the hotmedium. The medium may heat up in the combustion chamber, in theheat exchanger (HE) from a source of waste heat; or the system maydirectly receive exhaust gases from an engine or some technologicalprocess. Fig. 1a and b show T-S diagram and generalized scheme of thecycle. The hot gas performs useful work in the turbine (process 2–3),where it is cooled down correspondingly with the pressure decrease andgoes to the cooler under subatmospheric pressure (point 3). Beingcooled down to the temperature close to ambient (point 4), the gas flowfrom the cooler recovers pressure back to the atmospheric level in thecompressor (process 4–5) subsequently having the temperature growthduring this process; after that, the gas is released to the atmosphere(point 6 at the T-S diagram).Subatmospheric pressure provides both advantages and dis-advantages to the scheme, which were summarized in the previouswork Abrosimov (2017) [45]. Additionally, for the WHR applicationwith the direct intake of exhaust gases, it can be underlined that noexternal work is needed for pushing heat-containing medium throughthe system due to the compressor, which drives this flow. In otherwords, the system does not create back-pressure for the primary engineor another gas source.Fig. 1a. T-S diagram of IBC.

Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 10001442.2. Case study technical descriptionThis chapter presents the technical aspects of the work. In the be-ginning, the targeted case-study is described. Further, the investigatedscheme receives a detailed introduction, as well as the ORC, which wasstudied to provide the benchmark for the comparison. Then, the si-mulation assumptions and adopted limitations are listed. Finally, aspecific methodology for estimation of efficiency of bladed machines inconditions of IBC is presented.2.2.1. Targeted applicationThe present work orients to the heat utilization from the re-ciprocating engine exhaust. Study of Diesel and gas-fired power anddriving engines enables to define a range of exhaust temperature onnominal load (GE™ [24] and CAT™ [25]). Reciprocating internal com-bustion engines up to 1400 kW capacity (e.g., Waukesha VHP L7044GSIS5) have exhaust temperatures that can reach up to 620 °C. This ob-servation motivates authors to assess the proposed technology for theprimary engine from the capacity range of 500–1400 kW and exhausttemperatures from 400 °C to 600 °C. And the focus is on gas-fired en-gines, which have been becoming more and more important in powerproduction and propulsion systems. Summarizing, the supposed nom-inal case of the source of the waste heat in this study is a gas-firedreciprocating engine with the power of about 1MW with the nominalexhaust temperature 520 °C and gas flow rate 1.47 kg/s. Its chemicalcomposition presented in Appendix A corresponds to the natural gasburning at air combustion coefficient α= 1.2 [46], and air humidityequals 60%.The useful power is employed by an electric generator. On this firststage, useful application of heat was not considered, leaving the CHPsolution investigation for the next steps.2.2.2. Investigated combined schemesThe layout and T-S diagram of the combined IBC-ORC scheme withnon-regenerative ORC (CS) is shown in Fig. 2a and b. Fig. 3 presents thecombined scheme with regenerative ORC (CS Reg); the difference in theoperation of these two configurations is described below. In the fol-lowing paragraph, the processes that occur in the first configuration areilluminated.In point 1 of Fig. 2, hot exhaust gas, assumed to be at atmosphericpressure, enters the duct of the WHR system expanding in a gas turbineto the point 2 of the sub-atmospheric pressure and lower temperature.The usual values for the case studied are the pressure from 45 to 55 kPawhat corresponds to the turbine inverse pressure ratio T' =1.8–2.4easily achievable by one stage radial machines, where = p p/ .T T in T out'. .After the Turbine, the gas goes through the gas-to-thermal-oil heatexchanger (HE-1), which is the pass of the heat to the ORC part of thecycle, and finally, it is cooled down in the air Cooler to 35 °C – point 4.Condensation takes place in the Cooler, so a separator was introducedto the scheme after the Cooler. The separator is not presented on thescheme. The cooled gas is compressed up to the atmospheric pressure inthe compressor and directed to the outlet. The compressor pressureratio ( C) is slightly higher than the turbine one, where = p p/C C out C in. . .Thermal oil from the HE-1 (point 11) goes to the Evaporator arriving tothe oil pump (II) at point 12.Working fluid heated up in the Evaporator with the super-heatingnot less than 5 °C for the sake of the process stability (point 21) goes tothe Expander, which in the studied case is assumed to be a radial tur-bine, where the pressure and temperature decrease. Then, the low-pressure vapor in point 22 is cooled down in the air-cooled Condenser.Cooling air temperature is supposed to be 20 °C. Hence, the lowestpossible temperature of working fluid considering the pinch limit 5 °Cmay go a little below 30 °C. The observed range of the pressure after theCondenser is above 70 kPa, which fulfills the lowest technically feasiblelimit of 20 kPa set by (Quoilin (2012) [44]). After the Compressor, apump (I) increases the pressure of the medium to the 2500–3000 kPaand directs the working fluid to the Evaporator.The combined scheme (Fig. 3) equipped with regenerative ORC (CSReg) differs from the basic one in the values of temperatures in some ofthe key points of ORC. Temperature before the Condenser is higher aswell as before the Evaporator due to heat exchange of flows in the re-generator (Regen. – in Fig. 3). It leads to an increase of the lowesttemperature of the oil loop and, thus, gas temperature after HE-1. Thecooling power of the Cooler must be increased to ensure that thetemperature of the gas entering the compressor is equal to referenced35 °C.2.2.3. Organic Rankine cycleThe above mentioned combined scheme was studied and bench-marked against an ORC-based solution, which is currently theFig. 2a. Scheme of the combined cycle.Fig. 2b. T-S diagram of the combined cycle.Fig. 3. Scheme of the combined cycle with regenerative ORC part.K.A. Abrosimov, et al. Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 1000145technology with higher deployment. The non-regenerative cycle wasalso considered to make the comparison inclusive. The scheme of thenon-regenerative ORC is presented in Fig. 4. In this system, the heatfrom the exhaust gas flow is transmitted in the HE-1 to the workingmedium of the cycle through the TOL with similar parametric as-sumptions.2.2.4. Assumptions and limitationsAssumptions for equipment type, losses, efficiencies, some fixedtemperatures, and heat transfer parameters are presented in Table 2and commented below.Equipment type. The type of heat exchangers was chosen from the listavailable in Turton (2008) [47] based on the fluids, pressure, heat flow,and practices established in this technical area. Turton’s book was usedfor economic assessment (see chapter 2.4). Radial compressor andturbine for IBC part are suitable for the investigated range of flow rate,pressure ratio, and temperature (Dixon (2010) [48]). ORC expandertype was chosen based on data in Quoilin (2012) [44].Losses. Here, the relative drops of pressure in the HEs caused bymechanical losses are listed. Relative pressure drop is defined as:=p p p/ in.Isentropic efficiencies of bladed machines. Efficiencies of the bladedmachines in the IBC part are discussed in chapter 2.2.5. ORC expanderefficiency corresponds to values in literature.Heat transfer coefficient. The parameter was defined, relying on thedata in Sinnott (2005) [49]. The Evaporator was simulated as a group ofthree different HEs representing pre-heating, evaporation, and super-heating processes in the evaporator. An own separate value of Uoverallcorresponds for each of these HE. The resulting value for the wholeEvaporator lies in the range indicated in Table 2 and depends on otherdesign parameters of the system.Cooling air temperature and the temperature of cooled gas before theCompressor correspond to an assumed temperature of the coolant in theCondenser and the Cooler, and an assumed temperature before thecompressor, respectively. The second value is fixed to reduce thenumber of variables in the simulation, and it is higher than the lowesttemperature of the working fluid in the condenser because of worseheat-exchange conditions: the phase transition occurs in the Condenser,but, in the Cooler, an only small fraction of water has phase change.Additional specificities are listed below:- The negative impact of ORC on the primary ICE caused by the back-pressure was not considered. The back-pressure appears due to theresistance of the heat exchanger located in the exhaust gas duct (Yue(2014) [33]). For the investigated CS, in the opposite, a conservativeassumption was made to consider this resistance been compensatedby the Compressor. The validity of the assumption conforms to thepractical absence of the affecting on the primary engine due to theCompressor, which provides atmospheric pressure in the cross-sec-tion engine-CS.- Heat losses to the atmosphere are neglected for all components ofthe schemes.- Power consumption of the heat removal process in Condenser andgas Cooler (P )cooling is subtracted from the power of the turbine basedon the assumption of 17W per kW of removed thermal power cor-responding to the air heat sink (Antonelli (2016) [50]).- Subcooling in the Condenser is 1 °C to guarantee the absence ofvapor in the Pump.- Maximum evaporation temperature is at least 15 °C below the cri-tical temperature of the working medium to guarantee stable op-eration.- Minimal superheating temperature is equal to 5 °C with the samepurpose.- To consider the presence of the generator, the on-the-shaft power ofthe turbine-compressor unit of IBC and expander of ORC weremultiplied on the efficiency of the generator equal to 96%.Mechanical losses are also included in this coefficient.- In Aspen HYSYS, Peng-Robinson equation of state for flue gas,RefProp equation of state for organic fluids, UNIQUAC – for thermaloil, are chosen (Baccioli (2018) [51]).- Aspen HYSYS components are standard and have basic thermo-dynamic models; the basic equations for turbomachinery and heatexchangers are given in Appendix B.2.2.5. Efficiency of bladed machines in sub-atmospheric conditionsThe efficiency of Turbine and Compressor were assigned based onthe specific simplified approach. First, the efficiency of the machines forthe case of BC application was chosen from engineering practice. Then,BC and IBC machines of the equal gas flow rate were compared, and theFig. 4.

Economics assessment methodologyAn economic evaluation of the proposed scheme and its comparisonwith ORC based facility were provided with the use of LCOE approach.It estimates the electricity market price, which makes the projectprofitable with minimum acceptable parameters of investment returnon the period of project life. The formula for calculation of this factor isfollowing (Pili (2017) [52]):=+ = += +LCOECtot it Crit Er1 (1 )1 (1 )O M iiii& .(5)where Ctot is total capital investment cost, CO M& is operation andmaintenance cost (3% of Ctot), t is run-time of the plant in years(20 years), r stands for the discount rate (7%), ΔE is net energy gener-ated by the system over one year. For simplicity, single-tranche capitalinvestments from own funds are considered. Taxation, year-by-yeargrowth of CO M& , decrease of capacity, as well as insurance payments,are not included in the model. As so, ΔE and CO M& from the Eq. (5) areconstant. The interest rate is assumed based on typical values for thisfield of interest Gant Thornton LLP (2018) [53].The capital cost of components was calculated following the modulecosting technique (MCT) briefly but exhaustively described in Toffolo(2014) [54], for instance. Mostly, the cost-functions are taken fromTurton (2008) [47] besides the condenser, generators, and separator,which are not presented in this book. Sufficient formulas for the Con-denser and the Generator were taken from Smith (2005) [55] andToffolo (2014) [54] respectively following Lemmens (2016) [56] inthese approximations. The separator was assessed with an assumptionfrom Garrett (2012) [57]. Cost-functions for all components, as well asthe coefficients of these functions, are summarized in Appendix D. Tobring all values to current prices in the same currency ($ 2017 year),the official open historical data for CEPCI (CEPCI2017= 567.5) [58]and $/€ exchange rate [59] were used. The final total cost is derivedfrom the sum of the components cost with multiplication over 1.18corresponding to the system mounting costs, including the cost of TOL(Turton (2008) [47]).2.5. Optimization detailsThe optimization applied to the studied combined scheme and ORCenabled finding the best combinations of variable parameters for them.In the first part, the objective function was the system efficiency, and inthe second, economic part, it was LCOE. The constraints for the opti-mization were similar for both cases, but for the second one, resultingvalue of parameters usually laid aside from the limiting values as theygive high costs of components. Table 4 presents the constraints appliedin the optimizations. Minimal pinches were dictated by the technicalfeasibility of such HEs, minimum temperature till Tcr limits the eva-poration temperature in ORC and determine the operational stability ofthe system (Delgado-Torres (2007) [60]). The limit for the superheatingis chosen by relying on the commonly known technical practice.For the optimization, a standard Aspen Hysys optimizer was usedwith the BOX scheme and 2e-5 tolerance. “Maximum change periteration” parameter was varied in the range 0.5–3 to obtain globalextrema with higher precision.3. Results, sensitivity, and discussionsThis section presents the results. Firstly, the best working fluid forORC is identified based on the achieved system efficiency. Then, theresults of the system efficiency optimization are presented togetherwith LCOE optimization. The sensitivity analysis of the results is alsodemonstrated.3.1. Choice of the working fluid for the organic Rankine cycleThe comparison of the suggested combined scheme with ORC wasstarted by defining the optimal features of the ORC-based system si-mulated on a domestic model. Two configurations have been studied:regenerative and non-regenerative ORC. For the targeted application,the power of the ORC lies in the range suitable for the radial inflowturbines as an expander (Quoilin (2012) [44]). In his work, Quoilin hasTable 3Assumed efficiency of turbomachines in BC and IBC conditions.BC IBC ParameterTurbine 87% (2.1) 86% (2.1) T ( 'T )Compressor 85% (2.25) 83.7% (2.25) ( )C CTable 4Constraints for the objective functions of the optimization.Constraint ValueMinimum pinch HE-1, °C 30Minimum pinch Evap, °C 15Minimum pinch Condenser, °C 5Minimum pinch Regen, °C 15Minimum temperature till Tcr, °C 15Maximum oil temperature, °C 380Maximum superheating, °C 40K.A. Abrosimov, et al. Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 1000147also formulated the parametric limits for different types of ORC ex-panders, including radial turbines, for several working fluids. Threefluids with different level of critical temperatures (Tcr) were chosen,distinguished as low Tcr fluid – R245fa, medium Tcr fluid – pentane, andhigh Tcr fluid – toluene. Built model of the ORC considers Quoilin’slimits to define the possible ranges of evaporation and condensationtemperatures. Fig. 5 shows obtained results for these three fluids withthe employment of regenerative (ORC Reg) and non-regenerative(ORC) cycles.Table 5 shows the resulting parameters of the sys-optimized systemswith three studied fluids. The maximum generated power is demon-strated by regenerative ORC with pentane as the working fluid, al-though its critical temperature is far below the maximum availabletemperature of the cycle (380 °C). Interestingly, the use of tolueneyields a lower performance level, even though it has a much highercritical temperature which defines higher evaporation temperature andalso permits a lower relative auxiliary consumption because of thehigher energy density it carries (see Share of utilities in Table 5). Theexplanation of this fact is following: according to the Quoillin limita-tions the lowest condensation temperature acceptable for toluene(63 °C) is higher than the lowest available temperature of the system(around 25 °C); this implies that a lower amount of energy is receivedfrom the exhaust gas flow in comparison with the lower-temperaturepentane case. The cycle efficiency for toluene could be potentiallyhigher, but the smaller amount of energy transmitted to the cycle makesthe system efficiency of the toluene cycle lower than the pentane one. InTable 5, this difference in cycle efficiency is not observed because theoptimization has the overall system efficiency as the objective functionbut not cycle efficiency. In the work of Lecompte (2015) [5], the effi-ciency of the external irreversible Carnot cycle is introduced instead ofthe standard Carnot efficiency to make the preliminary estimation ofsuch WHR systems. For the same reason of the small amount of energytransmitted, the optimal condensation and evaporation temperaturesfor toluene are at the lower boundary of the prescribed range corre-sponding to the lower evaporation pressure. Meanwhile, this boundaryis determined by an acceptable condensation pressure (20 kPa) [44].Therefore, regenerative ORC with pentane as the working fluid is thebest competitor for the studied system due to its higher system effi-ciency and larger net output power.3.2. Results of the efficiency optimizationFig. 6 presents the performance of compared schemes operating inconditions of the exhaust in the temperature range around the nominaltemperature (520 °C). These results are obtained after sys optimizationfollowing the parameters and constrains mentioned in previous chap-ters. The left axis corresponds to the column-chat of system power, theright upper one – to the lines of efficiency in the top half of the figure,the right bottom one – to the relative difference in power for eachtemperature related versus non-regenerative ORC. On the column-chatof the power, the useful power is presented by the blue column (forORC) or the sum of the OBC (blue) and IRC (orange) column (for CS).The utilities are subtracted from the generated (gross) power of ORCand IBC in correspondence with the source of auxiliary consumption(ORC or IBC). For the nominal case, maximum observed values corre-spond to CS Reg with the Pnet= 151.7 kW and = 12.49%sys , whereasORC Reg has Pnet= 137.0 kW and = 11.3%sys . Relatively, CS Regovercomes ORC Reg on 10.6% and ORC without regeneration on28.2%.One may see that for all three temperatures the growth of efficiencyand power goes in the sequence: ORC, ORC Reg, CS, CS Reg.Additionally, with growing temperature, both absolute and relativeFig. 5.

Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 1000148advantage of the CS schemes are increasing. It can be observed at thecolumn-chart for power and the black stepped line in the bottom of chatfor relative power as well as at the comparison of slope coefficients ofthe linear approximation. It means that higher temperature is prefer-able for combined scheme mostly as a result of the growing efficiency ofIBC part. Performance data for the nominal temperature is presented inTable 6.3.2.1. Inverted Brayton cycle performanceOne interesting aspect of IBC behavior should be articulated sepa-rately. The influence of condensation of water before the compressorhave two opposite effects on the cycle performance. Due to the se-parator introduced before the compressor, the flow rate decreases forthe compressor and its work goes down. But on the other hand, en-thalpy of the gas decreases with the fall of the concentration of watervapor in the gas flow. These contrary impacts presented in more detailsin the next paragraph define non-trivial resulting dependence of IBCoperation from pressure ratio (see Fig. 7). Also, the size and the pres-sure drop of the cooler are depending on the condensation rate, but thiseffect was not considered in the present study.In Fig. 7, the effect of condensation on the gross power of IBC can beobserved. Typical view of such power curve for IBC (and BC, in fact) isthe convex curve with one absolute maximum. The high concentrationof water in exhaust gases, as well as the presence of critical value ofpressure (where the condensation ceases to occur according to thephysical properties of the particular mixture of exhaust gases) in theconsidered range of pressure ratio, are causing an appearance of twolocal maximums at the graph. For different TIT temperature, the ratiobetween maximums changes. For TIT=570 °C, the maximum in theno-condensation area prevails over the second maximum, in oppositewith the cases with the lower TIT temperatures. This fact does not affectthe optimal values of the pressure ratio in the optimizations of thestudied combined schemes. That is because of the domination of theORC over IBC in power generation. However, for the studies of IBCwithout any bottoming cycle, this result is essential.Relating to the right axis of Fig. 7, the line of the condensed watermass fraction for 35 °C temperature before the compressor shows thatthe critical value of pressure ratio is equal to about 2.9. It correspondsto the bend-point of the power curves. As the temperature before thecompressor does not vary in this study, only one line of condensedwater mass fraction is presented. Kennedy (2017) [61] discussed thisissue showing the results conform to ours. In this study, the pressureratio of a turbine (π’T) is an originally variable parameter, but not thecompressor pressure ratio (πC) as in some other works. As so, the secondhorizontal axis was added to Fig. 7 to ease the comparison with theworks of other researchers.3.3. Sensitivity assessment for the nominal caseThis section has the aim of studying the impact of assumed para-meters on the simulation results because, on the one hand, the as-sumptions in this work have been made based mostly on the generalengineering knowledge and values adopted in scientific papers so arenot very precise. On the other hand, the sensitivity is another aspect ofcomparison of combined scheme versus ORC. Fig. 8 presents the in-fluence of the change of different system parameters on system effi-ciency. The range of the analysis for each parameter is determined bythe reasonable possibility of such a range, so the ranges are different.First, Fig. 8 shows the effects of the change of the single componentparameter:• CS Reg- Compressor efficiency- Evaporator pinch- ORC Expander efficiency.• ORC Reg:- Pump efficiency- Evaporator pinch- ORC Expander efficiency.In addition, it shows the resulting changes in the system efficiencycaused by the simultaneous change of two parameters:• CS Reg:- Evaporator pinch and HE-1 pinch- Efficiency of IBC turbine and efficiency of ORC expander• ORC Reg:- Evaporator pinch and HE-1 pinchTable 6Calculated parameters of the four schemes (nominal conditions).Parameter ORC ORC Reg CS CS RegPgross, kW 142.70 158.50 170.30 175.80Pnet , kW 119.50 137.0 147.8 151.7sys, % 9.84 11.30 12.16 12.49cycle ORC. , % 15.54 21.52 15.58 19.36Π′T n/a n/a 2.13 1.94PT , kW n/a n/a 210.4 186.9πC n/a n/a 2.23 2.07PC , kW n/a n/a 143.8 124.4rv.Exp 43.93 34.8 43.35 39.7PExp, kW 142.7 158.5 103.7 113.3PPump ORC. , kW 6.69 6.52 4.75 5.27pCon out. , kPa 77.1 78.5 76.1 78.5pPump out. , kPa 2685.0 2688.0 2685.0 2688.0mw.f., kg/s 1.26 1.24 0.90 1.00moil, kg/s 1.36 1.11 1.02 0.95Tcond, °C 28.3 28.8 27.9 28.8Tevap, °C 181.8 181.8 181.8 181.8TExp out. , °C 124 145.3 99.7 107.8TCon in. , °C 124 44.3 99.7 44.9Ts h. ., °C 23 40 9 9.3Texh g out. . , °C 73.6 153.8 128.2 116.9ΔEv, °C 15 15 15 15UAEv, kJ/(K× s) 10.8 10.9 12.5 9.41ΔCon, °C 5 5 5 5UACon, kJ/(K× s) 77.5 70.56 56.7 56.9ΔRegen, °C n/a 15 n/a 15UARegen, kJ/(K× s) n/a 9.9 n/a 5.7ΔHE-1, °C 30 30 30 30UAHE 1, kJ/(K× s) 12.7 9.6 13.2 12.5ΔCooler, °C n/a n/a 15 15UACooler , kJ/(K× s) n/a n/a 9.3 11.7Fig. 7. IBC performance. Influence of water condensation.K.A. Abrosimov, et al. Energy Conversion and Management: X 3 (2019) 1000149The dependence of the system efficiency from components para-meters is mostly linear, as it can be observed in Fig. 8, besides the pumpwhose influence on the system efficiency drop accelerates with thedecreasing pump efficiency. Efficiencies of the working machines aremore influential than pinches of heat exchangers; however, it should benoticed that this comparison is not representative because of the dif-ferent nature of these parameters.The effect of the simultaneous change of turbomachinery effi-ciencies is substantial, especially for the combined scheme. For in-stance, a simultaneous 12.5% reduction of turbine and expander effi-ciency (the expander efficiency decreases from nominal 80% down to70%) leads to the about 20% drop in system efficiency. The addition ofthe effect from a similar decrease in compressor efficiency gives a dropof about 33%. The last statement can be implicitly observed in Fig. 8.One may add the drop from the compressor to the reduction from thesimultaneous decrease of turbine and expander efficiencies, what ispossible due to their additivity under the assumption of their linearity,which one may apply for this approximate estimation. ORC Reg doesnot have a parameter, which can influence it in such a way. Extremevalues of the graph in Fig. 8 are presented in Table 7.Sensitivity analysis of system behavior shows that with a certaindistribution of parameters of the components (mainly to say about ef-ficiencies of bladed machines) the advantage of CS Reg may be leveledwith ORC Reg or even turned opposite regarding system efficiency andLCOE.3.4. Results of the economic optimizationTo show the high-level comparative economic analysis, the LCOE-based optimization for potential investment projects based on the in-vestigated systems was performed for nominal inlet parameters. Themethodology of this approach and the assumptions of the model arepresented in chapter 3.3. Here, in Fig. 9, the obtained values of LCOEare presented as a function of CF of the facility. Table 8 shows theparameters of the optimized system for CF= 90%. For other capacityfactors, the optimization gave approximately the same values of variedparameters; so they are not presented in the table. The combinedschemes show an advantage over the ORC schemes in LCOE and theefficiency simultaneously, what to be explained with a high share of thecost of heat exchangers in the capital cost of the systems. The dis-tribution of expenses between system components is presented inFig. 10.In Table 8, the LCOE and system efficiency values are presentedamong other parameters of the LCOE-optimized results. System effi-ciency is expectedly lower than in case of the efficiency-optimization.Interestingly, CS Reg system shows the best LCOE, having the systemefficiency practically equal to the CS one. For ORS systems, the relationof LCOE and ηsys is not the same: the scheme with higher efficiency(ORC Reg) has better LCOE value. More than that, the ORC Reg schemehas LCOE minimum with the parameters close to the efficiency-optimalones; the efficiency is 0.36 absolute percent lower, whereas the effi-ciency of CS Reg lower at 1.4%, having a decrease from 12.49% to11.09%. These variations are connected with the balance between sizesof heat exchangers; hence, their costs and power production of thesystem. The values of pinches of heat exchangers, which implicitlyconnected with size: smaller pinch gives larger HE, are presented inTable 8. It can be noticed that all schemes besides the ORC Reg havehigher values of pinches than in the maximum efficiency case; this alsocorrelates with the scheme efficiency trend itself. Other parameterspresented in Table 8 gives more details of the system operation, en-abling to reproduce or compare the results.Fig. 8.

ConclusionThis study investigated a combined inverted Brayton plus organicRankine cycle (IBC-ORC), which, to the best of authors’ knowledge, hasnever been studied. As a bright example, heavy-duty internal combus-tion engines may be mentioned as, up to certain capacity, their nominalexhaust temperature reaches 600 °C. The suggested combined schemewas studied in two configurations: with regenerative ORC (CS Reg), andwithout regeneration (CS), for the number of temperatures in the range470–570 °C with the temperature considered as nominal equal to520 °C. As a benchmark for these schemes, a conventional ORC wasconsidered, also in two configurations: regenerative (ORC Reg) andnon-regenerative (ORC). The comparison of three common ORCworking fluids of different critical temperature levels: R-245fa, pentane,and toluene, has shown pentane as a better working fluid for the stu-died nominal case. Pentane has demonstrated an advantage in thesystem efficiency under limitations adopted from literature, which en-able to consider not only thermodynamics but the technical aspect aswell. The outcome of the work is the comparison of all above-men-tioned schemes after optimization of their system efficiency and afterLCOE-based (levelized cost of energy) optimization. The sensitivity ofthe results to the applied assumptions has been checked. Besides, theanalysis IBC has revealed a remarkable two-extremum dependence ofgenerated power from the pressure ratio caused by water condensationoccurring before the IBC compressor.Efficiency optimization has shown around 10% advantage of CS Regover the ORC Reg with absolute values equal to 12.49% and 11.3%correspondingly. This relative difference grows with the increase ofturbine inlet temperature. In the same time, the comparison of theLCOE-optimized scheme also demonstrates the 6.4% (for capacityfactor equals 0.9) advantage of CS Reg scheme but on the lower level ofefficiency (11.09% for CS Reg versus 10.94% for ORC Reg). The ob-tained value of LCOE for CS Reg equals 159.5 $/MWh versus 169.8 $/MWh for ORC Reg. That can be explained by the major role of heatexchangers in the capital cost formation in comparison with the cost ofmachines. Note that the sensitivity analysis has shown that obtainedvalues are considerably affected by the parameters of components,especially, by efficiencies of turbomachinery, which may considerablyaffect the performance of both systems. However, the outcomes of thescheme assessment are favorable enough to give room for further re-search of this technology.Declaration of Competing InterestNone.Table 8Parameters of schemes LCOE-optimized for 90% CF.Parameter ORC ORC Reg CS CS RegLCOE, $/MWt 181.0 169.8 166.0 159.5Cap.cost, $/kW 1215 1140 1115 1065Pgross, kW 141.3 154.1 152.8 152.9Pnet , kW 118.2 132.9 134.7 134.8sys, % 9.73 10.94 11.08 11.09π’T n/a n/a 2.87 2.90PT , kW n/a n/a 281.2 282.7πC n/a n/a 3.07 3.09PC , kW n/a n/a 213.6 215.2rv.Exp 46.4 35.1 44.3 39.8PExp, kW 141.3 154.1 85.2 85.4PPump ORC. , kW 6.61 6.32 3.96 3.92pCon out. , kPa 75.8 78.0 76.2 77.3pPump out. , kPa 2700 2687 2687 2687mw.f., kg/s 1.25 1.10 0.75 0.74moil, kg/s 1.08 1.20 0.97 0.96Tcond, °C 28.0 28.5 28.0 28.3Tevap, °C 181.9 181.9 181.9 181.9TExp out. , °C 101.4 145.0 101.7 110.2TCon in. , °C 101.4 59.8 101.7 71.6Ts h. ., °C 5 40 6.3 11.2Texh g out. . , °C 78.0 144.5 189.8 166.1ΔEv, °C 19.6 16.6 30.6 29.2UAEv, kJ/(K× s) 10.81 10.83 10.03 10.89ΔCon, °C 5 5 5 5UACon, kJ/(K× s) 78.06 70.83 46.9 44.72ΔRegen, °C n/a 30.92 n/a 44.1UARegen, kJ/(K× s) n/a 5.33 n/a 1.22ΔHE-1, °C 30 30 30 30UAHE 1, kJ/(K× s) 12.7 10.08 10.89 10.28ΔCooler, °C n/a n/a 15 15UACooler , kJ/(K× s) n/a n/a 3.1 3.31Fig. 10.

The purchase cost may be defined as:= ×C C FBM b.c. BM (D.1)where the Cb.c. – “base conditions” cost calculated as:= + × + ×lg(C ) K K lg(A) K (lg(A))b.c. 1 1 1 2 (D.2)and A is a capacity or size parameter of equipment, FBM – bare module factor equals to:= + × ×F B B F FBM 1 2 P M (D.3)where FM – “material factor” peculiar for each material different from the basic one; FP – “pressure factor” equals to:= + × + ×lg(F ) C C lg(p) C (lg(p))P 1 1 1 2 (D.4)For some equipment, the bare module factor is given, and the bare module equipment cost should be calculated with the Eq. (D.1).To calculate total module cost which conceder mounting and axillary devices including TOL, the following formula from Turton (2008) [47] isapplied:= ×C 1.18 CTM BM (D.5)Table D.1 presents all applied coefficient and alternative equations been used in some cases.Table D.1Coefficients for the components cost-functions.Component Function argument K1K2K3B1B2FM C1C2C3FBMIBC Turbine• Turton (2008) [47]: radial turbine• $ 2001P (kW) 2.24761.4965−0.1618––– –––3.5ORC expander• Turton (2008) [47]: radial turbine• $ 2001P (kW) 2.24761.4965–0.1618––– –––3.5Compressor• Calise (2007) [76]: radial compressor• € 2003P (kW) CBM=91562× (PComp/445)^0.67 –HE-1• Turton (2008) [47]: fixed tube• $ 2001A (m2) 4.3247–0.3030.16341.631.661.81 Fp=1.25 –Condenser• Lemmens (2016) [56]• $ 2000Heat flow (kW) = ×C 12300 ( )b cPHE heat. ..500.76 0.961.211.81 Fp=1.25 –(continued on next page)K.A.
