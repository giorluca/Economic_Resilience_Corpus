I explored one aspect of social-ecological change in the context of an Alaskan human-Rangifer system, with the goal ofunderstanding household adaptive responses to perturbations when there are multiple forces of change at play. I focused on householdsas one element of social resilience. Resilience is in the context of transition theory, in which communities are continually in a processof change, and perturbations are key points in the transition process. This case study of Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska, USA, contributesto the understanding of cultural continuity and household resilience in times of rapid change by using household survey data from1978 to 2003 to understand how households adapted to changes in the cash economy that came with oil development at the same timeas a crash in the caribou population and state-imposed limits on caribou harvests. The research illustrates that households are resilientin the way they capture opportunities and create a new system so that elements of the old remain while parts change.Key Words: Anaktuvuk Pass; resilienceINTRODUCTIONThis research explores one aspect of social-ecological change inthe context of an Alaskan human-Rangifer system (HRS), withthe goal of understanding how households respond toperturbations during times of rapid change. It is a case study ofthe community of Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska, USA, from themid-1970s to 2003. In this study, resilience is defined as a system’scapacity to maintain its fundamental structure and functioningdespite perturbations (Cumming et al. 2005, Folke 2006, Kofinaset al. 2010, Wilson 2012). I focus on households as one elementof social resilience (Adger 2000) while recognizing that the studycommunity is reliant on ecosystem services (Berkes and Jolly 2001,Folke 2006). I view resilience in the context of transition theory(Wilson 2012), in which communities are continually in a processof change. Disruptions, perturbations, stresses, or shocks are keypoints in the transformation process (Wilson 2012). I examineperturbations and follow Turner et al. (2003), who defineperturbation as a disturbance that originates beyond the system.In contrast, stresses originate within the system. McCarthy andMartello (2005) and others (Folke 2006, Wilson 2012) note thatchanges can have both positive and negative effects and can createopportunities for innovation and development. Adaptations arestructural changes in response to external circumstances (Younget al. 2006). In this study, adaptations are changes that householdsmake in their productive activities to minimize risk to theirresources and livelihoods (Berkes and Jolly 2001, McCarthy andMartello 2005).  In the case of Anaktuvuk Pass, a community with a subsistence-cash economy, households moved from relying primarily onecosystem services to being connected to the global economywhile remaining reliant on the local ecosystem. During the studyperiod, households diversified, and movement was from a simpleto a more complex economic society (Wilson 2012) whilemaintaining essential elements of the former. The embeddedassumption that complex society is a more resilient societyremains an open question (Timmerman 1981, Turner et al. 2003).Adaptive responses of households allowed them to persist duringthe period of perturbation. Following the perturbation,households incorporated wages from jobs into a subsistence-based economy to create a mutually reinforcing mixed economicsystem in which elements of the old remained while the partschanged (Anderies et al. 2004).  Perturbations had two forms: restrictions on caribou hunting andincreased job opportunities. I identified the mid-1970s as theperiod of perturbation for the community of Anaktuvuk Pass. Ashort but severe disruption to harvests came in 1976, when theAlaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) imposed limitson caribou hunters in response to a perceived crash in the cariboupopulation. During this same period, oil production started atPrudhoe Bay, Alaska, bringing jobs and transfer income toAnaktuvuk Pass residents. Nearly all residents work for the NorthSlope Borough (NSB) rather than directly for oil companies. Theborough was established in 1972 and began to levy taxes on oilinfrastructure located on borough land. To generate cash quickly,the borough began to issue bonds, and over time used tax revenueto repay them. Bond revenue provides funding for majorinfrastructure improvement projects (Morehouse et al. 1984). Theprojects preferentially hire borough residents.  During the time when caribou harvests were restricted,households incorporated wages from jobs into the social-economic system. Households returned to caribou harvestingafter restrictions were lifted, but also maintained income-earningjobs. I view households as integral to the system, highly dynamic,and as both responding to formal institutional change affectingthe HRS (Kofinas and Russell 2004) and greater global economicchange. In the North American context, transformation of asocioeconomic system is defined as a transition from semi-nomadic caribou hunters to a hybrid economy mixing subsistencehunting and fishing, transfer income, and wages. The existenceand durability of a mixed economy in rural Alaska has been welldocumented by other researchers (VanStone 1960, Kruse 1991,Kirkvliet and Nebesky 1997, Magdanz et al. 2004, Wolfe 2004,Wolfe et al. 2009). I also report community-level demographicmeasures identified by Adger (2000) as indicators of resilience.My research questions were: What adaptive strategies didhouseholds use in response to hunting limits imposed in 1976?How can sustained caribou harvests and sharing be seen as1Institute of Social and Economic Research, University of Alaska AnchorageEcology and Society 20(4): 8http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol20/iss4/art8/household-level proxies for resilience? Are there indicators ofcommunity-level resilience corresponding to household changes?Have households in this HRS undergone a transition?METHODSStudy areaIn this section, I describe the study area, its residents, and itsfundamental structure, and identify essential elements that, ifimpaired, would threaten its continued existence (Timmerman1981, Anderies et al. 2004, Cumming et al. 2005). For AnaktuvukPass, the essential elements are household caribou hunting,cultural continuity, and community-level demographic stability.Anaktuvuk Pass is located in the Brooks Range of Alaska’s NorthSlope, USA, and is situated in a caribou migration corridor (Fig.1). Caribou migrate in the spring and fall (Brower and Hepa 1998).The 2010 community population of 324 is predominantly Iñupiat(Inuit of Alaska). The community is accessible by air in summerand by air or snow machines in winter.Fig. 1. Map of Alaska, USA, showing Anaktuvuk Pass.Hall et al. (1985) provide a historical overview of communitysettlement, reporting that Iñupiat caribou hunters have beenliving and hunting caribou in the interior part of what is now theNorth Slope borough since the 1400s. Although caribou make upthe largest share of subsistence harvests, local residents alsoharvest fish, birds, moose, sheep, plants, and berries. Since theAnaktuvuk Pass area was first inhabited in the 1800s, residentsrelied primarily on a single resource for subsistence needs, makingthe community potentially more vulnerable to disruptionscompared to multi-resource communities on the coast (Adger2000). In the early 1900s, the caribou population collapsed, andIñupiat people either died of starvation or moved away (Hall etal. 1985). Moving away from the Anaktuvuk Pass area is evidenceof mobility as a resilience characteristic. Mobility has beenrecognized as a key resilience strategy for households prior topermanent settlements (Berkes and Jolly 2001, McCarthy andMartello 2005).  By the 1920s, the caribou population began to recover, and 10years later, people returned to hunt during winter. During the1940s, several families returned, and by 1950, the population was66 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, no date). At that time, store-boughtfoods were not available, and people traveled by dog team. In1968, oil was discovered at Prudhoe Bay, and decades of rapidchange followed. In 1970, 99 people lived in Anaktuvuk Pass, andall but two were Alaska Native (U.S. Census 1970, summary file4 [U.S. Bureau of the Census 1996]). The population more thandoubled to 203 by 1980 (U.S. Census 1980, summary file 3 [U.S.Bureau of the Census 2008]), and has increased steadily since then(U.S. Census 1990 and 2000, summary file 3 [U.S. Bureau of theCensus 1993, U.S. Bureau of the Census 2002]). Today,approximately 9 out of 10 residents are Alaska Native (U.S.Bureau of the Census 2012).  With oil production and the creation of local and regionalgovernments came job opportunities and wage earnings. Localand borough government jobs allowed for subsistence leave andscheduled work around community calendars. In 1980, 1990, and2000, no one from Anaktuvuk Pass worked at Prudhoe Bay(measured by travel time to work using U.S. Census summary file3 computer files), possibly because oil production takes place inan industrial enclave, with two weeks on and two weeks off, andwith no accommodations for subsistence. No data are availablefor 2010 because the U.S. Census discontinued use of the longform, which included questions about income, education,occupation, travel time to work, migration, disabilities, andlanguage.  At about the same time as economic development was gainingmomentum, big changes were coming for caribou harvests.Statewide economic growth and institutional development led totension between state government and traditional subsistencecommunities (Morgan 1976, Morehouse et al. 1984, Spaeder2005, Spaeder and Feit 2005, Dayo and Kofinas 2010). Until the1970s, there were no seasonal restrictions or bag limits for caribou.In 1976, the State of Alaska began to implement managementplans for caribou by imposing per-hunter limits and seasonalclosings; this was a shock to the people of Anaktuvuk Pass, whorelied on caribou as their primary food source and food sharingas a cultural tradition. ADFG officials cited a catastrophic dropin the population of the Western Arctic Caribou herd as the reasonfor the limits (Fig. 2). According to ADFG, the herd numbered242,000 in 1970 and declined to < 100,000 by 1976 (Morgan 1976).However, there was a common opinion by local native huntersthat the population census was flawed and therefore inaccurate(Kruse et al. 1998).Fig. 2. Population estimates for the Western Arctic Caribouherd. Source: Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group(2003), Woodford (2012).Ecology and Society 20(4): 8http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol20/iss4/art8/Caribou is the key subsistence species for Anaktuvuk Passhouseholds. The absence of animals disrupted subsistencepractices. Subsistence involves cultural values and attitudes,mutual respect, sharing, resourcefulness, and an understanding(both conscious and mystical) of the intricate interrelationshipsthat link humans, animals, and the environment (Alaska NativesCommission 1994). In Anaktuvuk Pass, as in other rural Alaskacommunities, harvest sharing is not only a cultural tradition, butis also a result of efficient production. ADFG subsistence harvestdata show a consistent pattern of harvest sharing in AnaktuvukPass. Approximately one-half  of households reported hunting,and nearly all hunters reported sharing their harvests(Community Harvest Subsistence Information System data files,ADFG 2013). This behavior is consistent with subsistence harvestpatterns elsewhere in rural Alaska. In an analysis of subsistenceharvest data across rural Alaska, Wolfe and Walker (1987) foundthat ~30% of households account for 70% of the harvest, withwild foods distributed to other households in the community, apattern known as the 30:70 rule. Writing about Anaktuvuk Pass,Brower and Opie (1996) describe community feasts wheresuccessful hunters distribute their harvest to other people in thecommunity. For Anaktuvuk Pass, a relatively small number ofhunters traditionally produce most of the harvest. This practicemagnified the hardship of government-imposed per-hunter baglimits.Data sourcesData sources for proxy measures of resilience come from fourhousehold censuses, two household sample surveys (a randomlyselected subset of households), and ADFG subsistence harvestsurveys. The ADFG surveys ask a series of questions about eachspecies. In the case of caribou, the questions are: Did yourhousehold use caribou? (“Use” includes using meat for humanand animal food, as well as hides, antlers, and other caribou partsfor clothing, art, and other purposes). Did your householdattempt to harvest caribou? Did your household harvest caribou?Did your household give away any caribou? Did your householdreceive any caribou? ADFG survey methodology is described indetail by Fall (1990).  Household survey data include only Alaska Native households,defined as having at least one adult who self-identifies as AlaskaNative. The NSB conducted a sample survey in 1978 and censusesin 1988, 1993, 1998, and 2003. Sample survey data were alsoobtained from the 2003 Survey of Living Conditions in the Arctic(SLiCA; Kruse et al. 2008), which is a household survey ofaboriginal people in the Arctic. The survey included aboriginalhouseholds in the United States (Alaska), Canada, Greenland,Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia (Chukotka and the KolaPeninsula); the Alaska and Russian portions of the survey werefunded by the National Science Foundation (http://www.arcticlivingconditions.org/). Martin (2010) discusses the surveyin more detail.  The 1978 NSB survey is interesting because it covers the timewhen caribou hunting limits were in place and includes questionsabout how households adapted to the limits. However, it did notask people if  they hunted caribou in 1977 because of sensitivityand confusion about the regulation. Nearly all surveys includedhousehold demographics, employment, income, housing, huntingand fishing activities, and subsistence food consumption. SLiCAand the NSB 2003 census took place in the same year. Wherepossible, I used data from the NSB census because it containsinformation on 92 households, whereas the SLiCA sample is 10households.RESULTSCaribou harvest level is a measure of household resilience. Surveydata indicate that hunting restrictions disrupted harvests and foodsupply (Table 1). Of the households in the NSB 1978 survey, 71%reported that they hunted caribou prior to the imposed limits.Nearly all households (96%) reported that they had less foodduring the restrictions than in the prior period, and 96% reportedthat the caribou regulations were the reason why. Hall et al. (1985)wrote that in 1976, hunters chartered an airplane to find caribou.However, this strategy did not overcome the problem of bag limitsand was very expensive. During the time of the ban, householdsadapted to imposed limits by eating more store-bought food, byeating less meat, or both, and households did not substitute othersubsistence foods for caribou (Table 2). Hall et al. (1985) alsonoted that there are few good fishing locations nearby. Table 1. Food consumption characteristics for Anaktuvuk Pass1990–1994 and 2006.

Except for 1994, the number ofanimals harvested has been fairly constant over the 16 years. Inaddition to counts of animals harvested, the 2006 survey alsocontained information about households. Nearly everyone in thecommunity, i.e., 92% of households, reported using caribou.  Cultural continuity is another measure of household resilience. Iused data on household participation in a broad range ofsubsistence activities over time, household consumption ofsubsistence foods, and harvest sharing as indicators of culturalcontinuity. Households reported that they maintained subsistenceactivities, consumption, and sharing over the 25-year period (e.g.,fishing, hunting caribou, gathering berries, sewing skins, trapping,and hunting marine mammals; Fig. 3). A high percentage ofrespondents reporting that they participated in marine mammalharvests in 2003 is due to the small sample size; two householdsreported hunting for seals. Participation levels in non-caribousubsistence activities were similar in 1978 to subsequent years,indicating that in 1978, people did not shift from caribou harveststo other activities. In 1978, no one reported that they participatedin whaling, walrus, or seal hunting. This is consistent with the lackof alternative subsistence resources nearby, the expense ofequipment and travel, and lack of knowledge specific to someharvests (e.g., marine mammals). It is also consistent with theobservation by Wolfe (2004) that culture determines which specieswill be harvested. For the 12 months prior to each survey, > 50%of households reported that one-half  or more of their subsistencefood came from their own harvests (Table 3). This share has notdecreased over time. In addition, since 1978, ≥ 71% of householdsreport that they gave subsistence food to other households, and >80% of households reported that they received food over theprevious 12 months (Table 3).

By 1980,45 people had wage jobs, and per capita income had risen toapproximately $11,000 USD (U.S. Census 1980, summary file 3computer file [U.S. Bureau of the Census 2008]). Compared to1970, employment increased sharply during the 1970s andremains at high levels, with nearly 9 out of 10 working-age peopleholding jobs during the previous 12 months (Table 4). Combiningcaribou harvest information (Table 2) and employment data(Table 4) from 1978 suggests that during the caribou shortage,people went to work and used wage earnings to buy more food.In the years following 1978, people continued to work after thehunting restrictions were lifted (Table 4).Table 4.

Once the huntingrestrictions were lifted, households returned to caribou huntingbut retained jobs, marking the emergence of a hybrid mixedsubsistence-cash economy, which extended beyond earnings fromtrapping to includes wage and salary earnings. The move to amixed economy was not so much the result of hunting restrictionsas it was of a significant increase in job opportunities.Increasingly, subsistence hunters need cash to help support theirtraditional way of life (Kruse 1991, Kirkvliet and Nebesky 1997,Ecology and Society 20(4): 8http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol20/iss4/art8/Berman 2009). Cash also supports modern conveniences that havebecome part of Iñupiat life. Rifles have replaced bows and arrows,snow machines have replaced dog teams, and freezers improvefood storage. Jobs provide money for equipment, fuel, andammunition. Technological advances have also made hunting andfishing more efficient, allowing people to live in villages near jobsand schools, and hunt and fish on the weekends or in their sparetime (Berman and Kofinas 2004). Taken together, increasedemployment, improved but more expensive equipment, andcontinued subsistence indicate that households are using some oftheir wage earnings for subsistence activities. By 1978, ~57% ofhouseholds participated in the wage economy and subsistencehunting and fishing, similar to later years (Fig. 4).Fig. 4. Household mix of jobs and subsistence activities forAnaktuvuk Pass. Source: North Slope Borough census 1978,1988, and 1993 (unpublished data), Survey of living conditionsin the Arctic 2003 (unpublished data).As oil and tax revenues began to flow to the state of Alaska, theNSB, and the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC),households began receiving dividend payments, adding to the mixof cash and subsistence. Beginning in 1972, ASRC began payingshareholder dividends. In 2009, ASRC paid out approximately$5700 (USD) per person to 9600 shareholders (State of Alaska2011). In 1982, households in Anaktuvuk Pass began receivingadditional income when the Permanent Fund Dividend programbegan to make annual payments to every Alaskan from oil revenueearnings (Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation 2013,unpublished report).Population stabilityFollowing Adger (2000), I used stable age structure and slow butcontinued population growth as indicators of community levelresilience. Anaktuvuk Pass is more than five-times as large as itwas in 1950, and 9 out of 10 people are Alaska Native. Even duringthe mid-1970s, the population increased despite the drop incaribou availability. This is in sharp contrast to the turn of thecentury, when people left the area after the caribou populationcrashed. Unlike some communities in which nearly all the youngAlaska Native women have left (Martin 2009), there are nearlyequal numbers of young adult men and women in AnaktuvukPass (Fig. 5). Relatively large numbers of 10–19-year-olds indicatethat, if  conditions remain the same (including the cost of living),the population could be stable in future years, and there areenough young adults to maintain caribou harvest traditions.Fig. 5. Age and sex structure of the Anaktuvuk Passpopulation, 2010. Source: U.S. Census Bureau (2012: summaryfile 1 computer file).DISCUSSIONI presented modest empirical evidence to support a simple idea:changing adaptive strategies helps households rebound fromperturbations. Adaptive strategies that promote the ability torebound involve incorporating new opportunities whilemaintaining key cultural and social functions. In this case,households adapted to a perturbation, i.e., hunting restrictions,by taking advantage of job opportunities and substituting store-bought for harvested foods. Following the perturbation,households incorporated earnings from jobs into the subsistenceeconomy and returned to caribou harvesting and associatedsharing traditions, and at the same time, they created a highlyintegrated mixed cash-subsistence economy. During the time spanof this study (1978–2010), while households were adapting tochange and incorporating new opportunities, the population ofAnaktuvuk Pass continued to grow, and the age-sex structure ofthe community remained stable. The response to the disruptionin 1970 was different from the outmigration and starvation of theearly 1900s, possibly because of the availability of wage earningsto maintain food supply. The mixed economy connectshouseholds of Anaktuvuk Pass to the global economy whilecontinued caribou hunting and harvest sharing maintains theirconnection to the HRS. This research shows how householdsadapted to disturbances from the combination of worldwideeconomic, ecological, and state-initiated institutional changes.The households of Anaktuvuk Pass have demonstrated resiliencein the sense that they incorporated new resources to maintainRangifer harvest while increasing material well-being.Households have taken advantage of the opportunities that camefrom rapid change to manage vulnerability and risk.  According to Cumming et al. (2005), one of the aims of applyingresilience theory to empirical case studies is to identify strategiesfor continued resilience. The lessons from Anaktuvuk Pass in theEcology and Society 20(4): 8http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol20/iss4/art8/1970s may be, as Holling (1973) writes, to maintain flexibilityabove all else. The work of Ostrom (1990) and others (Anderieset al. 2004) indicates that the best way to maintain flexibility is toallow for those who have the highest stakes in the system to havethe strongest voices in regulation. Continued pressure on the HRSin Anaktuvuk Pass comes from climate change related events andchanges in the global economy (Kofinas and Russell 2004).Increased fire frequency and intensity could damage lichen-dominated habitats on which caribou rely (Joly et al. 2011). Risingfuel prices are driving up transportation costs as well as rapidincreases in the cost of living (Fried and Robinson 2008). Highfuel prices and other costs have put pressure on households bymaking hunting more expensive while forcing them to rely moreon subsistence foods (Brinkman et al. 2014). How these factorswill affect households in the HRS are subjects for future research.Responses to this article can be read online at: http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/issues/responses.php/7586Acknowledgments:I extend a special thank you to the anonymous reviewers of thismanuscript.LITERATURE CITEDAdger, W.
