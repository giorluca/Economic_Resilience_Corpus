This article is published with open access at Springerlink.comAbstract This paper uses individual-level longitudinaldata on working-age Finns to examine the health effects ofeconomic fluctuations during a period of economic decline(1989–1996) and recovery (1997–2007) in Finland. Weused a nationally representative, longitudinal sampleformed by linking population, employment and mortalityregisters (n = 698,484; 7,719,870 person-years). Weimplemented a region fixed-effect model that exploitswithin-regional variations over time in the unemploymentrate to identify the effect of economic fluctuations onmortality, controlling for individual employment transi-tions. Unemployment rates increased from 5.2 % in 1989to 19.8 % in 1996, declining gradually thereafter andreaching 9.7 % in 2007. Results indicate that these largefluctuations in the economy had no impact on the overallmortality of most working age Finns. The exception washighly educated men, who experienced an increase of 7 %(Rate ratio = 1.07, 95 % confidence interval 1.04, 1.10)for every one-point increase in the regional unemploymentrate during the period 1989–1996 due to increased mor-tality from cardiovascular disease and suicide. Thisincrease, however, was not robust in models that used theemployment to population ratio as measure of the econ-omy. Unemployment rates were unrelated to mortalityamong females, lower educated men, and among any groupduring economic recovery (1997–2007). For most Finns,we found no consistent evidence of changes in mortality inresponse to contractions or expansions in the economy.Possible explanations include the weak impact of therecession on wages, as well as the generous unemploymentinsurance and social benefit system in Finland.Keywords Economic recession  Unemployment Mortality  Educational status  RegistriesIntroductionA growing literature suggests that job loss is associatedwith poorer health and higher mortality [1–6]. Somestudies based on aggregate data, however, suggest thatpopulation health improves during economic contractionsand deteriorates during economic expansions [7–12].Recently, studies have started to examine this questionusing individual-level data and have found that there is a‘contextual’ protective effect of economic recessions overand above the increased mortality effect of individual jobloss [13, 14]. In addition, they suggest that recessions mayhave heterogeneous effects by increasing mortality amongthe unemployed while reducing mortality among theemployed [14, 15].Electronic supplementary material The online version of thisarticle (doi:10.1007/s10654-016-0152-8) contains supplementarymaterial, which is available to authorized users.& Mauricio Avendanomauricio.avendano_pabon@kcl.ac.uk1 Department of Global Health & Social Medicine, King’sCollege London, East Wing, Strand Campus, Strand,London WC2R 2LS, UK2 Department Social and Behavioral Sciences, Harvard T.H.Chan School of Public health, Boston, MA, USA3 Population Research Unit, Department of Social Research,University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland4 Centre for Health Equity Studies (CHESS), StockholmsUniversitet and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden5 The Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research,Rostock, Germany123Eur J Epidemiol (2017) 32:77–85DOI 10.1007/s10654-016-0152-8Most studies that have used individual-level data arebased in the United States, but existing evidence from othercountries suggest that observed reductions in mortalityduring economic downturns may not hold for some Euro-pean countries such as Sweden [16, 17]. A potentialexplanation is that social benefit programmes and benefits,which are typically more generous in the Nordic countriesthan the United States, might protect populations againstthe mortality effects of economic fluctuations. The majoreconomic turmoil in Finland during the last two decadesoffers a unique opportunity to explore this question. In thelate 1980s and early 1990s, Finland experienced one of themost severe recessions in post-war Europe [18]. Unem-ployment rates increased from 3.1 % in 1989 to 16.6 % in1994 [19]. The depression years were followed by a periodof slow but sustained economic recovery, with unemploy-ment rates declining steadily and reaching 6.3 % in 2008,before starting to increase in 2009 (Supplementary Fig-ure 1 in online resource) [19]. Surprisingly little researchhas examined how mortality changed in response to thesedramatic changes in the Finnish economy [18].This paper examines whether fluctuations in regionaleconomic conditions were associated with changes inmortality among working-age men and women in Finlandfrom 1989 to 2007. We exploit variations in unemploymentrates as a measure of changing economic conditions acrossFinnish regions. While most previous studies have usedaggregate mortality rates, individual-level data enables usto control for individual characteristics and examineheterogeneity in the impact of unemployment according topersonal characteristics. In particular, we are able toexamine whether there is a ‘contextual’ effect of economicfluctuations on mortality once changes in individualemployment status are controlled for. We also examinewhether the effect of economic downturns on mortalitydiffers for individuals with different educational level. Thisquestion is motivated by evidence suggesting that theeffects of recessions on labour market outcomes are borndisproportionally by lower educated male workers, partlydue to the demographic composition of workers acrossindustries and occupations differentially affected byrecessions [20]. Our study focuses on the years just prior tothe Great Recession which included a deep economicrecession (1989–1996) and subsequent years of economicrecovery (1997–2007) in Finland.MethodsData and variablesData came from a nationally representative longitudinalcohort of the Finnish population formed by linkagebetween continuously updated population, employmentand mortality registers using unique personal identificationnumbers available to all permanent residents. Due to data-protection regulations, we cannot obtain data for the totalpopulation. Therefore, we obtained from Statistics Finlandan 11 % random sample of the total population in1987–2007. Regulations concerning deceased individualsare less strict, so we obtained a 80 % sample of all deathsin this period. This oversampling of deaths was performedin order to increase statistical power. To account for thediffering sampling probabilities in the design, all analysesused weights provided by Statistics Finland, which gavelower weight to persons who died and higher weight topersons who survived. Our sample was restricted to indi-viduals aged 25–65 years in order to focus on the popu-lation in the labor force. The sample comprised 698,484persons and 7,719,870 person-years.MortalityData on mortality came from the national cause-of-deathregister of Statistics Finland and included dates and causesof death. Causes of death were classified into broad cate-gories based on the 9th (1989–1995) and 10th (1996–2007)versions of the International Classification of Diseases(ICD) as follows: (a) cardiovascular disease (ICD9 codes2891–2892, 390–4254, 4258–434, 436–4376, 4378X–444,447–459/ICD10 codes I00–I425, I427–I99); (b) cancer(140–208, 2386, 2733/C00–C97); (c) suicide (E9500–E959/X60–X84, Y870); (d) traffic accidents (E800–E848/V01–V99); and (e) alcohol-related mortality (291, 303,3050, 3575, 4255, 5353, 5710–5713, 5770D–5770F,5771C–5771D, 7607A, 7795A, E860/F10, G312, G4051,G621, G721, I426, K292, K70, K860, K8600, 0354, P043,X45).Regional unemployment ratesAs indicator of economic conditions we used the unem-ployment rate by region of residence and year for theperiod 1988–2007. Unemployment rates for age 15–74were estimated based on our individual-level data onemployment status at the end of each year. Yearly region ofresidence for each individual was based on 20 NUTS3-regions ranging from a few thousand to over one millioninhabitants. Each region included several municipalities,but in sensitivity analysis, we found similar results whenusing municipalities as units of analysis. A possible con-cern is that some individuals live and work in differentregions. However, data from Statistics Finland indicatesthat around 94 % of employed individuals live and workwithin the same region (Statistics Finland, personalcommunication).78 M. Avendano et al.123Educational level and employment status changeEducational level was classified into basic or unknown(approximately 9 years or less), secondary (12 years),lower tertiary (13–14 years), and upper tertiary (15?years), based on the highest degree obtained. Registeredemployment status was measured on the last day of eachyear. For each year t of mortality follow-up we linkedinformation on regional unemployment rate at the end ofthe previous year (t - 1) and individual-level employmentstatus change during the previous year, i.e. from the end ofyear t - 2 to the end of year t - 1. Data were availablesince the last day of 1987, so the earliest changes inemployment status were assessed between end-of-year1987 and end-of-year 1988. We first categorized yearlyemployment status into employed, unemployed or out ofthe labor force. We then constructed a variable to indicatechange in employment status between years t - 2 andt - 1, comprising six groups: (a) stable employment, ifemployed in both t - 2 and t - 1; (b) job loss, if employedin t - 2 but unemployed in t - 1; (c) newly employed, ifunemployed in t - 2 and employed in t - 1; (d) long-termunemployed, if unemployed in both t - 2 and t - 1; and(e) out of workforce, if out of the labor force in either t - 2or t - 1. Those with unknown employment status in yeart - 2 were classified in a separate category.Methods of analysisFollowing previous studies [9, 12, 21], we applied a region-fixed-effects model to examine how fluctuations in theregional economy were associated with short-term changesin mortality over the period 1989–2007. SupplementaryFigure 2 (online resource) shows that unemploymentincreased from approximately 1988 to 1994 and subse-quently declined in all regions in Finland, but themagnitude of these changes differed across regions. Ifunemployment causally influences mortality, we wouldexpect regions that experienced larger changes in unem-ployment to experience larger changes in mortality rates.Our identification strategy thus relies on this regionalvariation in the magnitude of increases or decreases inunemployment across regions. Based on Poisson regres-sion, our main model specification was as follows:LogðDijtÞ ¼ b0 þ b1Ujt1 þ b2 Wijt2 Wijt1 þ b3Ait1þ Rjt1 þ Zt þ eijtwhere D is vital status of individual i in region j at time t, Uis the regional unemployment rate for region j at end ofyear t - 1, Wijt2 Wijt1 is the change in employmentstatus for individual i in region j between the end of yearst - 2 and t - 1, A represents age, Rjt1 is a region fixed-effect, Z is a year fixed-effect, and e is the error term.Region fixed-effects control for time-invariant factorsthat differ between regions while year fixed-effectscontrol for factors that vary uniformly across regionsover time. We estimated parameters using Poissonmaximum likelihood models with person-years as offsetvariable. Robust confidence intervals were calculated byclustering standard errors at the regional level in order toaccount for the interdependence of observations withinregions.To assess educational differences in the impact of theeconomy on mortality, we introduced interaction termsbetween educational attainment and all covariates in themodel. One of our key aims was to examine whether effectsof fluctuations in the economy during a period of economicdecline differed from those in a period of economic growth(Fig. 1). Therefore, we implemented separate models forthe period 1989–1996 and 1997–2007. Analyses wereconducted in STATA version 11 and incorporating weightsto account for oversampling of deaths.Fig. 1 National unemploymentrates (ages 15–74) and age-standardized mortality rate(ages 25–64), Finland,1989–2007.

Avendano et al.123with a doubling of the mortality risk relative to those whoremained employed, while those who regained employ-ment had a higher risk of dying than those continuallyemployed. Those in long-term unemployment and out ofthe workforce had also larger mortality than those withstable employment. The relationship between individualemployment transitions and mortality was very similaracross periods. Controlling for individual employmenttransitions, a change in regional unemployment rate wasunrelated to mortality for both men and women. Supple-mentary Figure 3 (online resource) summarizes estimatesfor the unemployment rate for five broad causes of death.There was no association between unemployment rates andany cause of death for men. Among women, mortality fromcancer (RR 1.02, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.03) increased whenunemployment rose in the period 1989–1996, but there wasno association for other causes of death. In models thatused the full period from 1989 to 2007 and incorporatedinteraction terms between each variable and a periodindicator (results not shown), we found no evidence ofsignificant differences in the impact of unemployment rateson mortality between the two periods (p[ .05).Table 3 shows estimates from a model that incorporatesinteractions of educational level with all individual andregional-level variables. For brevity, we only presentinteraction terms with regional unemployment rate. Resultsreveal some heterogeneity by educational level during theperiod of deep economic recession (1989–1996) amongmen. In particular, a one-point increase in the unemploy-ment rate was associated with a 7 % (RR 1.07, 95 % CI1.04, 1.10) increase in all-cause mortality for men withtertiary education, while there was no association for lesseducated men, or for any educational group among women.Figure 2 disaggregates results for the period 1989–1996 forspecific causes of death among men. Estimates suggest thatthe increase in mortality for highly educated men duringyears of rising unemployment was driven by an increase inmortality from cardiovascular disease and suicide.Sensitivity analysesWe carried out analyses to examine whether unemploy-ment rates up to 6 years earlier had a lagged effect onmortality (Supplementary Table 1, in online resource). Wefound no evidence that lagged unemployment ratesincreased overall mortality in either period. In a model thatexamined interactions with education, we found that anincrease in unemployment rates in year t - 2 during thedeep economic recession (1989–1996) was associated withan increase in mortality among highly educated men (RR1.05, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.09), but this effect was not observedfor years t - 3 to t - 6 (Supplementary Table 2, in onlineresource).A possible bias may arise if regional unemploymentrates are correlated with regional trends in other factors thataffect mortality. We therefore replicated all models withdetrended regional unemployment rates using a Hodrick–Prescott Filter (HP) [22], which separates the cyclicalcomponent of a time-series from its general trend by esti-mating the annual deviation from a smoothed trend curve,thus controlling for regional linear trends. We used asmoothing parameter of 100, but results did not changewith alternative parameters. Results from all models usingthis detrended version of unemployment rates are presentedin Supplementary Figures 4–6 (online resource). Resultswere very similar to those observed using crude unem-ployment rates, with one exception. For the years1989–1996, increased unemployment was associated withTable 3 Interaction between educational level and regional unemployment rates, employment status change and all-cause mortality, Finland,1989–1996 and 1997–20071989–1996 1997–2007Males Females Males FemalesRR 95 % CI RR 95 % CI RR 95 % CI RR 95 % CIUnemployment rate 1.07 (1.04, 1.10) 0.99 (0.91, 1.07) 0.98 (0.94, 1.02) 1.04 (0.99, 1.09)Educational levelUpper tertiary 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00Lower tertiary 2.39 (1.78, 3.21) 0.79 (0.50, 1.24) 2.14 (1.41, 3.25) 2.18 (1.43, 3.34)Secondary 5.77 (4.57, 7.29) 1.87 (1.22, 2.88) 3.18 (2.38, 4.26) 4.30 (3.05, 6.05)Basic or unknown 14.18 (11.25, 17.88) 7.98 (5.50, 11.58) 11.07 (7.72, 15.88) 22.52 (12.74, 39.81)Lower tertiary*unemp. rate 0.91 (0.87, 0.95) 1.03 (0.93, 1.14) 1.04 (0.98, 1.10) 0.97 (0.90, 1.04)Secondary*unemp. rate 0.92 (0.88, 0.96) 1.03 (0.95, 1.13) 1.03 (0.99, 1.06) 0.97 (0.92, 1.02)Basic/unknown*unemp. rate 0.93 (0.90, 0.96) 1.03 (0.95, 1.12) 1.03 (0.99, 1.08) 0.97 (0.92, 1.02)All models include age, employment status change, region, year fixed-effects, and interactions of educational level with all variablesAre some populations resilient to recessions?

Thiseffect among men was driven by a decline in mortalityfrom traffic accidents (RR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.83, 1.01) andcancer (RR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.93, 1.01) when unemploymentrates rose, although these declines were not significant.Supplementary Figure 5 (online resource) shows that theinteraction between unemployment rate and educationallevel remains significant in detrended models, with highlyeducated men suffering disproportionately from increasedmortality when unemployment rises.To control for secular declines in mortality throughoutall regions (Fig. 1), our models included year fixedeffects. However, there maybe region-specific mortalitytrends not accounted for by year fixed effects. To examinethis, we replicated models incorporating regional lineartrends in addition to year fixed effects (SupplementaryTable 3, in online resource). Results from these modelswere very similar to those in our original specification inTable 2.We carried out sensitivity analyses that incorporatedhousehold income in the model. We used data fromhousehold taxable income at time t - 1, which comprisedgross income of all household members, including wages,capital income, and taxable income transfers, but excludedtax-exempted social benefits, adjusting for inflation [23]and household structure using the OECD scale [24].Results incorporating the log of household income in themodels are summarized in Supplementary Table 4 (onlineresource). As expected, higher household income wasassociated with lower mortality among both men andwomen. However, controlling for income had no impact onthe association between unemployment rates and mortality.In addition, countercyclical mortality among tertiary edu-cated men in the recession period was robust to controllingfor income (results not shown).While unemployment rates might best reflect the impactof the recession in the early 1990s, we carried out sensi-tivity analyses using the employment to population ratio,an alternative labour market measure that refers to thenumber of employed individuals divided by the size of theworking-age population (those aged 15–64) in each region.Results are summarized in Supplementary Tables 5 and 6(online resource). Overall, for the majority of groups, wefind no association between employment to populationratios and mortality. However, among males during the1989–1996 period of recession, an increase in the regionalemployment to population ratio–which signals animprovement in the regional economy-was associated withan increase in the regional mortality rate (IRR 1.04, 95 %CI 1.03–1.05), an effect driven by men in the two lowestlevels of education (basic and secondary). In all othergroups and periods, regional employment rates had noeffects on mortality.A final consideration in our analysis are the self-em-ployed, who cannot be distinguished from employed indi-viduals in our yearly data. In sensitivity analysis, however,we incorporated self-employment data available from5-year censuses in 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005,extrapolating information for the inter-census years basedon the latest census. We found that self-employed men hada 15–20 % higher all-cause mortality compared with theemployed in both periods, however, controlling for self-employment had no impact on our estimates of the effectsof regional unemployment rates on mortality. AmongFig. 2 Impact of one-point increase in the regional unemploymentrate on cause-specific mortality, Finland, males, 1989–1996. Allmodels include age, employment status change, region and year fixed-effects, as well as interactions of educational level with regionalunemployment rates, age, employment status change, region and year82 M. Avendano et al.123women, self-employment was not associated with mortal-ity. In addition, the increasing mortality for tertiary edu-cated men in the recession period was robust to controllingfor self-employment.DiscussionBased on individual-level registry data, our study suggeststhat, for most Finns, there is no independent ‘contextual’effect of economic downturns on mortality. Higher edu-cated men experienced increased mortality when unem-ployment rose during the deep economic recession of theearly 1990s, due to increased mortality from CVD andsuicide. However, this finding was not replicated whenusing the employment to population ratio as a measure ofeconomic conditions. We found no consistent evidence thateconomic fluctuations influence female mortality.Are Finns resilient to economic recessions?The most remarkable finding in our study is that, unlike theUnited States and some other OECD countries[7–12, 25, 26], we found no evidence that an increase inregional unemployment rates is associated with a decline inthe regional mortality rate. This is true even for the deeprecession in 1989–1996. Our results are partly in line withother studies from Scandinavian countries that have failedto replicate a decline in mortality during recessions. Basedon individual-level data, a study in Sweden found thatoverall mortality increased during economic recessionsamong men, while there was no effect among women [16].Another study in Sweden found that recessions were asso-ciated with increased incidence and mortality from acutemyocardial infarction among prime-working age Swedishmen [17]. Recent evidence also suggests that the well-documented relationship between business cycles andmortality for the US [8, 9, 21] may not hold for more recentperiods [27]. Based on data from 1979 to 2009, Ruhm foundthat the impact of recessions on some causes of deathreported in earlier work [8, 9, 21, 28–30] shifted and becamenull using more recent data [31]. Overall, these findingssuggest that the relationship between business cycles andmortality may be period and context specific [32].There are at least two potential social policy mecha-nisms that may explain the resilience of Finns to economicfluctuations. The first mechanism refers to the limitedimpact of the recession on the incomes of Finns, oftenattributed to the large role of unions in collective agree-ments related to nominal wages. Union density in Finlandwas 72 % in 1988–1994, but collective agreements coveredover 95 % of the workforce [33, 34]. Since unions have toagree on wage cuts suggested by employers [35, 36],Finnish workers have a strategic advantage in wagenegotiations. As a result, nominal wages were frozen by thecollective agreements over the period 1992–1993; the rateof inflation was slower than expected and there was acontinuation of a small but positive wage drift. This meansthat for most Finns aggregate real wages remained largelyunchanged in 1992–1994 [35], which may explain theweak effect of increasing unemployment on mortality.Wage changes regulated by unions, however, onlybenefitted job stayers, while most of the burden of therecession fell on workers who lost their jobs. We found,however, no independent effect of rising unemploymentrates on the mortality of displaced workers. A possibleexplanation comes from the generous unemployment ben-efit system in Finland, which is particularly generous interms of replacement rates and duration of compensationrelative to other EU countries [37]. During 1983–1994,Finland combined a system of high unemployment benefitreplacement rates–approximately 63 % for a period of2 years—with relatively late referral to labour marketactivation [38]. Finnish workers were thus protectedagainst large income losses from unemployment during therecession, and as a result, Finnish households sufferedeconomic losses that were smaller than those predictedbased on the decline in GDP [38]. This hypothesis issupported by recent evidence suggesting that generousunemployment benefits can offset the impact of increasingunemployment rates on suicide [39], as well as the impactof job loss on self-rated health [40].We found some evidence that the deep economicrecession increased mortality from suicide and CVD forhighly educated Finnish men. We note that this increase isnot only driven by job loss as we controlled for individualemployment transitions. Several studies have shown thatsuicides increase when the economy contracts[9, 39, 41–44]. These studies often interpret this effect asthe result of economic strain arising from unemploymentparticularly for economically constrained families in lowersocioeconomic groups [41, 42, 45], but it is not clear howthis would apply to highly educated men. A possibleexplanation is that, in the context of generous unemploy-ment benefits for economically constrained workers,recessions increase psychosocial stress particularly amonghighly educated workers, due to their higher careerexpectations, the potentially larger income losses andscaring effects of job loss for their future careers and long-term economic well-being [46]. Likewise, evidence sug-gests a link between psychosocial stress and mortality fromcardiovascular disease, particularly for ischemic heartdisease [47–51], for which we observed a particularlymarked increased in response to increasing unemployment.Nevertheless, the increase in mortality among highly edu-cated men should be interpreted with caution, as it was notAre some populations resilient to recessions?

We identified the impact of therecession out of variations in the change in unemploymentrates across Finnish regions. A potential concern is that allregions experienced similar increases in unemployment asa result of the crisis, and there was therefore little differ-ence between ‘treated’ and ‘control’ regions. On the otherhand, while all regions indeed experienced rising unem-ployment, the size of this increase ranged from 13 % pointsin the region of Varsinais-Suomi to 17.7 % points in Päi-jät–Häme, a difference of 4.7 % points (SupplementaryFigure 2, online resource). Nevertheless, we note that ourstudy compares regions all of which experienced risingunemployment, an approach that may underestimate theimpact of economic downturns on mortality.Our study focused on the period from 1989 to 2007 anddid not cover the more recent increases in unemploymentfollowing the great recession. We restricted the analysis tothis period because our data were only harmonized up to2007. In addition, our intention was to focus on the period oflarge increasing unemployment in Finland that occurred inthe early 1990s, and the subsequent gradual decline inunemployment that ended in 2008, and after which unem-ployment started to increase again (Supplementary Fig-ure 1, online resource). While examining this period wouldbe of interest, it is unlikely that our results would changemuch by incorporating the more recent period given therelatively smaller fluctuations in unemployment rates.We were not able to distinguish involuntary job loss dueto business closure or mass lay-offs from unemploymentdue to health or other reasons. Estimates for individualunemployment, therefore, cannot be causally interpreted asthey combine both the potential causal effect of unem-ployment with the impact of reverse causation or omittedconfounding variables [32]. Nevertheless, our focus was onthe impact of regional unemployment rates, a measure ofthe business cycle that is not correlated with individualcharacteristics. The assumption of this approach is thatshort-term fluctuations in unemployment rates are primar-ily driven by changes in economic output and have less todo with changes in the health composition of regions[7–12, 25, 26], which we have no reason to believe chan-ged in the aggregate during the period of study, e.g., therewas no major epidemic or sudden event that would havesystematically impoverished the health of regions andlowered local economic productivity. Based on this ratio-nale, we believe our estimates capture the impact ofpresumably exogenous changes in the regional economy onthe health of individuals in each region.ConclusionThe large increase in unemployment during the early 1990sand subsequent economic growth had little impact on themortality of working-age men and women in Finland.These findings contradict results from some studies thathave found declines in mortality during periods ofincreasing unemployment. We speculate that weak effectsof economic fluctuations on wages, paired with a system ofgenerous unemployment and other social benefits, mayhave been effective in buffering the impact of the eco-nomic collapse on the mortality of Finns.Acknowledgments This work was supported by the EuropeanResearch Council (ERC) (Grant Number 263684), the NationalInstitute on Aging (Grant Numbers R01AG037398, R01AG040248),and the Academy of Finland.Compliance with ethical standardsConflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflict ofinterest.Ethical approval The present study is based on retrospective anal-ysis of registry data.
