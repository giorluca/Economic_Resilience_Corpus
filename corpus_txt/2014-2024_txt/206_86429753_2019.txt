ABSTRACT 
Considering two countries that are the subject of a comparative study (DR Congo and Nepal), we 
have defined a number of criteria on the basis of which eighteen indicators divided into five 
dimensions (commercial, socio-economic, fiscal, financial and spherical) have proved important 
for measuring and assessing the economic resilience of low-income countries. The min-max 
standardization technique allowed us to derive standardized coefficients between 0 and 1 on the 
basis of which we performed arithmetic average operations in order to identify sub-indices 
related to each dimension. Thus, five sub-indices were determined and their geometric average 
allowed us to determine the economic resilience index. Also, the min-max technique as well as 
the principal component analysis allowed us to determine the dimension that contributes more to 
the variability of our data. At the end of our analyses, it turns out that the economy of Nepal over 
the period from 2003 to 2017 is more resilient than that of DR Congo. This resilience capacity is 
largely explained by the trade dimension for these two countries. 
Keywords: Economic resilience, composite index, sub-index 
RESUME 
Considérant deux pays faisant l’objet d’une étude comparative (RD Congo et Népal),  nous avons 
défini un certain nombre de critères sur base desquels dix-huit indicateurs répartis en cinq 
dimensions (Commerciale, socio-économique, fiscale, financière et sphérique) se sont avérés 
importants pour mesurer et évaluer la résilience économique des pays à faible revenu. La 
technique de normalisation min-max nous a permis de dégager des coefficients normalisés 
compris entre 0 et 1 sur base desquels nous avons effectué des opérations de moyennes 
arithmétiques pour dégager les sous-indices liés à chaque dimension. Ainsi, cinq sous-indices ont 
été déterminés et leurs moyenne géométrique nous a permis de dégager l’indice de résilience 
économique. Aussi, la technique min-max ainsi que l’analyse en composante principale nous a 
permis de déterminer la dimension qui contribue le plus à la variabilité de nos données. Au bout 
de nos analyses, il s’avère donc que l’économie du Népal sur la période allant de 2003 à 2017 est 
plus résiliente que celle de la RD Congo. Cette résilience est en grande partie expliquée par la 
dimension commerciale pour ces deux pays.

INTRODUCTION 
Because the economic resilience literature is too limited for low-income countries, the overall 
goal of our thesis is to describe the key variables to be considered in assessing and measuring the 
economic resilience in low-income countries. Specifically, this thesis aims on one hand, to 
develop a procedure for computing the economic resilience index in low-income countries. On 
the other hand, it provides a methodological framework needed to identify the dimension or the 
indicator that makes the economy more resilient in low-income countries in order to derive 
economic policy implications and thus provide recommendations for improving the resilience 
capacity for these countries. 
With the exception of some fragile and conflict-affected countries, low-income countries 
experienced strong and sustained economic growth until 2014 despite the global financial crisis 
in 2008 (IMF, 2014). This positive trend hit a roadblock in 2014, with drop in global commodity 
prices. Commodity exporters experienced a marked drop in export revenues, soon reflected in 
budgetary difficulties and a fall-off in growth. With commodity prices set to remain low for the 
foreseeable future, macroeconomic development in the low-income countries continue to be 
heavily influenced by how countries are responding to the new world shocks, which makes the 
economies of low-income countries more exposed to shocks and less reassuring about their 
sustainability (IMF, 2015). 
However, Countries and more particularly low-income countries are subject to a wide variety of 
economic shocks, sovereign debt crises, commodity price fluctuations or volatility in the world 
economy. These shocks can increase risk and uncertainty for households, investors and 
governments, and when sufficiently large, can trigger crises and throw economies off their 
growth path and then lead to long-lasting periods of stagnation (Sánchez et al. 2015). From a 
policy perspective it is therefore important to understand the major factors that condition a 
country’s resilience to face the adverse economic shocks. And so, a first question comes to mind: 
What are the effective indicators for assessing and measuring the level of economic resilience 
in low-income economies? 
There is no consensus on the measurement of economic resilience. For instance, the choice of 
variables, the aggregation procedure and the way to assign weights to variables differs among 
composite indices of economic resilience in the literature (equal weight for Briguglio et al., 2009; 
2 
 
 
Guillaumont, 2010 versus unequal weights for Adrianto & Matsuda, 2004). In addition, studies 
on resilience do not generally refer explicitly to sustainable development even though some of 
them use this aspect. For illustrative purposes, in many works like those of Atkins et al. (2000) 
and Briguglio et al. (2009), the economic dimensions have been emphasized, but the other 
dimensions like the social; the environmental are implicit or even lacking. 
Nonetheless, in the literature several variables are developed to assess and measure economic 
resilience and many of them relate to developed and emerging countries. Taking into account the 
theoretical and empirical lessons of the various scientific works proving the need for the low-
income countries to strengthen their economic structures in order to be able to resist from the 
different shocks, we will consider indicators of trade dimension, socio-economic dimension, 
fiscal dimension, financial dimension and political dimension for assessing and measuring the 
economic resilience of low-income countries. 
We use the term low-income country (34 countries) to refer to those countries that have a low per 
capita income ($995 or less) (World Bank 2018). Unlike the DR Congo (located in Central Africa 
with 2,345,000 km² and an estimated population of 81,339,988 inhabitants), Nepal (147,181 Km² 
is 16 times smaller than the DR Congo and with an estimated population of 29,304,998 
inhabitants) is a landlocked Himalayan country in south Asia. Nevertheless, in the illustrative 
case we assess and measure economic resilience in these two low-income countries and not 
geographically close. One country is considered a large country (DR Congo) and the other as a 
small (Nepal). Thus, a comparative study is made between these two states in terms of their 
economic resilience capacity. Hence the question:  which of the DR Congo and Nepal Republic 
is more economically resilient? 
Furthermore, in this work, we use the process of calculating a composite index of economic 
resilience based on the philosophy of sustainable development in order to identify the 
variable/indicator (or dimension) that  contribute to make the low-income economies more 
resilient (here, we consider two countries namely the DR Congo and Nepal). Hence the question: 
In which economic dimension are the strengths of each country (DR Congo and Nepal) in 
terms of resilience?  
Having already all the data relating to the chosen variables for the two countries which constitute 
illustrative cases of our study, we will re-scaling all the variables based on the min-max 
3 
 
 
normalization technique before to evaluate the composite resilience index for both countries by 
applying arithmetic operations based on the simple arithmetic average and geometric average. 
The principal component analysis will also allow us to describe the variable that contributes more 
to make the economy more resilient. 
The last fifteen years ago (2003-2017) is the time limit of our analyzes in the sense that this 
period corresponds of course to the years in which several low-income countries have 
experienced sufficient performance in terms of economic growth supposed to have improved 
their economic resilience capacity. 
Contributing to a new methodology for assessing and measuring economic resilience in low-
income countries is the principal motivation by addressing the present thematic. Personally, this 
research allows me to have important theoretical and methodological tools for assessing and 
measuring economic resilience and especially for low-income countries. On the Theoretical 
level, it is to highlight the questions on the evaluation of economic resilience and especially for 
low-income countries. To this end, no economic theory has succeeded in removing the 
indeterminacy surrounding this issue of economic resilience in particular the appropriate 
methodology to measure it in terms of index.  
Regarding the operational interest, in the context of this study, it is really a question of knowing 
the state of the economy for the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as that for the Nepal 
Republic, namely whether they are resilient and at what levels. Also, we believed that by 
approaching this study, we put at the disposal of the future researchers a working instrument 
which can help them to carry out diversified studies in the economic resilience field. At the end, 
researchers can use it as a solution track related to their problem and scientific research relating 
to the economic resilience of low-income countries. 
In addition to the introduction and conclusion, our thesis is structured around four chapters. The 
first chapter, after having laid down the necessary theoretical bases, details the work forming the 
empirical basis of our study. The second chapter is dedicated to the methodological approach 
adopted in order to quantify the economic resilience index. The results of our analysis are 
presented in the third chapter which is also the part dedicated to the interpretation of the results. 
Finally the fourth chapter is devoted to the principal findings and the implications of our results 
in terms of economic policies.

First Chapter. LITTERATURE REVIEW 
In this chapter, we present theoretically key concepts related to our topic, in particular the basic 
notion of resilience as well as other concepts (such as economic shock and composite index) 
needed in order to be able to apprehend the theoretical framework of our study. Just after the 
theoretical review we detail extensively the empirical lessons drawn from the existing literature 
on the assessment and measurement of economic resilience in low-income countries. 
Section 1. THEORITICAL FRAMEWORK 
In this section, we discuss about the different theoretical foundations related to our subject. First, 
we will present the concept of economic shock before raising the subject of economic resilience 
which represents the key issue of our work. Finally, it is important at the end of this section to 
introduce a little bit the concept related to composite index that will allow us in the third chapter 
of this thesis to better quantify the economic resilience and at the same time to be able to conduct 
the comparative study between low-income countries and more precisely Nepal and DR Congo, 
the two illustrative cases in our thesis. 
1.1.1. Economic shock 
An economic shock is an unexpected or unpredictable event that affects an economy, either 
positively or negatively. It refers technically to an unpredictable change in exogenous factors 
(Lütkepohi 2008). Shocks can be of three kinds: shocks caused by internal factors such as 
political crisis, social unrest, which may downturns in the national economy; shocks caused by 
economic shocks affecting a particular sector/industries that constitute an important component 
of the region’s export base (prices fluctuations) and other external shocks (a natural disaster, 
closure of a military base, movement of an important firm out of the area, etc.). 
The shocks are not mutually exclusive; a country or regional economy may experience more than 
one simultaneously. Not all shocks cast an economy substantially off its prior growth path. When 
a shock occurs that does not cause the country or the region to be thrown off its prior growth path 
(to experience an economic downturn), we consider it as the region “shock-resistant”. If the 
region or the country is adversely affected by the shock and it returns to its prior growth path 
within a relatively short period of time, we consider it “resilient”. If it does not, we consider it 
“non-resilient” (Hill et al. 2012).

1.1.2. The term resilience 
More than a metaphor and less than a theory, the resilience is a conceptual framework 
(Swanstrom 2008). The first known use of the term “resilience” in science was by Webster in the 
field of classical physics in 1824. Resilience initially was defined as the ability of a material to 
return to its initial condition in terms of size and shape after deformation due to a compressive 
shock (which exert pressure on a phenomenon in order to reduce its harmful impact)
1
. Today, the 
term resilience means to rebound or to leap back (Reggiani 2013). 
According to Foster (2007), there are several conclusions about attributes of resilience. First, 
resilience applies not only to a system as a whole, but to individual system elements, such as the 
infrastructure, the information, the physical environment, the civic organizations, the governance 
and the economic systems. Second, a system that is resilient on one element may not necessarily 
be resilient on another. Third, resilience can be developed in terms of understanding and 
measurement, depending largely on the framework in which the concept is being considered. 
Fourth, resilience leads to exploring a perfectly associated framework (vulnerability) that is more 
concerned with the sensitivity of the system or one of its components to external pressures. 
Vulnerability is not seen as the state opposed to resilience. A system can be resilient in some 
dimensions and at the same time vulnerable in others even though the resilience of one dimension 
may imply less vulnerability for the other dimension of the system (Seeliger & Turok 2013). 
1.1.2.1. Resilience Versus stability, sustainability, prevention and vulnerability 
Some concepts like stability, sustainability, prevention or vulnerability are not to be confused 
with resilience (Brinkmann et al. 2017). 
A. Resilience versus stability 
There’s a difference between the two concepts. In fact, the resilience of a system is not to be 
equated with its stability (in the sense of a low degree of volatility) (Rose 2009). Even a system 
that undergoes considerable short-term fluctuation as the result of a shock can prove to be 
resilient if, following a phase of instability; it reaches a new equilibrium with performance 
comparable to that displayed before the shock.

B. Resilience versus sustainability 
These two concepts differ with respect to their temporal dimension. Sustainability considerations 
from ecology to economics are defined on the basis of very long time horizons, typically 
encompassing several generations. Sustainable systems have the prospect of fulfilling their 
functions even after the passage of decades (or centuries). Sustainability is also often a reaction to 
gradual changes. Observations of resilience are undertaken over a shorter period of time. The 
systemic disruption under consideration is of a shorter-term and more abrupt nature, and the 
question of processing the shock, if necessary, refers at most to the medium term. As compared to 
resilience, sustainability is the more comprehensive concept; resilience represents a necessary but 
not sufficient condition for sustainability. 
C. Resilience and prevention 
As far back as the word’s origin, the consideration of resilience does not take into account 
statements regarding the probability of sudden adverse events, but rather addresses the effects 
and processing of such events. This understanding permeates applications in all disciplines. 
Consequently, analyses of resilience should be conceptually distinguished from issues of crisis 
origin or prevention. At the core of resilience strategy is not the prevention of crises, but rather 
the attempt to cope with a crisis one which is unavoidable, or one whose probability can be 
influenced only to a limited degree as well as possible. This includes also proactive measures in 
the run-up to a possible crisis. However, these are not oriented toward averting the crisis, but 
rather toward coping with it more effectively through preparatory measures. 
D. Resilience versus vulnerability 
It is quite difficult for many of the scientists to establish the difference between resilience and 
vulnerability. Indeed, these two terms too should not be equated. Vulnerability is the broader 
term, encompassing the extent to which a system is exposed to crisis (Rose 2009), and is thus 
minimized through successful crisis-prevention measures. By contrast, the degree to which 
resilience has been achieved can be assessed only with respect to a crisis. A system in which 
crisis-prevention measures have been successfully carried out reduces its vulnerability. However, 
it does not necessarily thereby improve its resilience (for the case in which the now-less-probable 
crisis event nevertheless takes place).

Table below shows a comparison between vulnerability and resilience on different scales. The 
contrast suggests that resilience is more concerned with the capacity to recover from a disaster 
within a short time and with no outside assistance, while vulnerability is the property of resisting 
the stress caused by a natural hazard.

1.1.2.2. Towards Economic Resilience 
For a long time, economic resilience did not receive the level of scientific attention as it is 
attracting today. Martin (2012) provides an interesting review of work on resilience from an 
economic viewpoint; in particular he describes how resilience was regarded in the broader 
economic literature as a fuzzy concept. In literature, the term Economic Resilience has been used 
in at least three senses relating to the ability to recover quickly from a shock; to withstand the 
effect of a shock and to avoid the shock altogether (Briguglio et al. 2006). 
Today, the relative resilience of different economies would be measured in terms of their 
susceptibility to being moved off their equilibrium paths and their response times of recovery to 
equilibrium. It is difficult to reconcile the notion of resilience with the idea of economic 
evolution. The implication is that the more resilient is a country or a regional economy, the less it 
would change over time, even in the face of various shocks (Simmiea & Martin 2010). As we can 
see in Figure 1(a) below, a shock or disturbance moves an economy off its equilibrium growth 
path, but the assumption is that self correcting forces and adjustments eventually bring it back 
onto that path. This is not the case for other figures (1(b), 1(c) and 1(d)) even if each case shows 
8 
 
 
a certain degree of resilience but the resilience capacity in the three last cases (1(b), 1(c) and 
1(d)) is less than the capacity resilience in the first case (1(a)).

evolutionary approach, p 3. 
However, being two concepts which are not mutually exclusive, it is less consistent to talk about 
economic resilience without addressing the point about economic vulnerability. Several authors 
consider economic vulnerability to be a pre-shocks characteristic and economic resilience the 
outcome of a post-shocks response (Cutter et al. 2008). Thus, economic resilience is often seen as 
a way to reduce economic vulnerability and a more resilient economic system is seen as a system 
with less vulnerable economic sub-systems (Pendall et al. 2012).

The link and difference between these two concepts appears to be ambiguous and is not well 
defined in the economic literature. The figure below shows the inter-connections between 
economic systems, economic vulnerability and economic resilience, through their evolutionary 
dynamics and exposure to shocks. The shock plays a central role; when a shock hits the economic 
system, either in its entirety or one of its parts, it causes an economic loss or gain that is more or 
less pronounced according to the economic vulnerability and economic resilience characteristics 
of the system considered as a whole.

The loss/gain changes the original structure of the economic system and result in a new 
equilibrium. The new equilibrium is the motivation for the introduction of “adaptive” strategies 
by policy makers (e.g., policy measures aimed at mitigating an economic loss, etc.). A good 
preventative action would be policy to enhance resilience (or to reduce vulnerability). However, 
this action would also affect the spatial-economic system. Thus, vulnerability and resilience 
might be regarded as concepts that play a key role in modifications to the spatial economic 
system’s structure.

1.1.3. The composite indexes 
The resilience concept is perceived as a network of dependent relationships among the variables 
and among dimensions. A composite index is an aggregation of a set of individual indicators that 
gives evidence for a multifaceted problem using mathematical or computational methods. The 
justification for a composite index lies in its fitness for the phenomenon to be measured and its 
simplicity (Pedrazza & Katsinis, 2018). The resulting big picture of composite indexes is easier 
to interpret than a battery of many separate indicators. Nevertheless, economic resilience index as 
a composite index reduce the multifaceted reality to a single value. In this work, we will calculate 
this composite index through some mathematical techniques in order to be able to quantify the 
economic resilience of low-income countries by using a group of variables. 
1.1.3.1. Criteria for rejecting a variable to compute a composite index 
Many authors provide guidelines or manuals regarding desirable properties of statistics and 
indices (see for example Farrugia 2007; IMF 2003; OECD 2008). Briguglio (2003) proposed 
criteria for rejecting component variables when constructing a composite index. These criteria 
include variables that are not relevant, are beg the question, and are redundant. As part of our 
work, these criteria are scrutinized with more attention. 
A. Irrelevance variables 
Variables (or indicators) that are not relevant to the phenomenon called to be measured should 
obviously be excluded. But there are instances where non-relevance of a variable is not 
immediately obvious. For example, in an economic vulnerability index, which is aimed at 
measuring the causes of economic vulnerability (capturing features of an economy that render it 
exposed to external shocks), GDP volatility or export volatility should not feature as components 
of the index. The reason for this exclusion is the fact that volatility can be a manifestation not 
only of vulnerability but also of some other causes (As for instance, an inherently highly 
vulnerable economy may not be volatile if it builds economic resilience, and conversely an 
economy which is not high vulnerable may be volatile if its economic governance is weak). 
B. Begging the question 
This means assuming beforehand what is intended to be proved. For example, introducing 
country size as a component of the index when the objective is to test whether the small countries 
11 
 
 
(For example: Nepal) are more vulnerable than large countries (For example: DR Congo) is not 
acceptable, because this situation would bias the results. This is one more reason for not take into 
account the variable “size of country” in our thesis. 
C. Redundancy 
A set of variables that are highly correlated could replicate each other or capture the same 
tendencies. In practice, decisions to know which variables to exclude on the basis of this 
argument are not easy to take, among other things, this situation can require a correlation 
coefficient threshold, above which the variables would be considered as too correlated and 
therefore possibly capturing the same phenomenon.  
However, highly correlated variables may be representing by different factors that convey more 
or less the same message. Testing for statistical correlation and retaining only those indices which 
are not highly correlated with each other may result in rejecting something which should be 
accepted. For this reason, the redundancy problem requires that statistical analysis should be 
complemented by a qualitative analysis of the variable itself. The fact of being selective in the 
choice of variable components may also be desirable for other reasons, such as parsimony. 
1.1.3.2. Criteria for adopting a variable to compute a composite index 
Briguglio (2003) in his study identified positive attributes of variables used to construct a 
composite index especially in the economic sphere, namely the simplicity, the transparency, the 
reproducibility, the comparability and the affordability. These are the essential qualities that a 
variable can have in order to compute a composite index and avoid any bias that may be involved 
in the calculation. We believe that we can take into account these criteria in order to select 
variables and build our index (economic resilience index) in the low-income countries. 
A. Simplicity 
The main advantage of simplicity is the fact that the variable is easy to understand by 
stakeholders, decision-makers and other users. The simplicity allows to correctly interpreting the 
variable and facilitates the work of making proposals in terms of economic policies. A variable 
with this quality (simplicity) must contribute effectively to the construction of the composite 
index (here it is the economic resilience index), which is also an essential element that makes the 
interpretation of a phenomenon simple and understandable. 
12 
 
 
B. Transparency 
This attribute requires that the methodology used should be clearly explained by the institution or 
the persons who implemented the variable and that the data used by the author of the variable 
should be available to those who wish to assess the variable. That is one more reason to have a 
methodological basis well provided in a study in order to build a composite index. 
C. Reproducibility 
This attribute requires transparency, in that it should permit replication of the variable by users or 
assessors of the variable, including stakeholders and policymakers, for the purposes of evaluation 
and validation. It’s just an attribute that demonstrates the need to have a variable that does not 
give some doubt about its estimate. 
D. Comparability 
A variable which is intended to measure an incidence across different subjects (such as countries) 
should, of course, be suitable for such comparisons. In the case of the resilience index, which is 
intended to compare economic resilience across countries, the variables selected as components 
of this index should be available across countries and should be measured in a homogenous 
manner. Preferably, the data should be collected as a matter of routine in line with the 
information required for a particular country. This may explain why cross-country economic 
indices are easier to construct than environmental indices and as internationally comparable 
economic statistics are easier to obtain than internationally comparable environmental statistics. 
E. Affordability  
This attribute implies that the procedure used must not be excessively time-consuming and the 
data needed must be relatively easy to obtain and to process. In this regard there is usually a 
trade-off between what is purely theoretical and what is practical. A variable known in advance 
that the data will be difficult to obtain is not worth it. 
Two additional attributes can be added with respect to the composite indices proposed in a study, 
namely as wide coverage of states as possible and the usefulness of the adopted variable given 
that the purpose of some studies is to enable policy makers to identify priorities for building 
resilience. The choice of variables used in this thesis is based on these criteria 
13 
 
 
1.1.4. Computation of economic resilience index: Aggregation and weighting issues 
Composite economic resilience index can be weighted or non-weighted averages of standardized 
variables. This index use aggregation processes that follow different fundamental principles and 
computation techniques, it all depends on what the author wants to demonstrate and how he 
intends to do it. Two main methods are used to integrate the variables and sub-indexes into a 
single value (economic resilience index). 
First, regression models are estimated to calculate weights among variables. This method is 
followed by Atkins et al. (2000) to capture the sources of economic resilience. The regression 
explains the dependent variable gross domestic product using explanatory variables that refer to 
different sources of economic resilience. Adrianto & Matsuda (2004) also refer to a model to 
explain economic exposure as part of their composite resilience index. The two disadvantages of 
using a regression model can be summed up by the fact that this model is more complex for this 
kind of estimates and the integration of potential estimate errors from data that can be directly 
ready for use without additional estimates. 
Second, an average of the various variables can be used directly. Adrianto & Matsuda (2004) 
compute weighted averages that associate the economic exposure sub-index with two other sub-
indexes (economic vulnerability and economic resilience). Briguglio and Galea (2004) follow the 
same computation principle. Nevertheless, Briguglio (1995) recognizes the subjectivity or 
arbitrary characteristics of an ad hoc weighting: “alternative weighting schemes would not solve 
the problem of subjective choice”. The author acknowledges that there is no evidence of the 
higher validity of weighted variables compared with non-weighted variables. Non-weighted 
variables would not change the message conveyed through a composite resilience index in 
comparison with weighted variables.  
Moreover, it would be difficult to determine whether fluctuations in the value of a composite 
index are due to an effective evolution of the resilience state or to changes in the weighting 
system, because there is no absolute proof that such an econometric procedure can provide time-
invariant weights. For the same reasons, assigning weights to indicators based on expert 
elicitation does not solve problem, either. Consequently, most of the composite resilience indexes 
use a non-weighted average to integrate their components (Angeon & Bates 2015).  
14 
 
 
Kaly et al. (2004) argue that “simple averages across indicators can be used because they can be 
easily understood, and more complex models do not appear to offer any advantages to expression 
or utility of the index”. For this reason, composite resilience index commonly calculate the 
simple averages of variables, provided that they are standardized. Standardization/normalization 
is required to permit international comparisons because composite indexes per se aggregate 
variables with different measurement scales. To manage outliers, even if procedure is not typical, 
the composite indexes use the extrema values of variables in standardization technique. 
Nevertheless, as noted by Nardo et al. (2005), more complex methodologies could be used to 
synthesize data, such as multivariate models and factor analysis. 
Section 2. EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK 
In this section we try to build an empirical basis by summarizing the works of different 
researchers. These summaries are done based on four themes (economic resilience studies, 
resilience between regions according to a certain degree of shocks, some methodological basis, 
and Net Vulnerability-Resilience Index) that constitute the different points used in this section. 
1.2.1. Economic resilience studies  
In the paper presented by Cai, Lam, Qiang, Zou, Correll & Mihunov (2018) on A synthesis of 
disaster resilience measurement methods and indices, the authors synthesis study aimed to derive 
commonalities and new knowledge from the fragmented body of literature on resilience 
measurement. Through analyzing 174 articles collected for the period 2005–2017 and based on 
the simple description of the samples, the authors found that, 39.7% of the articles used 
qualitative methods and a similar percentage of articles (39.1%) used quantitative methods. Also, 
the most frequently used indicators in resilience measurement are income, employment, 
education, age, and previous disaster experience. 
For us, we assume that a qualitative study only, although it has certain advantages, may depart 
from certain realities. The best way for us to perfect this study is to adopt the quantitative aspect 
while keeping an eye on the qualitative analysis. Also, the choice of variables will be made with 
the idea that all variables can be selected whatever the field in which they concern, only they 
must relate to the economic resilience in low-income countries and they respect the selection 
criteria proposed in the literature. 
15 
 
 
1.2.2. Resilience between different regions according to a certain degree of shock 
Hill, Clair, Wial, Wolman, Atkins, Blumenthal, Ficenec & Friedhoff (2012) have conducted a 
study on the Economic Shocks and Regional Economic Resilience. Using a data base consisting 
of annual metropolitan level employment data for 361 MSAs in USA from 1970-2006, the 
authors identified nearly 1500 shocks to regional economies. In nearly half of these cases (47%), 
the affected region was “shock-resistant” and it did not suffer a serious economic downturn as a 
result of the shock. Regions suffering a downturn as a result of a shock were “resilient” 65% of 
the time. Regions that were adversely affected by a shock were less likely to be resilient if the 
shock was a national economic downturn alone (to which 55% of adversely affected regions were 
resilient) than if it were a national industry shock alone (80% resilient) or a local industry shock 
alone (77% resilient). The average length of time to resilience for a region after having suffered a 
shock-induced downturn was 2.9 years. 
However, even if the most resilient regions can be vulnerable to different shocks, it is the 
resilience that will ensure that a shock can last up for a long time or disappear just after its 
appearance. For example, in the event of a shock to the global production of goods, several 
countries may suffer the same degree of shock (vulnerable to the same degree) but the response 
capacity to deal with these shocks differs from one country to another and it depends on the 
economic and social structure of each country. Hence the need to conduct the study that can 
compare resilience capabilities between states. We do this in our study by elucidating the key 
variables that may be the basis of this resilience capacity but for low-income countries only. 
In the table 2 below presented, we reviewed briefly eighteen papers and articles, extracting from 
the main characteristics, tools used, and interpretation of economic resilience, with the aim of 
providing a complete overview to suggest new research questions and directions for the others 
research questions

 The analytical context changes according to the different economic objectives which range from regional accountability, job market analysis, business analysis 
and living standards and quality of life.

 Resilience might be analyzed to measure the economic success of a region/area in terms of: i) adjustment, ii) adaptation, iii) convergence, or iv) equilibrium; or 
according to Martin’s (2012) categories: i) renewal, ii) reorientation, iii) recovery, or iv) resistance. 
6
 The aspects account respectively for: a) the degree of regeneration along a regional growth path, b) the degree of adaptation in response to shock of the object 
under study; c) capacity in terms of speed and degree of recovery from shocks, and d) the extent of sensitivity to the shock. Framework refers to the treatment of 
time and space which has important impacts on the way the economic process that characterizes resilience is understood. The typical framework is static. Thus, 
time can be measured in moments of pre-shock, shock, and post-shock events, within the confines of the region/area. Alternatively, time can be seen as a constant 
process of transition in which space can be thought of as the result of a continuous flow of actions.

1.2.3. Some methodological basis for assessing simultaneously vulnerability and resilience 
Omar, Glen & Gian (2017) presented a paper entitled A new resilience rating system for 
Countries and States in which they opted for an analytical approach for calculating the economic 
resilience of nations and communities. They relied on the older risk evaluation method in to 
evaluate the resilience by making certain modifications like the substitution of the vulnerability 
by the intrinsic resilience of the country which is calculated with the method based on the data of 
Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). The applicability of their methodology was tested on 37 
countries (for most middle-income countries) by calculating the respective intrinsic resilience and 
resilience indexes of these 37 countries. For the authors, this approach provides new ways 
through which the hazard can be understood. 
The Commonwealth Vulnerability Index, developed by Atkins et al. (2000), considers the 
incidence and intensity of several risks. This method consists of a two-step approach that includes 
the construction of both a vulnerability impact index and a resilience index. Their aggregated 
index is reminiscent of that of Briguglio & Galea (2004). In this Index, the impact of 
vulnerability is assessed using a weighted least squares regression that joins income, various 
sources of volatility (such as economic exposure), sensitivity to environmental events and 
hazards, remoteness and insularity. The various sources of volatility refer to the stochastic term in 
the definition of economic volatility. In this index, GDP is a proxy for resilience, whereas its 
standard deviation is a proxy of vulnerability. 
In his paper titled towards more resilient economies: The role of well-functioning economic 
structures, Sondermann (2018) measures economic resilience by isolating common gross 
domestic product shocks across countries using VAR and panel models, then he abstract from the 
origin of the shock and just filter severe crises events by selecting the 10th percentile of the gross 
domestic product distribution of a sample of OECD countries over 35 years. In addition the 
author estimates whether the reaction to shocks and the likelihood of entering into a severe 
recession depends on the quality of national economic structures. Furthermore, he takes the 
evidence gathered on structural variables and links them to observable macro variables. He found 
robust evidence that strong and flexible institutions increase the resilience towards adverse 
shocks. He concluded that the financial and sovereign debt crisis has exposed the limited 
19 
 
 
(rigidities in labor markets, limited competition in product markets, framework conditions) 
economic resilience of several OECD and specifically most euro area economies. 
Blancard & Hoareau (2016) in their paper entitled are small island developing states more 
economically vulnerable than others? An empirical approach using composite indicator and data 
envelopment analysis. The main concern is on the determination of weights used to aggregate the 
seven sub-indicators compounding the economic vulnerability. They need to substitute the ad hoc 
weighting system adopted in the UNCDP by a less arbitrary endogenous one. Thus, they follow 
the model of Hatefi and Torabi (2010) generating a set of common weights shared by all 
countries. They found that the small island countries’ economies still remains fragile compared to 
the other developing countries groupings but the magnitude of the economic vulnerability has 
decreased. Their simulation stated especially that insular economies are now more vulnerable 
than low-income countries. They explain these facts by a structural effect concerning the design 
of the common weights system. 
The methodological lines adopted do not necessarily have to be the same for all studies; it 
depends on what the author seeks to explain and the field of study in which his work relates, the 
budget at his disposal to conduct the study, and so on. As far as we are concerned, we set up our 
own methodology approach that we consider appropriate for assessing and measuring the 
economic resilience of low-income countries. 
1.2.4. Net Vulnerability-Resilience Index 
Over the past decade a new approach to measuring economic resilience (NVRI) incorporating the 
sustainable development aspect into the choice of 43 variables grouped in 5 dimensions 
(Economic, social, environmental, political and peripheral) has emerged. Angeon & Bates (2015) 
analyze the NVRI related to mathematical algorithm (The B2A Algorithm) on graph theory. They 
found that NVRI follows a slightly ascending trend over the last decade, which allowing authors 
to conclude that there has been little worldwide improvement in the state of VR. They also found 
that the confidence intervals had a narrow spread, which revealed stability in the state of VR 
through time and space. Differences among the four groups of countries concerned the speed of 
NVRI evolution. In particular, the Least Developed Countries register the slowest average annual 
growth rate of the NVRI (0.47%), which is two times less than the other groups (0.73% for the 
Most Developed Countries, 0.84% for the Average Developed Countries and 0.73% for the Small 
20 
 
 
Island Developing States). In a sample of 95 states selected by Angeon & Bates, DR Congo and 
Nepal had not been taken into account. 
In the economic literature, Singapore is considered as a “good pupil” because of its resilience, 
though it is a small island which could be discriminated a priori because of intrinsic factors of 
vulnerability. Bates et al. (2014) want to check if Vulnerability-Resilience index conceived from 
a sustainable perspective confirms the greater resilience of Singapore that forges the Singapore 
paradox. Their analysis using the graph theory focuses on data that span from the last decade
