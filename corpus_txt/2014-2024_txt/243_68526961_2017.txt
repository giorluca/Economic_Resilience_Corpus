4 Abstract 
  
Various enhanced oil recovery methods including miscible gas injection, chemical, 
thermal and other methods are applied at the third phase of production after the 
primary and secondary recovery have been exhausted. Surfactant flooding is one of 
the chemical methods that is capable of recovering more oil by decreasing the IFT 
and/or wettability alteration. 
This piece of work aims to asses and select the development options using surfactant 
process that maximize oil recovery for a synthetic reservoir model by optimizing 
technical and economic analysis. 
Reservoir simulation study using ECLIPSE 100 was used to study the different 
development options of surfactant flooding applied and compare them to 
waterflooding. The development options include continuous surfactant injection, 
secondary surfactant flooding, and tertiary surfactant flooding. Through the study, 
the effect of injection rate, surfactant concentration and slug size were investigated 
by setting up a range of sensitivities.  
Results of the study reveal a general trend of increased oil recovery with the 
implementation of surfactant flooding over waterflooding in the range of 0.3 - 7%. In 
the continuous surfactant injection, the highest field oil efficiency of about 52% was 
achieved using surfactant concentration of 30 lb/stb at 2000 stb/d. The optimum 
development process from  the technical and economic point of view is injecting 
0.25 PV of surfactant as a tertiary recovery process using 25 lb/stb of surfactant and 
2000 stb/d as an injection  rate. The selected system yields an oil recovery of 
48.91%. 
vii 
 
 
 
 
The outcomes of this project is expected to assist the oil industry in planning 
surfactant flooding for heterogeneous reservoirs; which is the case of most  
reservoirs in UAE. 
 
Keywords: Enhanced oil recovery, surfactant flooding, continuous surfactant 
injection, field oil efficiency, tertiary recovery.

1 Chapter 1: Introduction 
 
1.1 Overview 
Oil recovery processes have been conventionally subdivided into three stages: 
primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary production, which is the initial production 
stage, results from the displacement of oil by the natural energy that exists in the 
reservoir. Secondary recovery is usually implemented after primary production 
declines. Waterflooding and gas injection are among the traditional secondary 
recovery processes (Green et al., 1998). Tertiary recovery is any technique applied 
after secondary recovery (Lake et al., 1986). Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) 
encompasses all methods that use external energy resources and/or materials to 
recover oil that cannot be produced economically by conventional techniques. EOR 
includes the following: 
 Chemical methods: polymer, surfactant, micellar polymer and caustic alkaline. 
 Miscible methods: hydrocarbon gas, carbon dioxide and nitrogen. 
 Thermal methods: steam flooding, steam stimulation and in-situ combustion 
(Satter et al., 2008). 
Most enhanced oil recovery methods can be categorized as secondary or tertiary 
depending at which stage of the reservoir producing life they are applied (Robertson 
et al., 1989).The optimum application of each method depends on the reservoir 
characteristics including oil type (Donaldson et al., 1985). In the last decade, 
improved oil recovery (IOR) has been used interchangeably with EOR. Although, 
there is no formal definition, IOR refers to any process that improves oil recovery 
2 
 
 
 
 
(Stosur et al. , 2003). Therefore, IOR includes other practices such as waterflooding, 
pressure maintenance, infill drilling and horizontal wells (Lake et al., 1986). 
1.2 Statement of the Problem 
Primary depletion and secondary recovery processes typically recover about one 
third of the original oil-in-place. Thus, about two trillion barrels of conventional oil 
and five trillion barrels of heavy oil remain in reservoirs after these methods have 
been exhausted. The low oil recoveries from conventional methods are the result of 
poor macroscopic sweep efficiencies that are attributed to the lack of mobility 
control and inefficient microscopic displacement caused by capillary trapping of oil 
mainly due to wettability and interfacial forces (Romsted, 2014). Thus, in recent 
years, the field of enhanced oil recovery has become more popular due to a 
combination of the world’s rising energy consumption, stagnant oil production, and 
low recoveries by conventional methods. EOR processes offer prospects for 
ultimately producing 30-60% or more of the reservoir IOIP (ARI, 2006). Surfactant 
flooding has the potential to improve recovery by reducing IFT and/or wettability 
alteration (Green et al.,1998). 
1.3 Relevant Literature 
1.3.1 Introduction to Surfactants 
Surfactants, also called surface-active agents, are chemical substances that are 
adsorbed onto surfaces or interfaces of a system when present at low concentrations 
(Green et al., 1998). They have a distinctive molecular configuration containing a 
structural group that has very little affinity for the solvent, called a lipophobic group, 
3 
 
 
 
 
together with a group that has strong affinity for the solvent, known as the lipophilic 
group (Rosen et al,, 2004). The lipophilic portion usually contains a long 
hydrocarbon chain which may be linear or branched. This lipophilic-lipophobic 
structure is named as amphipathic structure (Donaldson et al., 1989). The lipophilic 
group is usually called the “tail” and the lipophobic the “head” of the molecule 
(Green et al.,1998). The surface properties of such a compound are governed by the 
balance between its lipophilic and lipophobic features. A surfactant is called water 
soluble when it contains a hydrocarbon chain which could be linear or branched with 
less than 12 carbon atoms since the polar head groups drag the whole molecule in 
water. Conversely, when the chain length is greater than 14 carbon atoms, the 
compounds are named water-insoluble surfactants since they do not dissolve in water 
because of the long hydrocarbon chains (Donaldson et al., 1989). 
 
        Figure ‎1-1: Surface-active molecular structure (Green et al., 1998) 
 
1.3.2 Classification of Surfactants  
Most commonly, surfactants are classified based on the ionic nature of the head 
group as anionic, cationic, nonionic, zwitterionic. The head group in anionic 
surfactant bears a negative charge in aqueous solutions as in sodium dodecyl sulfate 
4 
 
 
 
 
(C12H25SO4
-
Na
+
), whereas the head group in cationic surfactant bears a positive 
charge in aqueous solutions as in dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide 
(C12H25N
+

1.3.3 Applications of Surfactants 
Surfactants represent one of the major and most versatile products used in the 
chemical industry (Rosen et al., 2004).  There are many applications for the products 
that are used daily (e.g. soaps, detergents, shampoos, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, 
foods, and etc.) and in industry (e.g. oilfield chemicals, textile finishing and 
processing ,emulsions, paint and coatings, pulp and paper, etc.) (Myers,2006).  
1.3.4 Surfactants in the Petroleum Industry 
Surfactants are used throughout the petroleum industry. They are important in 
drilling, cement slurries, acidization, fracturing ,corrosion inhibition, demulsification, 
cleaning, transportation, waterflooding, steam, foam and chemical flooding and 
environment protection (Bhardwaj et al., 1993).   
1.3.4.1 Use of Surfactants in Oil Recovery 
The use of surfactants for improving the oil recovery started in late 1920’s and early 
1930’s (Donaldson et al., 1985).Anionics and nonionics surfactants have been used 
in EOR processes. Anionic surfactants have been the most widely used in oil 
recovery processes since they are relatively stable, have good surfactant properties, 
5 
 
 
 
 
exhibit relatively low adsorption on reservoir rock, and can be produced in an 
economical manner. Among the numerous anionic surfactants, sulfonates have been 
commonly used in EOR processes during the past 50 years. These include: petroleum 
sulfonates, synthetic sulfonates and ethoxylates sulfonates (Donaldson et al., 1989).  
Nonionic surfactants have been used mainly as surfactants to enhance the behavior of 
surfactant systems. They are much more tolerant of high salinity brine compared to 
anionics but their surface active properties are not as good as anionics. Cationics are 
not usually used because they strongly adsorb on reservoir rocks  (Green et al., 
1998).  
1.3.4.2 Surfactant Flooding  
Surfactant flooding is an EOR process in which surfactant solution is injected to 
sweep the reservoir.  The presence of surfactant lowers the interfacial tension 
between the oil and water phases and also changes the reservoir rock wettability to 
improve oil recovery. It has appeared in the literature under many names such as 
low-tension flooding detergent flooding and chemical flooding (Romsted, 2014) 
.Surfactant flooding creates microemulsion solutions, which may consist of different 
combinations of surfactants, co-surfactants, hydrocarbons, water and electrolytes 
(Green et al., 1998). A typical surfactant flood is shown below: 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure ‎1-2: Surfactant flooding process (Emgwalu, 2009) 
Generally, there are three types of surfactant flooding for EOR (Rosen et al., 2005) 
as shown in the following table : 
Table ‎1-1: Types of surfactant flooding 
Type of surfactant flooding Technique Note 
Microemulsion flooding Microemulsions are formed 
by injecting surfactants, co-
surfactant, alcohol, and 
brine to obtain ultralow 
IFT. 
It can be designed to perform 
well in high temperature or 
salinity or low permeable 
areas where polymer and/or 
alkali cannot succeed. 
Micelle/polymer flooding A micelle slug usually 
containing  surfactant, co-
surfactant, alcohol, brine 
and oil is injected into the 
reservoir. 
Displacement efficiency 
close to 100% (laboratory 
measurement  ). 
Alkaline/surfactant/polymer 
flooding 
The addition of alkaline 
chemicals lowers the IFT at  
considerably low surfactant 
concentrations.  
Lower concentration of 
surfactants is involved in this 
process in order to  reduce 
the cost of chemicals. 
 
Surfactant flooding can be conducted as a tertiary displacement near the end of 
waterflood or as a secondary flood (Green and Willhite,1998). 
The favorable characteristics for Surfactant Flooding include : 
7 
 
 
 
 
 High permeability and porosity. 
 High remaining oil saturation (>25%).  
 Light oil less than 50 cp--but recent trend is to apply to viscous oils up to 200 cp 
or even higher viscosity. 
 Short project life due to favorable combination of small well spacing and/or high 
injectivity. 
 Onshore. 
 Good geological continuity.  
 Good source of high quality water. 
 Reservoir temperatures less than 300 ºF. 
 
1.3.4.2.1 Main Aspects of Surfactant Flooding 
I. Reservoir temperature 
II. Timing 
III. Capillary forces and capillary number 
At the end of waterflooding, the remaining oil is believed to be present as immobile 
globules distributed through the rock pores in petroleum reservoirs. The two main 
forces acting on these immobile globules are capillary forces and viscous forces. The 
capillary number is defined as the ratio of viscous forces to capillary forces and is 
represented as: 
         (1.1) 
where ν and μ are velocity and viscosity of the displacing fluid, respectively, σ is the 
oil-water interfacial tension and θ is the contact angle between the oil-water interface 
 cos/caN
8 
 
 
 
 
and the rock surface measured through the denser phase, which is water in this case 
(Donnez , 2012). 
At the end of waterflooding, the capillary number ranges from 10
-6
 to 10
-7
. The oil 
displacement efficiency increases as the capillary number increases. The  capillary 
number can be increased by increasing the aqueous phase viscosity (μw) and flow 
rate or by decreasing the interfacial tension between oil and water, which generally 
ranges from 20 to 30 dyne/cm. By injecting an appropriate surfactant, the interfacial 
tension can be lowered to 10
-3
 or 10
-4 
dyne/cm (Donaldson et al., 1989). 
IV.  Interfacial tension I 
It is well accepted that oil recovery efficiency can be improved by obtaining ultra-
low interfacial tension between oil and water by adsorption at the interface. The flow 
of trapped oil droplets or ganglia through the narrow necks of pores is illustrated 
schematically in Figure 1-3 (Donaldson et al., 1989). 
 
Figure ‎1-3: The effect of IFT on the movement of oil ganglia through the narrow 
necks of pores (Donaldson et al., 1989) 
 
An ultra-low interfacial tension (often less than 10
-3
 dyne/cm) between oil and water 
phases is required for easy the flow of trapped oil drops since it reduces the 
deformation work needed for oil ganglia to move through the narrow necks of pore 
9 
 
 
 
 
channels (Donaldson et al., 1989). Foster (1973) and Hill, Reisberg and Stegemeier 
(1973) observed that relatively small concentrations of petroleum sulfonates can 
produce such low interfacial tension between oil and water. Researchers found that 
the IFT of an oil–water–surfactant system is a function of salinity, oil composition, 
surfactant type and concentration, cosurfactant, electrolytes, temperature, and the 
phase behavior of the system (Adkins et al., 2012). 
 Influence of salinity on IFT  
Winsor (1954) recognized three types of phase equilibria in microemulsion phase as 
type I, type II, and type III. Healy and Reed (1974) explained how the Winsor-type 
behavior describes the change in phase behavior, solubilization of oil and water and 
IFT as a function of salinity for anionic surfactants. The oil–water–surfactant system 
is strongly affected by the water salinity. This phase behavior is represented by a 
ternary diagram as shown in the Figure 1-4: 
 
Figure ‎1-4: Three types of microemulsions and the effect of salinity on phase 
behavior (Healy and Reed, 1974) 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
The surfactant flood exhibit good aqueous phase solubility and poor oleic phase 
solubility in case of  low brine salinities, thus forming type I phase behavior. In type 
I system, an oil-in-water microemulsion is formed, and the surfactant remains in the 
aqueous phase (Schramm et al., 2000). This system is referred to as the lower phase 
microemulsion or type II (-) system, where II means no more than two phases can 
form and (-) means that the tie-lines have negative slope. This phase behavior is not 
favorable to achieve ultralow IFT. A water-in-oil microemulsion with an excess oil 
phase is defined as the upper phase microemulsion or type II (+). This behavior leads 
to the retention of surfactants in the oil phase and is not favored in EOR. In a type III 
microemulsion, the surfactant forms a microemulsion in a separate phase between 
the oil and aqueous phases. This phase forms a continuous layer containing 
surfactant, water and dissolved hydrocarbons. Usually, type III provides low IFT 
especially when equal volumes of water and oil are solubilized in the microemulsion. 
This condition is defined as optimal salinity, which exhibits the lowest IFT between 
the water and the oil. In addition, optimal salinity can be expressed as the midpoint 
salinity where  IFT between microemulsion and water and that between 
microemulsion and oil are more or less the same. Type III system is desirable for 
EOR processes (Aoudia et al., 1995). 
A. Influence of surfactant structure on IFT 
Bourrel and Schechter (1988) has established a clear relationship between surfactant 
structure and fluid properties associated with EOR performance. The surfactant 
structure determines its solubility in either water or oil. Increasing the effect of the 
nonpolar end of the surfactant increases oil solubility (Adkins et al., 2012). The best 
surfactants used in EOR applications normally have a branched tail.  
11 
 
 
 
 
B. Influence of oil properties on IFT 
High specific gravity crude oils are normally rich in organic acids; thus, the 
surfactant-oil solubility is lower in such oils. Some correlations have been found for 
the tendency  of a surfactant to dissolve in oil as the temperature increases. For many 
anionics, higher temperatures correspond to better solubility in brine. This behavior 
is reversed for nonionics. In conclusion, cosurfactants can be used to enhance 
solubility so that the transition from type II (-) system to type II (+) system can occur 
at different salinities (Romsted, 2014). 
C. Influence of surfactant concentration on IFT  
It is necessary to find an optimal concentration because surfactants get adsorbed by 
the rock. When a large amount of surfactant gets adsorbed, the concentration in the 
solution decreases and the surfactant capacity to lower interfacial tension is reduced  
(Donaldson et al. ,1989). Cayias et al. (1977) reported that IFT decreases as the 
surfactant concentration increases, and at critical concentration the IFT approaches 
its minimum value. Beyond this critical concentration, the IFT increases with 
increase  of surfactant concentration. Sharma et al. (1983) indicated that adding a 
nonionic surfactant containing phosphate ester can widen the IFT minimum. 
V. Phase behavior 
Microemulsion systems can be designed that have ultralow IFT values with either 
aqueous or hydrocarbon phase. Ultralow IFT are associated with high solubilization 
of oil and water by the microemulsion system. Thus, regions of low IFT are found by 
examining the phase behavior of microemulsion systems to locate regions of high 
solubilization. The phase behavior of microemulsions is complex and there are no 
universal equations of state for even simple microemulsions. A microemulsion 
usually consists of at least three components: surfactant, hydrocarbon, and water. 
12 
 
 
 
 
Cosurfactant and electrolyte could be added though are not necessary. The number of 
components must be reduced due to time and economic constraints by combining 
one or more components into pseudocomponents. In most cases, the surfactant and 
cosurfactant are treated as pseudocomponent named as “surfactant”. Water and 
electrolyte are represented by the brine pseudocomponent (Green and Willhite, 
1998). On a ternary diagram such as the one shown in Figure 1-5, by convention, the 
top apex of the diagram represents the surfactant pseudocomponent, the lower left 
apex represents brine and the lower right apex represents oil (Reed et al., 1977). 
Concentrations may be expressed as mass or volume fractions (Green et al., 1998).  
 
Figure ‎1-5: Pseudo-ternary representation of oil-water-surfactant system (Reed and 
Healy,1977) 
 
VI. Wettability 
Many researchers including Melrose (1965); McCaffery and Mungan (1970) and 
Salathiel (1973) suggested that rock wettability can be altered by adding a simple 
salt, acid or base to flood water. 
13 
 
 
 
 
.  
Figure ‎1-6: The role of wettability and contact angle on oil displacement (Donaldson 
et al., 1989) 
 
As can be seen in Figure 1-7, the oil-wettable surface leads to poor oil displacement, 
while the water wettable surface leads to more efficient oil displacement. Choosing 
an appropriate surfactant can selectively change the rock wettability from oil to water 
that can facilitate favorable conditions for efficient oil displacement (Donaldson et 
al., 1989).  
1.3.4.2.2 Mechanism of Surfactant Loss in Porous Media   
Precipitation, phase trapping and adsorption are various mechanisms by which 
surfactants get trapped by the reservoir rock. A lot of research in the past and recent 
times have  produced ways to technically avoid loss of surfactant through 
precipitation and phase trapping. This may be achieved by using salt tolerant 
surfactants (Chinenye, 2010). As the surfactant slug contacts reservoir rock and 
water, there would be a loss of surfactants due to adsorption at solid-liquid interface. 
Therefore, only part of the total surfactant injected in the reservoir is available for the 
displacement process (Donaldson et al., 1989). Many investigators including Ginn 
(1970); Somasundaran and Grieves (1975) and Bae and Petrick (1976) have 
examined the adsorption of various petroleum sulfonates on solid-liquid interfaces. It 
14 
 
 
 
 
was noted that the maximum adsorption occurs near the critical micelle concentration 
which is defined as the concentration of surfactants above which micelles form and 
all additional surfactants added to the system go to micelles. Novosad (1981) studied 
surfactant adsorption in the presence of short-chain alcohols. He found that 
surfactant loss can be minimized by the addition of low molecular weight alcohols 
such as secondary butyl alcohol and n-propanol. 
1.3.4.2.3 Application of Surfactant-Based Process in Sandstone Reservoirs 
Most applications of surfactant-based EOR processes have been in sandstone 
reservoirs. Favorable reservoir characteristics in sandstones include high porosity, 
high permeability and good geologic continuity. Low clay content is important to 
have low surfactant retention (Aoudia et al., 1995). Many of the current chemicals 
are more effective at temperatures less than 150ºC. In addition, it is more preferable 
to have the remaining oil in place more than 25% with a viscosity less than 50 cp 
(Sheng, 2011). A majority of implemented projects have been in onshore reservoirs 
because of the salinity effect on surfactants and the need for a reliable source of high 
quality water (Romsted, 2014). One of the reasons that surfactant EOR is not as 
common in carbonate reservoirs is that anionic surfactants are highly adsorbed on the 
rock surface because of the positive charge. Furthermore, anhydrite is often present 
in carbonates which causes precipitation (Morrow, 1990; Al-Hasihm et al., 1996; 
Bortalotti et al., 2009; Manrique et al., 2007). Since most of the world’s oil reserves 
are contained in carbonate reservoirs, the application of surfactant-based methods in 
carbonate reservoirs has lately become an active area of research as a strategy to 
increase oil recovery (Treibel et al., 1972; Manrique et al., 2014;  Romsted, 2014).

2 Chapter 2: Reservoir Simulation Model Description 
 
Surfactant flooding through the reservoir can be modeled using the ECLIPSE 100 
simulator. The ECLIPSE 100 is a fully–implicit, three-phase, three dimensional 
general purpose black oil simulator. The surfactant model in ECLIPSE 100 does not 
provide the detailed chemistry of the process, but rather models the important 
features of a surfactant flood on a full field basis. The simulation started on 1
st
 of 
January 2009, and continued for 41 years up to 2050. The simulation run stops once 
the water cut reaches 90%. 
2.1 Gridding and Rock Data  
The synthetic reservoir model shown in Figure 2-1 has dimensions 2250' × 1575' × 
150'. Each layer has 30 x 21 cells. There grid cells consist of 15 layers, distributed 
among three geological layers: 
 Geological layer 1 represents grid layers 1 to 5 
 Geological layer 2 represents to grid layers 6 to 10 
 Geological layer 3 represents to grid layers 11 to 15.

Figure ‎2-1: Reservoir synthetic model 
 
As illustrated, one injector is located in block number (8, 11) and one producer in 
block number (22, 11) where both have been completed in the three layers. The 
depth of  the reservoir top is 400o ft. The initial reservoir pressure was 4000 psi at 
datum depth of 4000 ft and the production bottom hole pressure was 3500 psi. The 
oil-water contact is below the reservoir (6000 ft), with zero capillary pressure at the 
contact.

3.1 Reservoir Development Plan 
Figure 3-1 presents a reservoir development plan that consists of two key 
components, pilot-field tests and development option identification. The dependent 
variables of the technical ultimate recovery are described through the development 
option, where it mainly encompasses the following: 
 Development process, 
 Development scheme, 
 Reservoir management, 
 Business plan. 
This plan forms a basis for this piece of work, where different development 
processes will be examined. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure ‎3-1: Full field development plan optimization (Abed, 2008) 
3.2 Reservoir Development Option Identification 
The assessment and selection of the development option that will maximize the oil 
recovery needs to be defined through viable development options and processes. 
In defining the constraints, all dependent variables that will affect the results of the 
study will be considered (Abed, 2008). 
In addition, two development processes were identified: 
 Waterflooding 
 Surfactant flooding 
23 
 
 
 
 
For the surfactant flooding process, the following development injection plans will 
be analyzed: 
 Continuous surfactant injection 
 Secondary surfactant flooding 
 Tertiary surfactant flooding 
Through the study the effect of injection rate, surfactant concentration and surfactant 
slug size were investigated.  
 Surfactant slug size 
o Secondary flooding: 0.1,0.3,0.5 and 0.7 PV. 
o Tertiary flooding: 0.1,0.2,0.25 and 0.3 PV. 
 Surfactant concentration (1,25,30 and 35 lb/stb). 
 Injection rate (1000,2000 and 3000 stb/d). 
The injection rate is set for the surfactant and water injection and are equal in all 
cases. Tables 4-1 to 4-4 present the development processes identified through the 
study. A total of 111 simulation runs were prepared and run using the ECLIPSE 100 
simulator, where all the scenarios indicated in the followed tables were considered.

4 Chapter 4: Development Processes Assess Study 
 
Two processes were defined, waterflooding and surfactant flooding. For the 
surfactant flooding process, three development processes were investigated. 
The main development processes are continuous surfactant injection, secondary 
surfactant injection, and tertiary surfactant injection.  
Different sensitivities were handled for both processes as defined in chapter 3. In 
case of waterflooding, the effect of injection rate was examined. However, for the 
surfactant flood process, the sensitivities were carried on the effect of different 
injection rate, surfactant concentration and surfactant slug size. 
4.1 Sensitivity Analysis 
4.1.1 Waterflooding process 
As stated previously, the prediction runs were simulated by studying the effect of: 
Injection rate (1000, 2000, 3000 stb/d). 
The 2000 stb/d is the base case injection  rate. The results of the three simulation 
runs are shown in Tables 4-1 to 4-3 and Figures 4-1 to 4-3. 
The main results of each run throughout the study are summarized by the following 
terms as follows: 
 FOE: Field Oil Efficiency (%) 
 FOPT: Field Oil Production Total (stb) 
 FPR: Field Pressure (psia) 
 FWCT: Field Water Cut (dimensionless) 
 FWIT: Field Water Injection Total (stb)

 FWPT: Field Water Production Total (stb) 
 FTITSUR: Field Surfactant Injection Total (lb) 
 FTPTSUR: Field Surfactant Production Total (lb)

According to the illustrated results, the following conclusions can be drawn: 
 The injection rate was set constant throughout all runs. 
 The water cut economic limit which is 90% was not reached after the 41 years 
which is the entire simulation period when water was injected at 1000 stb/d. On 
the other hand, the water cut economic limit was reached after 32 years with the 
2000 stb/d injection rate and after 20 years with the 3000 stb/d.  
 Increasing the water injection rate leads to reaching the water cut economic limit 
in a shorter time.

 Early water breakthrough was observed in the three cases. 
 Following the pressure drawdown period which lasted for almost a year in all 
cases, the pressure started to build up since the effect of water injection has been 
felt. 
Table 4-4 shows the oil recovery obtained for the different injection rates. Figure 4-4 
shows the oil recovery efficiency profile for the different cases and Figure 4-5 is a 
bar graph representing FOE at each injection rate attempted.

As shown above, the maximum oil recovery was achieved at an injection rate of 
2000 stb/d. Increasing the injection rate from 1000 to 2000 stb/d increased the 
recovery by 10%.  Injecting water at 3000 stb/d resulted in about 4% decrease in the 
recovery since the water cut limit was reached relatively earlier which lead to 
shutting in the oil producer. 
4.1.2 Surfactant Flooding Processes 
The forecast runs attempted were simulated by studying the effect of different 
parameters on the performance of the flood as follows, where three different 
development processes were studied: 
 Continuous surfactant injection 
o Surfactant concentration (1,25,30 and 35 lb/stb) 
o Injection rate (1000, 2000, and 3000 stb/d) 
 Secondary surfactant flooding

development options investigated throughout the study along with normal

It is important to note at this stage that ECLIPSE 100 assumes that the surfactant 
exists only in the water phase, and the input to the reservoir is specified as a 
concentration at the water injector. 
I. Continuous Surfactant Injection 
Twelve runs were simulated using ECLIPSE 100 and the effect of different 
surfactant concentrations and injection rates were studied. The results of three runs 
all at 30 lb/stb surfactant concentration and at different injection rates are presented 
in Tables 4-5 to 4-7 and Figures 4-7 to 4-9. Similar trends and results were obtained 
for other surfactant concentration including 1, 25 and 35 lb/stb. A comparison 
between all different scenarios will be presented in terms of oil recovery efficiency.

Based on the results presented at 30 lb/stb where the three different injection rates 
were attempted, the following findings can be drawn: 
 The earliest water breakthrough was experienced when the injection rate was 
3000 stb/d. 
 As the injection rate time increases, the water breakthrough takes place earlier. 
 The water cut limit was not reached after 41 years when water was injected at 
1000 stb/d, but it was reached after 26 years with the 2000 stb/d and 17 years 
with the 3000 stb/d. 
39 
 
 
 
 
 The highest build up plateau was associated with the 3000 stb/d injection rate 
since the largest volume of water and surfactants were injected in this case. 
 The highest total oil produced was achieved with the 2000 stb/d injection rate. 
Table 4-8 shows the oil recovery obtained for different surfactant concentrations 
corresponding to the three injection rates and Figure 4-10 represents the oil recovery 
efficiency profile for each scenario.

Based on the data presented above, implementing the continuous surfactant flooding

result in a significant enhancement in oil recovery over waterflooding. The 
percentage increase over waterflooding for the 1000, 2000 and 3000 stb/d are 0.51, 
0.53 and 0.79 %,  respectively.  Increasing the surfactant concentration, increased the 
oil recovery efficiency. It is clearly shown in Table 4-8 that increasing the injection 
rate at any constant surfactant concentration to 3000 stb/d decreases the oil recovery. 
This happens because the water cut economic limit is reached in a relatively shorter 
time compared to the other two cases. Conducting the flood at 35 lb/stb and 2000 
stb/d leads to the maximum oil recovery of all cases. The optimum combination can 
be only determined by calculating the net present value for each combination.

As seen in Table 4-9, increasing the surfactant concentration at a constant injection 
rate leads to increase in the oil recovery efficiency. It is clear that increasing the 
surfactant concentration to 25 lb/stb leads to a significant increase in the recovery 
efficiency but the increase became less significant when the concentration is 
increased to 30 lb/stb and almost negligible when the concentration is 35 lb/stb. The 
same trend was noticed with the other injection rates. Accordingly, conducting the 
continuous surfactant flooding at 30 lb/stb and 2000 stb/d is considered to the 
optimum case from the technical point of view.

I. Secondary Surfactant flooding 
A total of forty eight runs were simulated using ECLIPSE 100 and the effect of 
different surfactant slug size, surfactant concentrations and injection rates were 
studied. The results of four runs all at 30 lb/stb surfactant concentration and 2000 
stb/d at four different surfactant slug sizes are presented in Tables 4-10 to 4-13 and 
Figures 4-12 to 4-15. Similar results an
