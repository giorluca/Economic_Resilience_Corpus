Chemical recycling viapyrolysis offers a pathway toward closing the material loop by handling this heteroge-neouswaste andproviding feedstock for producing virgin plastics. This study compareschemical recycling and energy recovery scenarios for APW regarding climate changeimpact and cumulative energy demand (CED), assessing potential environmentaladvantages. In addition, an economic assessment is conducted. In contrast to otherstudies, the assessments are based on pyrolysis experiments conducted with an actualwaste fraction. Mass balances and product composition are reported. The experimen-tal data is combined with literature data for up- and downstream processes for theassessment. Chemical recycling shows a lower net climate change impact (0.57 to0.64 kg CO2e/kg waste input) and CED (3.38 to 4.41 MJ/kg waste input) than energyrecovery (climate change impact: 1.17 to 1.25 kg CO2e/kg waste input; CED: 6.94 to7.97MJ/kgwaste input),while energy recoveryperformsbetter economically (net pro-cessing cost of−0.05 to−0.02€/kg waste input) compared to chemical recycling (0.05to 0.08€/kg waste input). However, chemical recycling keeps carbon in the materialcycle contributing to a circular economy and reducing the dependence on fossil feed-stocks. Therefore, an increasing circularity of APW through chemical recycling showsa conflict between economic and environmental objectives.KEYWORDSautomotive plastics recycling, carbonmanagement, chemical recycling, circular economy, climatechange impact, industrial ecologyThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, providedthe original work is properly cited.© 2023 The Authors.

Therefore, more automotive plastic waste (APW) will have to be handled in the future. Defect plas-tic components are replaced during the use phase generating mixed APW. At the end-of-life (EoL), a highly heterogeneous automotive shredderresidue (ASR) contains mixed plastics of different origins. Currently, landfilling and energy recovery are the dominating waste-handling optionsfor APW and ASR in Europe (Cossu & Lai, 2015; Mehlhart et al., 2018), resulting in high environmental burdens and a loss of valuable resourceslikewise. Enhancing the circular economy with advanced recycling technologies is a strategy to keep carbon from waste available as feedstock forthe chemical industry and reduce its dependency on fossil carbon feedstock (Meys et al., 2021).Mechanical recyclers already face the challengeof complexwastemixtures andcompositematerials handling, for example, lightweight packagingwaste. However, APW additionally contains high shares of non-standard functionalized engineering thermoplastics, thermosets, and elastomersresulting in polymer cross-contamination and non-polymer impurities within recovered waste fractions (Cossu & Lai, 2015; Pivnenko et al., 2015)that poseanadditional challenge formechanical recyclingprocesses. Therefore,mechanical recyclingof automotiveplastics canalter the recyclates’mechanical properties (Bernasconi et al., 2007; Colucci et al., 2017; Pietroluongo et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2018). New waste-handling options areneeded to reduce environmental impacts, decrease the dependence on fossil feedstocks by increasing circularity while at the same time being costcompetitive in comparison to current waste-handling practices.Chemical recycling processes can close the material and carbon loop by handling heterogeneous waste streams unsuitable for mechanical recy-cling (Dogu et al., 2021) and providing feedstock for virgin plastics production (Meys et al., 2020; Solis & Silveira, 2020). Pyrolysis as a chemicalrecycling option is currently assessed for multiple waste streams (Davidson et al., 2021; Kusenberg et al., 2022a; Volk et al., 2021; Zeller et al.,2021), with promising results for waste streams primarily consisting of polyolefins.The literature on pyrolysis can be divided into technology research and technology assessments. Technology-focused research investigates thepyrolysis process in detail regarding feedstock material, reactor type, product composition, and process parameters. This includes studies on thepyrolysis of ASR (Cossu et al., 2014; Galvagno et al., 2001; Notarnicola et al., 2017). However, no studies on the pyrolysis of APW are known.Studies of the second category focus on economic feasibility and environmental impact. Due to the lack of data from established processes or alow technology readiness level (TRL), assessments are made either based on thermodynamic considerations (Meys et al., 2020), experiments withdifferent waste fractions (Cardamone et al., 2022), or laboratory-scale experiments of virgin instead of post-consumer material (Gracida-Alvarezet al., 2019a, 2019b). Jeswani et al. (2021) used experimental data from larger-scale experiments. However, the data is not publicly available dueto confidentiality and cannot be validated. While these studies can provide valuable input regarding the potential of different chemical recyclingprocesses, there is the potential formisleading resultswhen experimental data from technology research-oriented studies not specifically designedfor process assessment are used. This may be the case if data from a waste stream is used to approximate another waste fraction that behavesdifferently in pyrolysis.Therefore, this study follows an integrated approach by conducting pyrolysis experiments according to the subsequent process assessment’sneeds. A sample from an actual APW is taken, thoroughly characterized, and pyrolyzed in a pilot-scale continuous reactor with a throughput ofapproximately 1 kg/h. Mass balances and pyrolysis gas and oil product composition are reported for transparency. The chemical recycling processchain includes upstream mechanical pre-treatment of the APW, pyrolysis, and downstream upgrading of the liquid pyrolysis product to the spec-ifications of steam cracker feedstock (naphtha substitute) followed by high-value chemical (HVC) production through steam cracking. Literaturedata for up- and downstream processes are combined with experimental data from the pyrolysis of APW to create a life cycle inventory (LCI) andenable life cycle assessment (LCA) before the commercialization of pyrolysis technology at a large scale. The economic indicator of process costsand the environmental indicators of climate change impact and cumulative energy demand (CED) are compared with the current waste-handlingpractice of energy recovery. Consequently, this study contributes to understanding different waste treatment options for automotive plastics andtheir contribution to a sustainable circular economy.2 METHODOLOGYBesides the experimental analyses, this study combinesmaterial flow cost analysis (MFCA)with LCAmethods (Rieckhof &Guenther, 2018). Due tomissing data, for example, elemental flows, the LCA is streamlined by narrowing the considered environmental impacts to climate change impactand CED (Gradin & Björklund, 2021).2.1 ScopeThe assessed chemical recycling path is derived from the current energy recovery route for mixed APW collected in automotive workshops. Thesystem boundaries of both considered processes include metal recycling and energy recovery (Figure 1). Table S1-1 in supporting information (S1)summarizes them. The functional unit of the assessment is the treatment of 1 kg of APW collected from automotive workshops. 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

In RDF production, the APW is shredded, and steel, aluminum, and copper are separatedand sent to respective recycling processes. The RDF is incinerated in municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) and RDF power plants. Energy isrecovered through heat and electricity based on average efficiencies forMSWI and RDF power plants. 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

Scenario description Description1.1 Energy recovery (baseline) Incineration path of produced RDF: 30%MSWI plant, 70%RDF combustion plant1.2 Energy recovery (optimized) Incineration path of produced RDF: 100%RDF combustion plant2.1 Chemical recycling (baseline) Yield of pyrolysis products according to conducted experimentsa: 50% pyrolysis oil, 20%pyrolysis gas, 28% pyrolysis residue, 2% aqueous condensate.2.2 Chemical recycling (lower yield) Yield of pyrolysis products adapted: 44% pyrolysis oil, 20% pyrolysis gas, 34% pyrolysis residue,2% aqueous condensate.aaPyrolysis product distribution converted to a feedstock free of metals (experiments did not havemetal-free feedstock).2.1.2 Chemical recycling (pyrolysis) pathFollowing RDF production, RDF is fed into an integrated pyrolysis unit producing pyrolysis oil as the main product and pyrolysis gas, an aqueouscondensate, and a solid pyrolysis residue fraction as by-products. Gas andoil fractionsmainly consist of hydrocarbons; the pyrolysis residue fractionconsists ofmineral residues and carbonaceous char. Based on their calculated net calorific values, it is assumed that high-temperature process heatfor the pyrolysis can be provided by the incineration of pyrolysis by-products, that is, pyrolysis residues, pyrolysis gas, and aqueous condensate. Theplant design assumes excess low-temperature heat can be sold to customers, such as a district heating network. Ashes are landfilled. Furthermore,the pyrolysis oil is assumed to be upgraded in a hydroprocessing step, replacing naphtha as a steam-cracking feedstock. By steam cracking, HVCethene, propene, butadiene, and pyrolysis gasoline are produced, which are raw materials for synthesizing chemical products, including virginplastics.2.2 Impact assessmentAn economic and environmental assessment of both recovery paths (Figure 1) is performed where each process step is assessed individually, andall process steps along the recycling path are summed up. The APW is not associated with production or use phase burdens following the zero-burden approach (Nakatani, 2014). Products and marketable by-products are rewarded with the impact of primary material production followingthe avoided burden approach (Nakatani, 2014). Impacts are allocated based onmass. Intermediate products are associatedwith the burdens of theprevious treatment steps.The economic assessment includes fixed operational costs1 based on the plant investments and variable utility operating costs. The base year ofthe economic assessment is 2021. Products and marketable by-products result in revenues that are realized. Costs of CO2 emissions are internal-ized based on direct CO2 emissions of each process step and CO2 emission prices of the EU emission trading system. The avoided CO2 emissionsfrom the primary production of products and by-products are rewardedwith a negative emission price.The streamlined LCA assesses the climate change impact over 100 years as defined by the IPCC (2013). The CED, as defined by VDI (2012), isevaluated to assess the energy impacts of the recovery paths (Iacovidou et al., 2017).2.3 Scenario definitionScenarios analyze the influence of underlying data and assumptions on the assessment (Table 1). The energy recovery baseline scenario (scenario1.1) is the incineration of RDF inMSWI plants (30%) and RDF power plants (70%). The incineration shares reflect the current practice in Europeancountries (Jeswani et al., 2021; van Eygen et al., 2018). Scenario 1.2 assesses the RDF combustion inmore efficient RDF power plants only.The baseline scenario for chemical recycling (scenario 2.1) uses the conducted pyrolysis experiments’ data (Section 3). Pyrolysis oil is used to pro-duce HVC, while pyrolysis gas and solids are used for energy recovery. Scenario 2.2 considers a lower pyrolysis oil yield than scenario 2.1, assigning10% of pyrolysis oil yield to the pyrolysis residue.3 EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF PYROLYSISThepyrolysis technology assessment and LCI data for the pyrolysis are basedonpilot-scale experiments using collectedAPWmaterial. Thematerialwas thoroughly characterized. Mass balances and energy consumption for pyrolysis were determined from experiments, and pyrolysis oil productquality was assessed based on heteroatom content. The pyrolysis experiments included metals in the feedstock. Therefore, this section reportspyrolysis product distribution based on the full feedstock. For process assessment, the product distribution is converted to metal-free feedstockbased on ametal content of 9% in the feedstockmaterial as themetal content is recovered in RDF production in both paths.

The underlying data used to createthis figure can be found in Supporting Information S2.3.1 Characterization of automotive plastic waste sampleThe APW sample was obtained from waste collected at automotive workshops around Stuttgart, Germany. First, all parts were inventoried. Largemetal parts, such as bumper cross beams,were excluded from the sample. Smallermetal parts remained in the sample andwere not removed beforethe experiments. From the automobile manufacturer’s database, sample composition was estimated to be polyolefins (57%), polycarbonates andblends thereof (19%), polyamides (5%), other polymers (12%), and other non-polymer materials (e.g., metals, minerals, biomass) (7%). However,manual sorting of a shredded sample showed a significant deviation of themetal content (3.5% ferrous and 5.5%non-ferrousmetals), making devia-tions of other components’ shares likely. For elemental balances of the pyrolysis experiments, the pre-sortedmaterial’s elemental composition andash content were determined (Table S1-4, Supporting Information S1).3.2 Pyrolysis experimental set-upThe samplewas shredded to aparticle size of 10mm.Theexperimentswere conducted in anelectrically heated continuouspilot-scale screw reactorwith a throughput of plastic waste of approximately 1 kg/h and a solids residence time of 45 min at a temperature of 450◦C. A moderator medium(sand) improves heat and mass transfer properties at a 1:4 mass ratio (feedstock:moderator). The reactor has already been described elsewhere(Tomasi Morgano et al., 2018; Zeller et al., 2021). The supporting information describes analytical techniques used for material and product char-acterization (Section A2, Supporting Information S1). Five repetitive experiments with 5 kg of waste material each determined the mean pyrolysisproduct distribution.3.3 Pyrolysis productsApproximately 45wt% of thewaste is converted to pyrolysis oil (cf. Figure 2); 2 wt% is converted to an aqueous condensate. Pyrolysis gasmakes up18wt%, while 31 wt% is retained as pyrolysis residue, consisting of mineral fillers, glass fibers, andmetals. On average, 4 wt% of the sample weightis lost (balance loss) due to encrustations within the reactor and measuring inaccuracies. Elemental analysis of condensates shows that pyrolysisoil contains approximately 80 wt% carbon and 12 wt% hydrogen (cf. Table S1-7, Supporting Information S1). The pyrolysis oil contains 8 wt% ofheteroatoms, the main share being oxygen and 1 wt% water. The chlorine content in the pyrolysis oil is below 0.1 wt%. Pyrolysis gas consists ofcarbon dioxide as a principal component. Additionally, it contains significant amounts of C1 to C4 hydrocarbons and a minor amount of hydrogen.A detailed overview of pyrolysis product distribution, composition, and element mass balances of pyrolysis is given in section A2 of the supportinginformation.3.4 Utilization of pyrolysis productsPyrolysis oil can be used as feedstock for steam cracking to produce ethene and propene (Kusenberg et al., 2022b). However, steam cracker speci-fications regarding heteroatom and olefin content require an additional hydroprocessing step for upgrading pyrolysis oil (Kusenberg et al., 2022c).The gas from the pyrolysis of APWcontains valuable C3 andC4olefins, but the low gas yield and a high share of carbon dioxide prevent thematerial 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

Instead, it can be used as fuel for the pyrolysis process heat required having a net caloric value of 19MJ/kg. Pyrolysis residue (9MJ/kg) andaqueous condensate (−2MJ/kg) must be disposed of and can also serve as fuel for process heat generation.4 LIFE CYCLE INVENTORY DATAGeneral assumptions and parameters for the assessments are summarized in Table S1-2 in Supporting Information S1, and additional detailed LCIdata is also provided in (Section A3, Supporting Information S1). The following subsections describe the subprocesses and LCI data for the differentend-of-life options.4.1 APW collectionA disposal company collects APW from automotive workshops and supplies it to RDF producers. The economic assessment of the disposal com-pany is limited to the material-specific treatment costs considered in theMFCA. The cost associated with a transfer station is up to 0.02€/kg input(Bilitewski et al., 2018). Environmental impacts are not assessed as they are assigned to transport burdens only (Section 4.8).4.2 RDF productionAPW is shredded and sorted. A share of 9% metals can be recovered and separated into ferrous (39%) and non-ferrous metals (61%). An analysisof the non-ferrous metals in the feedstock sample for the pyrolysis experiments demonstrates the domination of aluminum and copper (>90%)with a balancedmass ratio between them. Thus, we calculate with a share of 50% aluminum and 50% copper for all non-ferrous metal by-products.Process costs include electricity costs and fixed operating costs of 10% (Larrain et al., 2020; Riedewald et al., 2021) of the investment. Investments,electricity costs, and environmental impacts for an RDF production plant with a capacity of 20,000Mg/year and operating 7500 h/year are derivedfrom an exemplary production process based on manufacturer specifications that are scaled up to the assessed capacity, and by employing a plantfactor (Stapf et al., 2019). The investment addsup to880,000€/year; operationexpenses result in 0.06€/kg input. Environmental impacts arederivedfrom the process’s electrical energy demand of 1.17MJ/kg input multiplied by the German CO2 and CED factors of the electricity grid (Table S1-2,Supporting Information S1). The CO2 factor describes the CO2 emissions associated with producing 1 kWh of electricity. In contrast, the CEDfactor describes the primary energy needed to generate 1 kWh of usable energy. Both factors also exist for the German heat mix. The mechanicalpre-treatment has environmental impacts of 2.80MJ/kg input (CED) and 0.14 kgCO2/kg input (climate change impact). The LCI data is summarizedin Table S1-8 (Supporting Information S1).4.3 Metal recyclingSeparated metals are sent to conventional recycling processes. Their environmental impacts are derived from ecoinvent datasets,2 and process-ing costs are based on energy demand. The environmental rewards for substituting iron scrap in steel production are also based on an ecoinventdataset3; the financial compensation is assumed with 0.025€/kg (Stapf et al., 2019). For aluminum and copper, a compensation of 0.25€/kg (Stapfet al., 2019) is assumed, and environmental rewards are derived from respective ecoinvent datasets4.4.4 Energy recoveryRelevant data for the incineration in MSWI plants and RDF power plants is provided in Table S1-9 (Supporting Information S1). Processing costsare assumed to be 0.12€/kg input (Bilitewski et al., 2018), and the environmental impacts are calculated to be 26.3 MJ/kg input (CED) and2.47 kg CO2/kg input (climate change impact) based on the APW’s elemental composition. Rewards are calculated based on the efficiency of theenergy recovery facilities, the recovered energy (electricity and heat), and respective CO2 and CED factors of the recovered energy.4.5 PyrolysisThe pyrolysis plant converts RDF to pyrolysis oil, pyrolysis gas, and pyrolysis residues. Mass and elemental balances are closed by adding balancelosses to the pyrolysis residue fraction. Adjusted experimental data for a metal-free feedstock is used for product distribution and composition(Section A3.3, Supporting Information S1). 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseSTALLKAMP ET AL. 7Pyrolysis oil is sent to a hydroprocessing unit for upgrading to steam cracker specifications (Section 4.6). The incineration of pyrolysisby-products supplies thehigh-temperature heat demandof thepyrolysis unit. Excess low-temperature heat is supplied to adistrict heating network.The remaining ashes are landfilled. Climate change impact and CED of pyrolysis are calculated based on the amount of carbon dioxide releasedfrom the incineration of pyrolysis by-products (i.e., pyrolysis gas, pyrolysis residue, and aqueous condensates) (climate change impact) and theirrespective net calorific value (CED). Rewards are granted for excess heat substituting conventionally derived district heating. This results in a netclimate change impact of 0.51 kg CO2/kg input (Section A3.3, Supporting Information S1) and a net CED of 4.49MJ/kg input. Total processing costsare estimated to be 0.16 €/kg input.4.6 HydroprocessingRaw pyrolysis oil has to be upgraded to fulfill the demands of the petrochemistry processes designed for fossil feedstocks (Kusenberg et al., 2022c).This includes removing heteroatoms and saturation of double bonds by hydrotreating and adjusting the pyrolysis oil boiling curve by hydrocracking.Pyrolysis oil differs from conventional feedstocks mainly in terms of oxygen content and the occurrence of double bonds. Only little researchhas been conducted on the hydroprocessing of pyrolysis oil from plastic waste. However, for pyrolysis oil from polyolefinic plastic waste, it has beendemonstrated on a laboratory scale that upgrading pyrolysis oil is feasible (Neuner et al., 2022). Therefore, the composition of hydroprocessedpyrolysis oil and the demand for hydrogen is estimated based on general assumptions (Section A3.4, Supporting Information S1). Nevertheless,further investigation of the hydroprocessing process for pyrolysis oil is necessary to validate the assumptions made.A part of the estimated amount of hydrogen needed for hydroprocessing can be separated from steam cracker product gas (Section 4.7).Required additional hydrogen is assumed to be purchased. Here, we calculate with hydrogen produced as a by-product in an oil refinery. Associ-ated environmental impacts are based on an ecoinvent dataset (Brunner, 2021), and prices are assumed to be 1575€/MgH2 (Bundestag, 2020). Thehydroprocessed pyrolysis oil is sent to the steam cracker. Due to lacking information, a detailed hydroprocessing simulation is impossible. Thus, noenergy demands for pumps and gas compression can be calculated, and estimating climate change impact and CED is not possible. In addition, nocredits or burdens are considered for treating hydroprocessing by-products and utilization of excess hydrogen.Hydroprocessing costs are considered in terms of fixed operating expenses and costs for hydrogen, as no energy demands are known. The invest-ment for hydroprocessing is based on a hydroprocessing unit for vegetable oil (Marker et al., 2005) with costs for hydroprocessing of 0.10 €/kginput.4.7 Steam crackingIt is assumed that hydroprocessed pyrolysis oil replaces naphtha as steam-cracking feedstock. The LCI for producing primary HVC is used(PlasticEurope, 2012a); no further detailed assessment of steam cracking is performed. The assumed product yield is based on the steam-crackingprocess with naphtha feedstock (Figure S1-2, Supporting Information S1).4.8 TransportationAssumptions and references for the transport distances are summarized in Table S1-12 (Supporting Information S1). Based on a spatial analysis forGermany, total transportation distances between automotive workshops, disposal companies, RDF production, and energy recovery are 115 km.For chemical recycling, instead of MSWI or RDF power plants, the average distance between RDF production and chemical plants with Germansteam crackers is considered. The spatial analysis results in an average distance of 247 km. Transportation for pyrolysis products or hydropro-cessed pyrolysis oil is not considered sincewe assume the integration of pyrolysis and hydroprocessing into existing chemical plants. Environmentalimpacts and costs are provided in the Supporting Information (Section A3.6, Supporting Information S1).5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe environmental impacts and economic assessment of energy recovery and chemical recycling are calculated based on the experimental and LCIdata collected.5.1 Energy recovery scenariosThe baseline scenario of the energy recovery results in gross costs of 0.34€/kg input and induces gross values of 2.73 kg CO2e/kg input (climatechange impact) and 31.80 MJ/kg input (CED). All RDF is incinerated in either an MSWI or RDF power plant. Incineration accounts for 83% of the 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F. Technologie, Wiley Online Library on [12/07/2023].

The net values consider substitution rewards for energy and primary metals, resulting in aneconomic assessment of−0.02 €/kg input (Figure 3), 1.25 CO2e/kg input (climate change impact, Figure 4), and 7.97MJ/kg input (CED, Figure 5).The results (Figures 4 and 5) show that the energy recovery in RDF power plants (scenario 1.2) leads to net reductions of 7% (climate changeimpact) and 13% (CED) compared to the baseline scenario 1.1. The economic assessment improves by 89% (Figure 3). The higher energy efficiencyof RDF power plants and associated substitution rewards achieve the improvements.5.2 Chemical recycling (pyrolysis) scenariosChemical recycling of APW (scenario 2.1) results in gross processing costs of 0.49€/kg input and induces gross values of 1.54 kg CO2e/kg input(climate change impact) and 33.69 MJ/kg input (CED). It leads to HVCs production of 0.13 kg ethene, 0.06 kg propene, 0.04 kg butadiene, and0.08 kg pyrolysis gasoline (Figure 6). Figure 6 also outlines the carbon flow of the chemical recycling route, indicating the share of carbon that canpotentially be recovered and contribute to a circular economy. Steam cracking significantly impacts all indicators5 due to its high energy demandand emissions. Pyrolysis substantially influences the cost of the chemical recycling path (36%) due to increased investments and a high impact onthe environmental indicators6 due to the incineration of the pyrolysis by-products providing process heat. The net values of scenario 2.1 are aneconomic assessment of 0.08 €/kg input, 0.57 kg CO2e/kg input (climate change impact), and a CED of 3.38MJ/kg input.In scenario 2.2, a decrease in pyrolysis oil yield is assumed, and the mass balance difference is allocated to the solid fraction. Thus, moresolids are incinerated, increasing climate change impact and CED. Higher rewards for recovered energy do not fully compensate for thisincrease, leading to a net climate change impact of 0.64 kg CO2e/kg input. The CED impact increases to 4.41 MJ/kg input. The net process-ing costs along the value chain decrease to 0.05€/kg input because the high energy prices make the revenues from recovered heat higher thanthose from produced HVCs. The reduced pyrolysis oil yield results in fewer produced HVCs and less carbon potentially available for a circulareconomy. 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

Assessment for 1 kg of input waste. Theunderlying data used to create this figure can be found in Supporting Information S2.5.3 Comparison of energy recovery and chemical recycling (pyrolysis)Economically, energy recovery performs better than chemical recycling. This is due to high rewards for producing and substituting energy and lowergross processing costs due to fewer processing steps along the value chain. Energy recovery performs even better using more efficient RDF powerplants with higher rewards for recovered energy and lower emissions. Economically, chemical recycling performs better with a lower pyrolysis oilyield due to an increased share of incinerated material and associated rewards for providing excess heat. Lower pyrolysis oil yields also result inlower processing costs at the steam-cracking plant, and the higher rewards for substitute district heating compensate for lower rewards for theavoided primary production of HVCs. This is an effect of the high energy prices in 2021 used in the assessment.The climate change impact of the energy recovery scenarios is influenced by the incineration paths and their efficiencies (Figure 4). Incinerationin efficient RDF power plants reduces the climate change impact compared toMSWI plants due to higher substitution rewards for generated heatand electricity. Regarding climate change impact, chemical recycling performs considerably better than energy recovery. Rewards for substitutingprimary HVCs counterbalance the high impacts of steam cracking and pyrolysis. In the chemical recycling scenarios, the impact of climate changeincreases with decreasing pyrolysis oil yield.The CED impact of energy recovery decreases with more efficient incineration paths as more electricity and heat can be recovered (Figure 5).Both chemical recycling scenarios show lower CED impacts compared to the energy recovery. The CED savings decrease with decreasing pyrolysisoil yield as fewer HVCs are produced. This leads to lower rewards for the avoided primary production that cannot be compensated by increasingrewards for recovered energy.In addition to the environmental benefits, chemical recycling can potentially contribute to a circular economy closing the carbon cycle. However,mass and elemental balances for carbon recovery demonstrate that a high pyrolysis oil yield is advantageous when the goal is to contribute to acircular economy. 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

The underlying data used to create this figure can be found in Supporting Information S2.5.4 Sensitivity analysisThe sensitivity analysis focuses on processing costs and the global warming potential and was conducted for both baseline scenarios. An overviewof the analyses is provided in Figure 7.5.4.1 Energy costs and electricity mixSensitivity analysis Sen1 and Sen2 analyze the effect of electricity prices and electricity revenues with an increase (Sen1) and a decrease of 10%(Sen2). Sen1 results in a 15%decrease in the total costs of energy recovery (Figure 7) as revenues for recovered energy from incineration are higherthan increased electricity costs at the RDFproducer. The electricity cost increase of RDFproduction increases the total costs for chemical recyclingby 9%. Sen2 leads to a 15% increase in the total costs of energy recovery and a 9% decrease in chemical recycling.Sen3 assumes an electric power supply mix that includes more fossil energy sources by a 10% increased CO2 factor of the electricity mix. Sen4considers amoredecarbonizedelectricity supplybya10%decreasedCO2 factor.While the carbondioxideemissions fromAPWincineration remainunaltered, financial rewards for substituting electricity change due to the CO2 emission fees associated with conventional electricity generation.In Sen3, this causes a decrease in the total net cost by 13%. The total cost of chemical recycling is not impacted, as only heat and no electricity issubstituted.Higher emissions associatedwith the electricity used forRDFproduction lead to a3%higher climate change impact on energy recoveryand a 2% higher climate change impact for chemical recycling compared to their respective baselines. Sen4 results in a 13% increase in the costsof energy recovery, while the costs for chemical recycling do not change. The climate change impact of energy recovery decreases by 3%, while theclimate change impact for chemical recycling decreases by 2%.Sen5 and Sen6 analyze the influence of a 10% increase and decrease in the CO2 emission price. A 10% increase (Sen5) causes a 31% increase inenergy recovery costs since incineration costs increasemore than the rewards for the recovered energy. For chemical recycling, a cost increase forCO2 emissions from steam cracking is compensated by increasing rewards for recovered energy resulting in a 2% increase in total processing costs.The variations are symmetrical and do not influence the climate change impact. 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F.

The underlying data used to create this figure can be found in Supporting Information S2.5.4.2 Chemical recyclingSen7 and Sen8 estimate the effects of changing the energy demandof the pyrolysis process thatmay occurwhen it is scaled up to an industrial scale.The energy demand is increased by 10% (Sen7) and decreased by 10% (Sen8). The variations impact the processing costs of chemical recycling thatincrease or decrease by 10% as revenues from district heat vary. The climate change impact increases (Sen7) and decreases (Sen8) by 1% due tovariations in the amount of heat substituted and associated burdens.In Sen9 and Sen10, the avoided costs of the primary production of HVCs are varied. When conventional HVC production cost increase by 10%(Sen9), the chemical recycling cost decrease by 6% due to higher financial rewards for HVC. A 10% decrease in conventional HVC production costs(Sen10) leads to a 6% increase in chemical recycling costs.5.5 Comparison with other studiesThere is no literature onAPWpyrolysis. Therefore, the established data and results cannot be directly comparedwith other experimental data. Thebest comparison is the ASR pyrolysis on a similar experimental scale conducted by Notarnicola et al. (2017) and Galvagno et al. (2001). At similartemperatures (450–500◦C), ASR yields almost double the amount of char (ca. 50%) and considerably less pyrolysis oil (20%–30%) in comparison tothe pyrolysis of APW (31% char, 49% pyrolysis oil). The same is observed in laboratory-scale experiments (Joung et al., 2007; Santini et al., 2012;Zolezzi et al., 2004). Despite variations in the reported composition of ASR and pyrolysis product distribution in different studies, it can still beconcluded that APW generally yields higher amounts of pyrolysis oil due to a higher share of polymers in the feedstock material. However, ASR isavailable in much higher quantities.Only a few studies assess recycling paths for automotive plastics regarding environmental or economic indicators. Ciacci et al. (2010) andPassarini et al. (2012) compare ASR treatment processes in an LCA. They both include chemical recycling or feedstock recycling. However, their 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F. Technologie, Wiley Online Library on [12/07/2023].

The thermal treatment with energy recovery is designed as co-combustion with municipal solid waste (Ciacci et al., 2010; Passarini et al., 2012). Therefore, the results are also not comparable because of thedifferent characteristics of the waste streams inMSWI plants.However, Ciacci et al. (2010) and Passarini et al. (2012) indicate that advanced recycling technologies, such as chemical recycling, show betterenvironmental performance than energy recovery. This is consistent with this study. Arena and Ardolino (2022) analyze the recovery of polymersfrom hard-to-handle plastic waste streams such as EoL vehicles. In their environmental assessment, they also include catalytic pyrolysis and energyrecovery. Their assessment is based on a feedstock of single polymers and not an actual waste fraction. Therefore, the results are not entirely 15309290, 0, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.13416 by Karlsruher Inst F. Technologie, Wiley Online Library on [12/07/2023].

Cardamoneet al. (2022) environmentally assess plastic recycling options for ASR with an extruder and pyrolysis combination. This waste-handling option ispart of a recycling scheme that outperforms the current energy recovery option (Cardamone et al., 2022). They indicate that pyrolysis could bemore environmentally beneficial than energy recovery, assuming a very optimistic pyrolysis oil yield. However, due to the chosen feedstock andprocess design of the chemical recycling, the results are only partially comparable to the results of this study. Other studies, for example, Li et al.(2016) and Chen et al. (2019), conduct an LCA for automobile recycling but do not include the chemical recycling of ASR.5.6 LimitationsThis study has limitations and faces uncertainties due to (1) data and methodology, (2) model limits, and (3) assumptions. First, regarding (1) dataandmethodology: This study analyses awaste fractionwith a comparatively low volume compared toASR.However, thewaste fraction of APWcanbecome highly relevant if the dismantling of large plastic components becomes part of automobiles’ EoL treatment processes. According to Wiltset al. (2016), dismantling could increase the amount of separated plastics available for recycling by a factor of six. Also, mixed plasticwaste fractionsseparated from ASR by post-shredder-treatment processes have shown similar behavior in pyrolysis as the APW used in this study (Zeller et al.,2021).The experiments demonstrate that the pyrolysis of engineering thermoplastics is technically feasible, and there is an environmentally beneficialalternative to their incineration.However, data for the subsequent hydroprocessing is unavailable yet, and very general assumptions had to be used.Also, this study does not consider other chemical recycling technologies besides pyrolysis.Mechanical recycling options and a combinedmechanicaland chemical recycling approach are also excluded. However, mechanical recycling processes for automotive plastics, like Sparenberg (2021) or theVWSicon Process (Krinke et al., 2008), focus on separating standard thermoplastics and cannot handle engineering thermoplastics.Second, this study has model limitations (2): The study assesses a defined waste stream of APW fromworkshop repair jobs with a specific com-position towhich the results are limited. The assessment is based on calculations for Germany. However, they are generic and can be transferred tocountries with similar conditions. Nevertheless, this study does not consider dynamics such as changing waste compositions.Third, assumptions (3) introduce uncertainties that are partly covered by scenarios (Section 2.3) and sensitivity analysis (Section 5.4). However,assumptions regarding hydroprocessing (Section 4.6) are not covered due to missing data. All processing facilities with direct CO2 emissions areassumed to be covered within the EU emission trading system. No national emission trading systems are included in the assessment, indicating apossible extension. In reality, a mix of scenarios and sensitivities is likely, due to differing plant efficiencies, variable waste compositions, yields, andqualities of the pyrolysis products.6 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOKThepyrolysis experiments demonstrate the technical feasibility of the pyrolysis ofAPWcontaining engineering thermoplastics. Based on the exper-imental results, energy recovery and chemical recycling of APW to HVCs via pyrolysis are assessed, compared, and analyzed in different scenariosregarding their climate change impact, CED, and processing costs. The results show that chemical recycling has lower net environmental impactsthan energy recovery, while, under current market conditions, energy recovery performs better economically. Therefore, this study identifies aconflict between the economic and environmental objectives of EoL options for APW. The sensitivity analysis shows that the price and revenueassociated with electricity and the carbon emission price significantly impact the assessment. Here, the assessed indicators for energy recoverycorrelate stronger with the varied parameters than for chemical recycling.Chemical recycling also has the potential to keep carbon in the material cycle. The gained pyrolysis oil is a valuable petrochemical feedstockand can be used in different processes, for example, to produce new primary plastics. Therefore, the chemical recycling of APW can contribute toa circular economy by closing the carbon and the automotive plastic loop. Additional research is needed to provide experimentally validated datafor the hydroprocessing of the produced pyrolysis oil. Further research should also address the potential of mechanical recycling processes forengineering thermoplastics, alternative feedstock utilization paths of pyrolysis oil with lower quality demands than steam cracking, and scenarioswhen technologies are combined. This can contribute to designing and optimizing recycling systems for complexmixed plastic wastes.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSChristoph Stallkamp: Data curation; formal analysis; investigation; methodology; writing—original draft; writing—review and editing.
