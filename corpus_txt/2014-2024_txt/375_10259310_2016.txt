The main components of Urban WasteIntroduction If citizens separate erroneously urban waste fractions, they produce both environmental and economic damages.Packaging wasteIntroduction On the base of the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), a Municipality receives an economic amount for each kilogram of packaging waste collected. In Italy, this activity is managed by CONAI (a private system, created and designed by companies). The “CONAI system” is based on the activities of six consortia each dedicated to promoting and control the most used materials in the packaging production i.e. steel, aluminum, paper, wood, plastics and glass.Packaging wasteIntroduction Packaging waste that goes into the residue represents an economic damage (a loss of the “CONAI contribution” and the payment of the disposal fees) as well as an environmental burden.Packaging wasteIntroductionImproving the efficiency of source separationIntroductionPutrescibles_1Paper and cardboard_1Plastics_1Glass_1Metals_1Putrescibles_2Paper and cardboard_2Plastics_2Glass_2Metals_2unsorted residual municipal waste (2)(‘residue’)sorted municipal waste (1)improving the efficiency of source separationA ‘perfect’ source separate collection systemIntroductionPutresciblesPaper and cardboardPlasticsGlassMetals100% sortedurban waste100% efficiency of source separation0% residueA ‘better’ source separate collection systemIntroductionPutrescibles_1Paper and cardboard_1Plastics_1Glass_1Metals_1Putrescibles_2Paper and cardboard_2Plastics_2Glass_2Metals_2(100-X)% sorted urban waste (1)X% residue (2)environmental education campaigns(100-X)% efficiency of the separate collection system The environmental and economic evaluation was performed for the case study of Nola (39.19 km², 34.349 inhabitants, and 876.47 ab./km²) in the Province on Naples, in the Campania Region of Southern Italy. Nola has a kerbside system which assured a percentage of separate collection of 61% in 2015.The case study areaMaterials and methodsJune Lily Festival of NolaNola The LCA analysis included the treatment and disposal phases as well as the collection and transport phases.Phases included in the LCA analysisMaterials and methods The LCA software tool: SimaPro Impact assessment methods: ReCiPe 2008 (for the medium-term perspective Hierarchist both for midpoint and endpoint levels) Ecological footprint IPCC 2013 (100 years) LCA software tool and Impacts categoriesMaterials and methods The environmental and economic analysis were developed for different real and hypothetical scenarios based on: increasing percentages of separate collection, and different composition analyses of urban waste. 2013 (hp1) (real%) 2014 (hp1) (real%)• 2014 (hp1) (65%)• 2014 (hp1) (70%)• 2014 (hp1) (75%)• 2014 (hp1) (80%) 2014 (hp2) (real%) 2014 (hp3) (real%) 2014 (hp4) (real%)The scenarios analysedMaterials and methodsComposition analysis hypothesisMaterials and methods0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%hp_1hp_2hp_3hp_4Putrescibles Paper and Cardboard GlassAluminium Steel PET plasticHDPE plastic Mix plastic Discard plasticsEconomic hypothesisMaterials and methods€ 75.00€ 350.00€ 74.25€ 203.24€ 25.250 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600SteelAluminumPaper and CardboardPlasticGlassMax (€/ton) Mean (€/ton) Min (€/ton)€ 0€ 50,000€ 100,000€ 150,000€ 200,000€ 250,000€ 300,000€ 350,000€ 400,000€ 450,000€ 500,000€ 550,000CollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectibleCollectedCollectible2013(hp1)2014(hp1)2014(hp1)(65%)2014(hp1)(70%)2014(hp1)(75%)2014(hp1)(80%)2014(hp2)2014(hp3)2014(hp4)Plastic Paper Steel Aluminum GlassMoneys for Collected and Collectible materialsResults20142013-1465-80%different composition analysis hypothesisReCiPe 2008 single endpointResults-950-850-750-650-550-450-350-250-150-50501502502013(hp1)2014(hp1)2014(hp1)(65%)2014(hp1)(70%)2014(hp1)(75%)2014(hp1)(80%)2014(hp2)2014(hp3)2014(hp4)ReCiPe2008 (kPt)Treatment/disposal External Transport -
