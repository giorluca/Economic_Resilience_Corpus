Dec. 2021 Understanding regional resilience and the role of institutions in establishing policy and practice  Richard Smith  September 2021 By             Understanding regional resilience and the role of institutions in establishing policy and practice  Richard Smith  September 2021 By  A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the University’s requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy                                 ABSTRACT The concept of regional resilience has been used by researchers to examine patterns of uneven development, and to explore factors which contribute to the varied ability of regions to adapt to economic change. The financial crisis of 2007-2008, and the ensuing Great Recession, brought increased usage of the concept in academic research. Despite this being accompanied by significant conceptual discussion of the term, regional resilience remains a contested concept, with little consensus on definition or utility among academic researchers Within the literature on regional resilience there remains a disconnect between policy and practice and the theoretical definitions developed in academic research. Additionally, despite a significant body of research focussing on institutions in regional policy, the role of institutions, agency, and the way in which policy approaches related to regional resilience are made remains an underdeveloped area of research. Previous research has largely focused on explaining structural influences on the way in which regional economies evolve, with much less consideration of the activities, actions, and motivations of those seeking to actively shape this development. This thesis contributes to the understanding of regional resilience through exploring the policy making perspective to examine the extent to which the concept is reflected in policy and practice, and how specific institutional contexts influence approaches to regional resilience. To achieve this the thesis develops a novel analytical framework which conceptualises the key features of academic definitions of regional resilience and links these to policy approaches and actions.  The research comprising in-depth policy review and interviews with senior policy makers reveals distinct policy perspectives on regional resilience in two case studies contexts, which are fundamentally rooted in established institutional arrangements and institutional environments. In the Tees Valley the approach is predominantly a business-focussed form of policy for regional resilience, in Southern Denmark the prevailing form of regional resilience policy has a human capital–focus. The analytical framework developed for this research was used to help demonstrate that regional resilience is a relevant and useful lens through which to understand particular policy approaches to anticipation and management of economic change and to explore the nature of economic growth policy makers seek to foster. The research also reveals approaches to regional resilience to be complex, a process which blends strategic and pragmatic approaches to anticipation and management of economic change, and to be heavily conditioned by factors outside of the region.  For sub-national policy, the thesis demonstrates that regional resilience can be used to provide a novel way of understanding the focus and form of regional growth policy. Analysing regions in this way can be useful in the design and implementation of devolution settlements which facilitate effective place-based policy making. More fundamentally, this insight encourages policy makers to consider the kind of regional growth they seek, the importance of resilience to it, and therefore, who benefits from public policy interventions.

research   The notion of regional resilience has been increasingly used as a way for academic researchers to conceptualise and analyse the varied performance of regions over the past decade. Fundamentally, regional resilience is concerned with the exploration of the factors which determine the process of adaption to economic change and explores factors which impact the adaptability of regions. Use of the concept has increased since the global financial crisis in 2007 -2008, this event was followed by wide-spread recession across Europe and globally – a period termed the great recession. This period of economic contraction had significantly varied impacts on the regions of Europe, with some showing a greater ability to withstand economic contraction and retain existing economic strengths or evolving to adapt to new development paths (Brackman et al., 2015; Crescenzi et al, 2016; ESPON, 2014; European Commission, 2019; Fingleton et al., 2012).  Academic researchers have defined Regional resilience in two principal ways. Firstly, equilibrist definitions, define resilience as the ability of a region to maintain or return to previous levels of output and/or employment following economic shocks or major closures. This can be through ‘engineering resilience’ – the ability to return to the same state, or ‘ecological resilience’ – the ability to form a new state (Fingleton et al., 2012; Isaksen, 2014; Simmie and Martin, 2010; Swanstrom, 2008). Secondly, resilience has been defined through use of evolutionary perspectives, which reject equilibrist definitions and assert that regions are in state of constant change with no settled equilibrium (Boschma, 2014; Bristow and Healey, 2010; Davies, 2011; Dawley, 2014; Martin, 2012; Martin and Sunley, 2015; Pike et al., 2010).   Despite increased usage, the concept of regional resilience has no widely agreed definition, with some researchers questioning the utility of the concept when considered alongside the range of analytical concepts already available for researchers concerned with uneven development (Hassink, 2010; Hudson, 2009; Gong & Hassink, 2017; Pendall et al., 2010; Wink, 2014). An additional criticism of the concept is a perceived over concentration on systems analysis and a neglect of the role of human agency in shaping outcomes (typically growth metrics such as employment and gross value added) which are frequently used in research to measure relative degrees of resilience (Bristow and Healey, 2014; Christopherson et al., 2010; Hudson, 2010; Wolfe 2010).   Accompanying these discussions have been increased interest among policy makers and researchers regarding the nature of economic growth (Bristow, 2005; Harvey, 1982;   2  Morgan, 2004, Pike et al. 2010) and specifically on the potential benefits of place-based policy and the reorganisation of institutional arrangements through devolution of powers and responsibilities for economic development over the last decade (Bachtler et al., 2016; Barca et al, 2012; Solly, 2016).  However, such discussions have not been effectively linked with conceptual debates of the utility and definition of regional resilience, with discussions of regional resilience largely neglecting the role of regional stakeholders and institutions in shaping specific forms of regional resilience. There are, therefore, important gaps in understanding policymaker perspectives, and the role of policy in shaping specific forms of regional resilience. This research develops the understanding of regional resilience through exploring the policy making perspective to understand the extent to which the concept is reflected in policy and practice, and how specific institutional contexts influence approaches to regional resilience. Ultimately the thesis shows how the concept of regional resilience can be useful as a way of contributing to discussion of how policy makers can anticipate and manage economic change and the form of economic growth that they seek to foster.  This is achieved by undertaking a review of policy and analysing the relationship between definitions of regional resilience and established policy and practices. The study then uses two case studies, Tees Valley in the UK, and the region of Southern Denmark, to explore the process and development of specific approaches to regional resilience, examining the role institutional arrangements and institutional environments play in establishing approaches to regional resilience.  Each of these regions have undergone significant economic and labour market restructuring over the past decade following the decline of previously dominant industries. The thesis reveals regional resilience to be a very useful analytical lens through which to explain and examine the approaches that each region has taken to anticipation and management of economic change.  What emerges is two distinct perspectives of regional resilience. In Southern Denmark there is a concentration on investment in human capital to support market trends, the approach in the Tees Valley places greater emphasis on the region reflecting national industrial strategy to attract investment, providing strategic and direct forms of support to companies. In each case the approach to regional resilience is situated within an overall appreciation of the place of regional industries and assets within global value chains.   The two case studies each demonstrate that the prevailing approaches to regional resilience are firmly rooted in the established institutional arrangements and institutional environments. However, the dominance of national framework conditions in shaping the   3  boundaries within which these regional institutional conditions develop resilience-related policy is equally clear. In this respect the research the thesis provides a challenge to the ‘regional’ nature of resilience. The distinct policy approaches to regional resilience are also demonstrated to be established through a complex process involving endogenous and exogenous factors which shape strategic and pragmatic approaches which are heavily conditioned by factors outside of the region. The thesis demonstrates that regional resilience offers a useful concept through which policy makers can consider the design and implementation of sub-national institutions which facilitate effective place-based policy making.  1.2 Key concepts and themes for this research  This thesis explores the concept of resilience in regional development.  In regional development research and analysis resilience has been increasingly used as a concept within which to try and understand the process and specific factors which contribute to the uneven nature of economic and social change within and across regions. The following sub-sections introduce the key themes and concepts for the research before briefly outlining the research questions which are investigated.    These themes provide the focus for the research as it seeks to engage with issues of the extent to which regional policy makers operate within a changing context to develop approaches to regional resilience. The themes introduced below are discussed in detail in Chapter 2.      1.2.1 The changing organisation and widening scope of regional policy There is a significant body of academic research examining uneven development and, in particular, the process of adaption and influences on adaptability at regional level and local level (for example, Marshall, 1920; Massey, 1995; Martin and Sunley, 2006). One of the reactions to this has been an increasing tendency across Europe toward devolution of powers and responsibilities from central government to regions, this has taken varied forms between, and often within, the countries of Europe, altering the way in which economic development is organised within regions (Armstrong & Taylor, 2000; Bachtler, 2007; OECD, 2005).  Accompanying this increased devolution of powers and responsibilities to regions has been a greater concentration on place-based economic development policy, which emphasises the importance of tackling specific local market failures or persistent   4  inefficiencies which inhibit economic growth at local and regional level, particularly among certain geographic areas and / or among particular groups (Barca, 2009).  Additionally, there has been an increased awareness among policy makers and businesses that globalisation and increasing free trade have increased the inter-dependency of regional economies (Amin, 1998, Keohane & Nye, 2000; Storper, 1995, Weiss, 1999). In some respects, this has increased uncertainty and vulnerability to rapid market adjustment and economic crisis (Camagni & Capello, 2012; Fratesi, 2012; Rodrik, 2018). As such, the concepts of adaption and adaptability and consideration of ways in which people, businesses and places may better anticipate and manage change through becoming more resilient and adaptable have assumed increasing importance.  1.2.2 Definitions of regional resilience The concept of regional resilience has been used in academic research to understand the process of adaption and the factors which influence adaptability to economic change for regions. Despite increased usage of the term over the past decade, regional resilience remains a contested concept, with no settled definition in research and little explicit use in policy statements. In academic studies definitions of regional resilience have been informed using thinking from a wide range of different disciplines, from mainstream economics to evolutionary science. The main definitions are briefly outlined below (and discussed fully in the literature review - Section 2), these encompass equilibrist and evolutionary perspectives. There are two main forms of equilibrist definitions of regional resilience. An important aspect they share is that each assert that regional economies have a tendency toward settled equilibrium. ‘Engineering resilience’ understands resilience to be determined by the ability of regions to resist change or return to a previously held development path. By contrast, ‘ecological resilience’ describes the ability of, or process by which regions establish a new settled development path, distinct from the previous one (Pendall et al., 2007). Such definitions typically relate to the management and recovery from a particular identified event or economic contraction.   Evolutionary definitions of regional resilience challenge the central assertion of equilibrist interpretations, which is that regional economies tend toward equilibrium or static states. Martin (2012) incorporates an evolutionary perspective in identifying four main dimensions of resilience: (a) resistance, which refers to how sensitive regional output and employment are to a shock; (b) recovery, how fast and comprehensively the region bounces back from a negative shock; (c) re-orientation, the extent to which a regional economy changes after   5  a shock; and, (d) renewal, the extent to which regional economies ‘renew’ their growth paths.  The evolutionary perspective on regional resilience includes distinct perspectives which stress the importance of various factors. The Darwinist perspective stresses the importance of individual firms and sees the resilience as a function of aggregate firm performance. Within this perspective the importance of agglomeration economies and related variety are stressed. A path dependency perspective stresses the importance of previous development paths and identifies forms of lock-in as key to adaption and/or levels of adaptive capacity. Lastly, a complex adaptive systems perspective stresses the dispersed agents within the system operating at different scales.      Where the concept of regional resilience has been applied in research it has most typically been to operationalise equilibrist definitions of resilience in order to measure relative degrees of resilience, comparing regional performance in terms of employment or growth (for example, Crescenzi et al., 2016; Cuadrado-Roura, et al., 2016; Doran & Fingleton, 2016; Sensier et al., 2016); and following specific plant closures or as a result of wider economic shocks (for example, Bailey & Berkeley, 2014, Christopherson et al. 2010, Holm, & Østergaard, 2015, Hudson, 2010, Pike et al. 2010, Simmie & Martin, 2010).   Where evolutionary definitions have been used, they have mainly been applied to describe sector life cycles and the influence of various technological developments within this process (for example, Dawley et al, 2015; Martin, 2012). These studies also identify the important role of changing political contexts which can provide regional policy makers with resources and political capital required to institute changes to previously settled development paths. These types of issues are discussed in more detail in the next section.    1.2.3 The role of institutions and agency in the formation of regional policy  Much research into the determinants of economic development which has sought to understand the role of various regional properties in economic performance has concluded that the quality of institutions may matter as much as, if not more so, than factors such as the physical assets, and human resources attributes, or trade or technology capacity (Rodriguez-Pose; 2013). Despite this there has been relatively little research which has explored the extent to which varied institutional arrangements and institutional environments may result in development and delivery of policies and practices which establish different forms of resilience in policy.       6  To understand institutions in the policy making process, it is useful to make a distinction between ‘institutional arrangements’ and the ‘institutional environment’, thus recognising a distinction between hard and soft institutions (Amin, 1999; Gertler, 2010; Rodriguez-Pose; 2013). In this respect hard institutions are traditionally seen as the key stakeholders within regional economic development, such as: the range of government organisations, business representatives, worker representatives, education providers, and civil society organisations. Hard institutions organise and operate within defined institutional arrangements. By contrast soft institutions, which include prevailing norms, traditions and social conventions, interpersonal contacts, relationships, and informal networks make up the institutional environment.  Regional  institutions operate within multi-scalar or multi-level governance structures which encompass vertical dimensions, such as the development of a set of relationships between supranational, national and sub-national governments; and horizontal dimensions, such as, the regional arrangements which increasingly involve non-governmental actors (for example, representatives from businesses, civil society organisations, labour unions) (Bache and Flinders, 2004; Sørenson, 2006; Piattoni, 2009). Such arrangements are not static and may change over time. These aspects of institutions do not play a significant role in academic definitions of regional resilience, this research addresses this gap in knowledge through considering the role of institutions in the process of forming resilience related policy and practice. Within these institutional settings, a number of researchers have explored the nature of agency and explored the extent to which different forms of agency exist and how they operate at a policy maker level. Grillitsch and Sotarauta (2018) identify different forms of agency - innovative entrepreneurship, institutional entrepreneurship, and place-leadership. This usefully highlights the level of dynamism in regional policy and provides useful considerations when exploring policy connected with anticipation and management of economic change. Gertler (2010) identified the importance of institutions in establishing the character and evolutionary trajectory of regional economies. However, the forms of agency identified by Grillitsch and Sotarauta (2018) are instructive of the dynamism and varied forms of agency explored by this thesis.              1.3 Aims and research questions The concepts and issues outlined in the previous section (which are discussed in more detail in the literature review) provide the context for the research aim and questions.  The primary aim of the thesis is to enhance the understanding of regional resilience through exploring to what extent policy makers reflect established definitions of the   7  concept and how specific institutional contexts operate to establish resilience-related policy. It is, therefore, firstly important to establish the overall relevance and application of the concept in policy and practice, and, secondly to explore how specific institutional contexts operate and influence the established approach to regional resilience. The research questions utilised to achieve this are outlined below.  Three specific research questions are addressed in this thesis. The first research question is addressed through desk review, research questions two and three draw on new case study research in the Tees Valley in the UK, and Southern Denmark: 1. To what extent does the focus of national labour market policies and practices related to anticipation and management of economic restructuring reflect existing definitions of regional resilience?   This research question analyses labour market policies and practices related to regional adaption to economic change in the UK and Ireland, and Nordic countries. The research question considers the extent to which policies and practices are consistent with academic definitions of regional resilience, the chapter considers policies and practices related to both anticipation and management of economic change. This research question uses in the analytical framework developed through the literature review to examine different elements of established policy and practice, including the role of policy makers in the process of resilience. This question contributes to the empirical understanding of the circumstances within which different approaches to regional resilience are mobilised in policy and how this relates to academic and theoretical understandings.  2. To what extent do regional policy makers understand, anticipate and respond to economic restructuring in ways that reflect existing understandings of regional resilience?      This question involves detailed consideration of how policy makers in the case study regions of Tees Valley and Southern Denmark define regional resilience. The research for this research question provides a detailed understanding of how stakeholders define regional resilience, exploring their views on key priorities in their specific spatial context. The policy making process in the case study regions is explored to understand the ways in which policy and practices related to regional resilience are conceived and delivered.  The findings from this research question contributes to developing a policy maker perspective on regional resilience, identifying the way that different stakeholders see the role of public policy in delivering resilience in their region. This analysis provides a novel understanding of how regional resilience is understood in policy and has important   8  implications for more accurate analysis of regional resilience which is more closely related to policy maker objectives. To date, most analysis has applied common metrics to conduct cross-regional comparison based on a commonly applied definition of regional resilience.  3. To what extent do regional institutional arrangements and institutional environments influence policy approaches to economic restructuring at regional level? How does this relate to existing definitions of regional resilience?  This research question assesses the way in which the policy process functions in case study regions, specifically examining the way in which particular institutional arrangements and institutional environments operate to mobilise notions of regional resilience.  Undertaking analysis of institutional arrangements and the institutional environment is particularly important because it demonstrates how these two linked, but distinct, elements operate in different regional contexts. This provides evidence to show the extent to which there are significantly developed place-based definitions of regional resilience.  The findings from this research question contribute to the understanding of the relative importance of institutions in the formation of distinct forms of place-based regional resilience policy and the way in which institutions are part of a process, both shaping policy possibilities and being shaped by policy maker understandings of regional resilience-related policy priorities.     1.4 Structure of the thesis The thesis is structured in the following way: ■ Chapter 2 provides a literature review which outlines the relevant academic and policy discussion which leads to the research questions. ■ Chapter 3 outlines the study methodology and the way that analysis has been undertaken.  ■ Chapter 4 uses the analytical framework established in the literature review and examines the extent to which policies and practices in the UK and Ireland and Nordic countries related to regional resilience are consistent with academic definitions of regional resilience drawing on a new review of published policy documents. ■ Chapters 5 and Section 6 present the findings from the case studies which discuss regional resilience policy approaches in two different regions and examines the way in which institutional arrangements and institutional environments operate in those regions.    9  o Chapter 5 analyses the Tees Valley which has established a predominantly business-focussed form of regional resilience  o Chapter 6 analyses Southern Denmark, which has established a predominantly human capital-focussed form of regional resilience  ■ Chapter 7 synthesises the findings from the case studies and reflects of the combined learning from them. ■ Chapter 8 details the conclusions and highlights implications for further research.      10  2 Literature Review  2.1 Introduction The literature review is structured in three main sections. The first half (Section 2.2) explores the process of adaption and the way in which a contested concept, regional resilience, has been used in academic research to understand reasons for varied patterns of development. It discusses aspects of the development of the regional resilience literature and explores the particular ways in which academic researchers have defined regional resilience. It also examines the role of institutions, specifically discussing the varied role of institutions and agency in the way that the concept has been defined and operationalised in research. This reveals that, despite significant use in research, regional resilience remains a contested concept, both in terms of its definition and contribution to research and policy within the existing range of conceptual and methodological tools. The section identifies some of the key elements and emphases within definitions of regional resilience, comparing and contrasting these factors as a basis for understanding what different notions of resilience may look like in policy and practice.   The second part of the literature review (Section 2.3) explores the issue of institutions and agency, discussing the ways in which these concepts relate to academic definitions of regional resilience. The section then reflects on the multi-scalar nature of regional policy making and discusses the role of policy and the scope for policy intervention within established equilibrist and evolutionary understandings of regional resilience.  This discussion establishes the ways in which different academic definitions of regional resilience place varying degrees of significance on different actors within the process of resilience. The section also discusses ways of conceptualising national frameworks within which regional resilience policy and practice are established, highlighting these frameworks as strong influences on shaping the institutional contexts within which regional approaches to resilience are enabled or restricted.       Lastly, in Section 2.4, the key issues which emerge from the literature review are summarised and used to develop an analytical framework which is used throughout the study. The framework is used to help identify policies and practices which are of particular relevance to regional resilience which allows for comparison in how institutional arrangements and institutional environments shape approaches to resilience at regional level (Chapter 4). The framework is then also used to guide the development of research tools and analysis in the case studies (Chapters 5-7).      11  2.2 The process of adaption and resilience in regional economic development This section explores the idea adaption in regional development and discusses the way in which academic research has conceptualised and applied ideas of adaption and adaptive capacity in research. These ideas are an inherent part of the regional resilience literature and thus help to ground the later discussion on regional resilience in the wider literature, identifying aspects which remain important in the way that researchers frame particular notions of regional resilience.       A large number of studies have examined the varied degrees of success with which regions and localities have been able to adapt when faced with the economic and labour market challenges and opportunities arising as a result of economic change. The idea of adaption has been important in consideration of how and why some regions have been more / less successful than others, particularly in respect of changes resulting from the process of deindustrialisation.  2.2.1 Regional adaptation and adaptive capacity   A significant volume of research has used the ideas of adaption and adaptability to examine the processes and varied success of regional change and diversification from previous development paths to new industries (Pike, et al., 2010; Hassink, 2010; Martin, 2012; Boschma, 2014). In his classic study, Grabher (1993) conceptualised adaption and adaptability as part of his study of firm dynamics in the Ruhr Valley in Germany. Grabher suggested that there was an inherent trade-off between adaption and adaptability. The author also explored various forms of lock-in (further discussed in the context of path dependency in section 2.2.2.2 of this thesis), concluding that loosely coupled networks of firms (rather than rigidly coupled networks) provide the most likely way for regions to avoid the danger that ‘adaption may lock a region into its trajectory and undermine its ability to learn and self-organise, that is. It may lead that region into the trap of rigid specialisation’ (Grabher, 1993. P. 275). These ideas remain important in the way that researchers operationalise ideas of regional resilience (as is discussed later in Section 2.2.2)    Grabher and Stark (1997) further developed these ideas in their study of post-socialist economies in Eastern Europe. This work concluded that short-run adaption in these economies (as they are subject to privatisation and development of new markets) is likely to lead to a loss of adaptability over the longer term through a loss of organisational diversity.  More recent research has focussed in to explore specific factors and drivers of change to research the process of adaption and identify drivers which may account for perceived greater or lesser success in adaption. This includes, for example, the   12  development of new growth paths (Isaksen & Trippl, 2014; Martin, 2010); regional economic diversification (Neffke, Henning, & Boschma, 2011); and factors which explain the varied ability of regions to make such changes. The main focus of these contributions has been on the process of regional adaption and varied ways in which adaptability plays out in different regions.       Settled definitions have developed around the concepts of adaption and adaptability. Adaptation is most commonly described as a process which is pre-conditioned by the experience and realities of prevailing development paths or primary functionalities of a system (Adger, 2010). As such, adaptability can be characterised as a path dependent process through which existing paths or primary functions of a system are maintained (Hu and Hassink, 2015), adaptation refers to the ability of a system to exhibit continuity through adjustment. Adaptability refers to the capability of a system to change, pursue new development paths and exhibit structural change, in short, the ability of a system to embrace possibilities for change through renewal.  Adaptation is based onto process adjustments within a regional economy, these changes are required as a result of developments within the overall trading environment(s) within which the regional economy operates. Adaption is not typically linked with economic shocks and short-term economic or labour market effects that occur as a result of such change. Rather the process of adaption is more closely associated with external market development, it is therefore also distinct from endogenously situated market developments / innovations that spring from within the region. Fundamentally then adaptation can be understood as a process of adjustments that result in, or aim for, growth / more economical performance of a regional economy. The process and form of adaption can be reactive and/or proactive as a reaction to endogenous development. (Martin, 2012, pp. 11-13). This idea of proactive and/or reactive actions is also developed in the discussion of regional resilience as it relates to the ways in which policy makers anticipate and manage economic change (section 2.2.2) and in terms of governance and policy (section 2.2.3).     Adaptability often refers to set of pliable attributes that can be moulded in to pursue new development paths and to reformulate the regional economy in the face of structural change (Pike et al., 2010; Boschma, 2015). Adaptability is also understood to be a property that is often revealed through endogenous economic shocks, with the idea being used as a way to understand the, often varied, ability of regional economies to “bounce-back” and also as a quality exhibited through regionally situated innovation (Hu, 2015; Martin et al., 2016).    13  In their conceptualisation of the concepts of adaption and adaptability, Grabher and Stark (1997), focussed largely on firm-level dynamics and argued that, where there were trade-offs between the two. They stressed that where there were strongly tied social agents, regional adaptability would be reduced because adaption (only) requires “exploiting known territory at the cost of forgetting (or never learning) the skills of exploring for new solutions’ (Grabher and Stark, 1997, 534).  The notion that there must be a trade-off between the two ideas has been a significant area of discussion among academic researchers exploring the idea of adaption and adaptability (Ibert & Schmidt, 2014; Mackinnon & Derickson, 2013; Martin & Sunley, 2006). Indeed, such discussion of the apparent trade-offs between adaption and adaptability is of particular significance for this research. Hu and Hassink (2017) note that in theorising regional resilience, adaption has tended to become linked to low levels of resilience, becoming synonymous with notions of resistance and recovery; whereas adaptability has been associated with re-orientation and renewal – and higher levels of resilience. The authors are critical of this so-called dualistic thinking which limits the utility of the ideas of adaption, adaptability and resilience thinking.   A number of other researchers have explored the ways in which adaptability and adaption can be conceptually complementary. Boschma (2015) explores sectoral composition and various forms of links between sectors. When discussing how regional economies may be more resilient, he concludes that achieving both adaption and adaptability simultaneously are the likely to most beneficial for a regional economy over the longer term. A number of other authors also assert the role of strategic actors at varying spatial levels in the process and identify their role as key facilitators of change. For example, Mackinnon and Derickson (2014) assert adaption and adaptability as a complex dynamic which is largely shaped within a multi-scalar institutional environment, involving state, capital, and labour operating at different spatial scales. Within this process it is important to understand varying power dynamics and incentives. Bristow and Healy (2018, p.147) also identify critical decisions and choices of a wide range of agents in the process such as, firms, governments, households, and workers.  These discussions are developed in more detail in this literature review through discussion of the characteristics of various academic definitions of regional resilience, the multi-scalar nature of institutions, and the nature of agency in regional policy making. It is important to note that in these discussions of adaption and adaptability there is a high level of recognition of various actors within the process, this is important for this research because the role and significance of various agents within the process of change remains   14  a contested element in the way in which regional resilience has been defined and operationalised. This aspect will be discussed in more detail in the next section.     2.2.2 Definitions of regional resilience  As described in the previous section, there has been significant research on understanding various elements of regional adaption and adaptability. Since the global financial crisis in 2007 -2008 and Great Recession which followed, the concept of regional resilience has been increasingly used in academic research to understand uneven development, particularly in relation to economic change. The focus on resilience reflects an increased interest in understanding the properties or attributes of regional economies as a basis for understand their varied capacity to resist and/or recover from economic change. Adaption is predominantly concerned with understanding the process of change, with resilience more closely concerned with understanding the way in which existing and emerging properties combine.         Increased usage of the term regional resilience has not, however, brought clarity in definition or unified measurement of the concept. Regional resilience has been predominantly defined in two different ways by researchers – using either equilibrist definitions, such as ‘engineering resilience’ (the ability to return to the same state), or ‘ecological resilience’ (the ability to form a new state); or adopting evolutionary perspectives, which explicitly reject equilibrist definitions and assert that regions are in state of constant change. The nature of these different understandings is considered in the following sub-sections. This discussion provides the basis for development of the analytical framework which is established in Section 2.4 in order to investigate regional resilience in policy.    2.2.2.1 Equilibrist understandings of regional resilience  Equilibrist definitions of Regional Resilience stem from characterisations of an economy in that is in a stable state, or which has a tendency towards a return to a stable state. There are two forms ways of characterising equilibrist understandings of resilience. Firstly, ‘engineering resilience’ understands resilience as the ability of a regional economy to resist change, with an assumption that this is a desirable outcome. This approach is perhaps restrictive in application if the understanding of resilience is concerned merely with calculation of the extent to which a region has returned to a previous state. However, this approach does provide a research framework within which to understand the impact of single economic events / plant closures (Simmie & Martin, 2010).  Secondly, the idea of ‘ecological resilience’ shares the equilibrist tendency but allows for the possibility that a region may establish a new development trajectory (similar to a pre-  15  shock state). In this context, a region may establish patterns of economic growth which are stronger / weaker, more precarious / less precarious than prior to an economic shock. Such judgements translate into greater / lesser degrees of economic resilience based on an assessment of the regional economy to resist economic shocks is assessed (for example, (Hill et al., 2011 and Martin, 2012). A growing number of authors (for example, Boschma, 2011, Bristow, 2011, Martin and Sunley, 2013, and Dawley et al, 2010) identify a common issue with both of these equilibrist definitions is that they each have a tendency toward a relatively static notion of local and regional development. Indeed, whilst equilibrist definitions provide contributions to the discussion, ultimately they are limited in their usefulness because they do not necessarily correspond with the evidence of how regional economies evolve over a longer term and neglect the fact that some change may actually be desirable / necessary for the long-term health of the regional economy.  The concept of engineering resilience implies that it is desirable for resilient economies to exhibit a low level of change to established development paths over time, or rather to exhibit high degrees of adaptation in the face of change. This contrasts with the perceived benefit of evolution in successful regional economies (Pike et al., 2006). The idea of ecological resilience privileges a rather less static understanding of regional economies. Nevertheless, the idea of a return to equilibrium remains a central feature, with the role of periodic economic shocks, socio-economic trends, and technological change resulting in a state of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ (Simmie & Martin, 2010, p. 4).    Despite criticisms of equilibrist definitions of regional resilience, it is notable that, where the concept of regional resilience has been applied in research, it has most typically been to operationalise equilibrist definitions of resilience. Through a range of studies resilience has been used as a framework to measure relative degrees of resilience, comparing regional performance (for example, Crescenzi et al., 2016; Cuadrado-Roura, et al., 2016; Doran & Fingleton, 2016; Sensier et al., 2016). Such studies have examined the extent to which regional economies resisted negative economic impacts or were able to adapt to particular economic shocks, to assess the extent to which they recovered compared to a pre-shock baseline. These studies are focussed almost exclusively on outcomes, seeking to quantify the influence of a wide range of indicators including aspects such as: sector-specific factors including input-output relationships and labour market linkages between sectors; export levels; and various aspects of human capital.  The application of these methodologies and selection of output-based (employment and economic output) metrics to determine comparative levels of regional resilience, reveal   16  the focus of equilibrist definitions on systems-based measurement. Structural properties are revealed as privileged concerns in such approaches, with assessment of economic and labour market production assets and their influence on the ability of a region to resist / adapt to negative effects of economic change and return to previous development trajectories (Hill et al., 2011; Martin, 2012).  Simmie & Martin (2010) also stress the role of cycles of adaption within ecological systems. Bristow and Healey (2014), however, note that much less research has focussed on understanding the role of human agency in the process of adaptation, they maintain that this should be a central concern if the concept of regional economic resilience is to add to the range of concepts and approaches used in regional policy and research. In this respect the authors assert that it is important to understand the decisions, behaviour and actions of various agents involved in the process of adaption to develop a fuller understanding of the issue of regional resilience. These aspects are discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.  2.2.2.2 Evolutionary understandings of regional resilience This section focusses on different strands of the evolutionary perspective in order to distinguish their specific features and identify what the implications for what this means in policy and practice. The key elements from this discussion are used in the analytical framework contained in section 2.4.    In response to many of the criticisms of equilibrist approaches to regional resilience, a growing consensus developed around the idea that the concept of regional resilience is more usefully understood within an evolutionary context, rejecting equilibrist assertions, and stressing that regional economies are in a constant state of change (including Bristow & Healey 2014, Boschma, 2011, Bristow, 2011, Martin and Sunley, 2013, Pike et al, 2015, Storper, 2013). Understanding Regional Resilience as part of a wider process of evolutionary change does not necessarily reject all elements of equilibrist approaches, however, indeed Martin (2012) notes the possibility that regional resilience analyses may consider recovery from specific shocks and/or the degree to which regions were able to resist shocks, but also the extent to which emergent changes in regional economic structure are evident.  As a way of reflecting this process of change and adaption, Simmie and Martin (2010) identify four dimensions which should be considered within the process of understanding regional resilience:  ■ resistance, the degree of sensitivity or depth of reaction to an economic shock;  ■ recovery: the speed and degree of recovery from a recessionary shock;    17  ■ reorientation, the extent of reorientation and adaption in response to recessionary shock; and,  ■ renewal, the extent to which the regional economy renews its pre-recession growth path or hysteretic shift to a new path.  Building on this idea of a dynamic process to understand resilience, Martin & Sunley (2013) illustrate how the concept of Regional Resilience can be understood within sector development cycles. They note that regional economic growth can be a function of life cycles of industries and technologies located therein – with industries and/or technologies going through a process of emergence, youth, growth and maturity, with the hypothesis that as firms or sectors mature they become less flexible or dynamic when faced with economic change – resulting in reduced resilience at firm and aggregate sector / regional level. At a regional level, the competitive position of regional sectors within global value chains is therefore a key determinant of the impact of economic change on the region –as it can determine their degree to which they are vulnerable or can take advantage of economic change (and their ability to plan/react to it).  Furthermore, several researchers have identified the issue that within this process of adaption dominant successful firms in regions often act to increase or reduce the degree of regional adaptability which may be necessary to increase resilience through innovative practice and/or diversification of the business base (Frenken et al., 2007 & Hill, et al., 2011). This highlights a wider issue which relates to the fact that understanding what shapes actions and influences that facilitate adaption and/or stimulate adaptive capacity arguably provides improved insight to understand how and why approaches to regional resilience are taken, moving beyond measurement and comparison of degrees of stability. This is the aspect of regional resilience which this thesis seeks to engage with, as such an evolutionary understanding of regional resilience is therefore perhaps most useful to as it seeks to understand the constant process and inter-play between adaptation and adaptability, with resilience determined by the ability of the region to develop and maintain adaptive capacity.  Where evolutionary definitions have been used in academic research this has typically been through approaches which have explored the process of adaption and the significance of previous development patterns as a source of adaptive capacity. This has taken Schumpeterian ideas of tec
