Contrary to most scholars in Taiwan, this Thesis argues that 1) pure economic loss should be a recognizable harm under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184; and 2) economic loss should be considered on a category-by-category basis, rather than the traditional all-or-none basis presently used in Taiwan. Traditionally, two arguments are made against recovery for pure economic loss in Taiwan. First, it creates an unnecessary conflict between tort law and contract law. Second, it potentially creates indeterminate liability for the defendant. Based on practices with pure economic loss in foreign jurisdictions (particularly the United States), however, both concerns can accommodated. This Thesis argues that Taiwan should adopt, by statute, a category-by-category approach for recovery for economic harm as the best way to protect rights of innocent victims without risking indeterminate liability for defendants.    vi Table of Contents  Introduction .......................................................................................................................... 1 Chapter One: The Problem of Pure Economic Loss 1.1 The Origin and the Importance of Recovery for Pure Economic Loss ........................ 6  1.2 Constitutional Obligations for the Legislature to Stipulate Clear Rules Regulating Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Unintentional Torts ................................................ 9  A.

In response, this Thesis argues that pure economic loss should be recognized as harm under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184 and also suggests a proper standard for recovery. Generally, pure economic loss refers to pecuniary loss that does not flow from physical harm to a victim’s person or property.1 For example, assume a company hires a public accountant to do auditing works and to issue financial reports to satisfy potential buyers of its solid financial status. The financial statements are negligently made and fail to disclose the company’s insolvency. Relying on the report, a potential buyer invests in the company and later suffers a loss when, soon after, the company files for bankruptcy.2 The lost profit by the potential buyer is an example of pure economic loss. Recovery for pure economic loss is an open issue in Taiwan. Courts and scholars are divided.3 Moreover, even if we defer to Taiwanese Supreme Court’s decisions to grant such recovery,4 the standard for recovery is open to debate.  1 For more details on common law definition of pure economic loss, see Indianapolis-Marion Cnty. Pub. Library v. Charlier Clark & Linard, P.C., 929 N.E.2d 722 (Ind. 2010); Harris v. Suniga, 149 P.3d 224 (Or. App. 2006); and RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW THIRD TORTS: LIABILITY FOR ECONOMIC HARM §2 (Tentative Draft No.1, 2012). 2 For similar cases, please refer to Ultramares v. Touche, 174 N.E 441 (N.Y. 1931); Bily v. Arthur Young & Co., 834 P.2d 745 (1992); Grant Thornton LLP v. Prospect High Income Fund, 314 S.W.3d 913 (Tex. 2010); Nycal Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP., 668 N.E.2d 1368 (1998); and First Nat’l Bank v. Crawford, 386 S.E.2d 310 (1989). 3 Although Supreme Court of Taiwan implied that pure economic loss could be recoverable under negligence according to the former part of first paragraph of Article 184 in Civil Code of Taiwan, Professor Tzechien Wang, an outstanding scholar in the field of the Civil Code of Taiwan, argued against such interpretation. See Zuigao Fayuan, 77 Nian 19 Tze Minschi Di Er Chuehyi (Supreme Court of Taiwan, The  1                                                         To solve the issue, looking at American common law on recovery for economic harm is helpful.5 Under the American common law, pure economic loss generally is not recoverable unless accompanied by physical harm to the victims;6 however, it is recoverable where professionals such as accountants or attorneys negligently issue opinions and others rely, to their detriment, on their work.7 In all, three approaches are used. First, some cases use the usual foreseeability test in tort law.8 Second, others require privity between the professionals and the third parties.9 Finally, others rely on § 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts and limit the professional’s liability to intended third parties.10  Because of the current ambiguity in Taiwan about recovery for pure economic loss, this Thesis proposes the adoption of a statute to clarify the standard and to protect individual rights. In turn, the main focus of this Thesis will be which is these three common law standards for recovery of pure economic loss best conforms to the policy concerns and the spirit of Civil Code of Taiwan.11  Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention, Nov. 01, 1988) CHUEHYI HUIBIAN vol. 1, 1040 (2001) and Wang Tzechien, Chin Chuan Hsing Wei Fa (Tort Law) 375-426 Taipei: San Min Book Co., Ltd., 2011. 4 Supreme Court of Taiwan once held a defendant liable for a shop owner’s lost profits resulting from the defendant’s negligent infliction of the shop’s electrical cables during construction works. Zuigao Fayuan, 91 Nian Tai Shang Zi No. 2096. (Tai Shang Zi No. 2096 by Supreme Court of Taiwan, Mar. 17, 2002). 5 Although Professor Tzechien Wang claimed that pure economic loss is hardly a question in the American common law, research into this topic may suggest otherwise. See supra footnote 3 for Prof. Wang’s book at 390. 6 See RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS: PRODUCTS LIABILITY §21 (1998). 7 See supra note 2. 8 H. Rosenblum, Inc. v. Adler, 93 N.J. 324 (1983). 9 Ultramares v. Touche, 174 N.E 441 (N.Y. 1931). 10 Nycal Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 668 N.E.2d 1368 (1998) (Supreme Court of Massachusetts applied RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 552 (1977)). 11 Readers may also find a liability for accountant malpractice in Article 20 in Securities and Exchange Act of Taiwan. However, this Thesis will not discuss the liability in Securities and Exchange Act because of its purpose of proposing a general standard for recovery for pure economic loss in several other civil cases. For English version of this rule, see the website below:   http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=G0400001.  2                                                                                                                                                                      This Thesis focuses on a comparative review of Taiwanese tort law and the American common law for option on how best to implement the spirit of Civil Code of Taiwan.12 First, this Thesis analyzes Article 184,13 Article 213,14 and Article 21615 in Civil Code of Taiwan, along with judicial opinions, law review articles, and other secondary authorities to survey the present status of recovery for pure economic loss in Taiwan and why it’s insufficient. Second, this Thesis compares the law on recovery for economic loss in Taiwan with the American common law. In part, this is done because the pure economic loss rule has a deeper and more comprehensive history in the American common law. Third, this Thesis will use Economic Analysis of Law to study and justify both the imposition of duties on professionals and the limits of that liability.16 Finally, this Thesis will determine which of the three American approaches for pure economic loss in professional malpractice is the best for Taiwan. Chapter One first reviews the current treatment of pure economic loss under Article 184 of the Civil Code of Taiwan. Chapter One then will briefly address the need for legislation to stipulate a clear rule to protect individual rights. Finally, Chapter One also illustrates how recovery for pure economic loss matters in daily business matters and why providing clear standards here serve the general public. Chapter Two briefly introduces the tort law of Taiwan. Since Taiwan is a Civil Law country, this chapter focuses on several general statutes — including Article 184, Article 12 For more comparisons on pure economic loss rule in countries in addition to the United States, please refer to Vernon V. Palmer & Mauro Bussani, PURE ECONOMIC LOSS: NEW HORIZONS IN COMPARATIVE LAW (2009). 13 It is a rule about tort cause of action in Civil Code of Taiwan.  14 It is a rule about methods of compensation in Civil Code of Taiwan.  15 It is a rule about coverage of recovery in Civil Code of Taiwan.  16 Economic Analysis of Law is generally applied to tort law to define duty. See United States v. Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169 (2d Cir. 1947) for Judge Hand’s famous Hand Formula, B<PL test.  3                                                         213, and Article 216 in the Civil Code of Taiwan17 — to consider recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional torts. This Chapter also considers the Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention in which Taiwanese Supreme Court addressed the relationship between Taiwanese contract law and Taiwanese tort law.18 Finally, this Chapter considers whether the Court’s decision and the Civil Code of Taiwan is adequate for pure economic loss. Chapter Three gives an overview of American common law Torts. This Chapter first describes the structure of American tort law, along with how recovery for pure economic loss has been treated in different areas. This includes unintentional torts (including products liability), public nuisance,19 and negligent malpractice. Finally, this Chapter considers various policy arguments of recovery for pure economic loss under professional malpractice, as well as three different standards for recovery.20  Chapter Four is heart of the Thesis. First, the Chapter identifies several possible approaches to recovery for pure economic loss. Second, it uses Economic Analysis of Law to provide justification for imposing a duty to prevent pure economic loss of another as well as limits on the scope of liability.21 Third, it suggests policy arguments for imposing a duty to prevent economic harm on professionals, thereby making it a Tort. Fourth, after comparing the Civil Code of Taiwan and American Tort law, it argues for the adoption of the common law pure economic loss rule by Taiwan. Fifth, it argues, based 17 See supra note 13-15. 18 Zuigao Fayuan, 77 Nian 19 Tze Minschi Di Er Chuehyi (Supreme Court of Taiwan, The Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention, Nov. 01, 1988) CHUEHYI HUIBIAN vol. 1, 1040 (2001). 19 Generally, all offenses one suffers in public nuisance involve an interference with the interests of the community at large- interests that were recognized as rights of the general public entitled to protection.

Finally, after proposing a tentative rule, this Chapter will illustrate how the new proposed rule will apply, using hypotheticals from real cases. Chapter Five then summarizes how Taiwanese courts should treat pure economic loss before and after the proposed legislation.    5 Chapter One The Problem of Pure Economic Loss  1.1 The Origin and Importance of Recovery for Pure Economic Loss Pure economic loss refers to pecuniary loss that does not flow from physical harm to a victim’s person or property.22 Although no issues on recovery for pure economic loss arise in intentional tort because scienter of the tortfeasor satisfies the requirement of foreseeability of harm to particular victims, recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort is more controversial.23 Professor Tzechien Wang, an outstanding scholar in the field of the Civil Code of Taiwan, argues that pure economic loss is not recoverable in unintentional tort. He relies upon the first paragraph of Article 184 in the Civil Code, the tort cause of action in Taiwan, provides as follows: A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom; the same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals.24  Professor Wang notes the former part of the rule protects one’s individual rights from harm and the latter part of the rule protects one’s interests.25 As pure economic loss is the harm to interests rather than individual rights, he argues that pure economic loss is not recoverable harm under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184.26 In addition, he argues that pure economic loss can be recovered in contract law and that since contract 22 See supra note 1. 23 The Thesis uses unintentional tort to distinguish it from intentional tort in order to include the discussion on recovery for pure economic loss in strict products liability. The term “negligence” may not effectively serve this task.  24 CIVIL CODE (Taiwan), http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=B0000001. 25 Wang Tzechien, Min Fa Shiue Shuo Yu Pan Li Yan Jiou Di Ba Tse (Research of Civil Law Theory and Cases, Volume Eight) 246. Taipei: San Min Book Co., Ltd., 2009. 26 Id.  6                                                         law provides a more efficient way to protect economic interests, recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort is unnecessary.27 Taiwanese courts are divided on the issue. While some court opinions follow Professor Wang’s approach,28 the majority interprets “rights” to include recovery for pure economic loss.29  The issue of recovery for pure economic loss is a challenging topic because of a conflict between two strong and separate policy concerns — protecting innocent victims and preventing indeterminate liability.30 Although it is natural for victims to claim damages when harmed, it also is difficult to ignore concerns about indeterminate liability, especially when the plaintiff recovers for such intangible harm.31 As Justice Cardozo suggested in Ultramares v. Touche, “if liability for negligence exists [in recovery for pure economic loss], a thoughtless slip or blunder may expose the defendant to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.”32 As a matter of fact, indeterminate Tort liability harms society because the interests and risks of taking certain actions will be difficult to predict.33  While Professor Wang’s argument against recovery for pure economic loss is based on his interpretation of “interests” under Article 184, it’s also possible to recognize economic loss under the “rights” language of Article 184. For example, pure economic 27 Id. at 300-01. 28 Taipei Ti Fang Fa Yuan 93 Nian Lao Su Zi No. 106 (Lao Su Zi No. 106 by Taiwan Taipei District Court, Sept. 14, 2004). 29 Zuigao Fayuan, 91 Nian Tai Shang Zi No. 2096 (Tai Shang Zi No. 2096 by Supreme Court of Taiwan, Mar. 17, 2002); Zuigao Fayuan, 88 Nian Tai Shang Zi No. 1827 (Tai Shang Zi No. 1827 by Supreme Court of Taiwan, Aug. 13, 1999); Taichung Ti Fang Fa Yuan 93 Nian Su Zi No. 951 (Su Zi NO. 951 by Taiwan Taichung District Court, Mar. 30, 2005); and Zuigao Fayuan, 77 Nian 19 Tze Minschi Di Er Chuehyi (Supreme Court of Taiwan, The Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention, Nov. 01, 1988) CHUEHYI HUIBIAN vol. 1, 1040 (2001). 30 See supra note 3 for Prof. Wang’s book at 377-78. 31 Id. 32 See supra note 2 for Ultramares v. Touche at 444. 33 This argument derives from the application of Economic Analysis of Law. Please see Infra chapter four for analysis.  7                                                         loss is recoverable, in limited cases, in the American common law where a professional negligently performs services knowing a limited group of parties intend to rely on his work and do to their detriment.34 Also, Professor Wang argues that contract law provides a more efficient forum for pure economic loss. Indeed, if parties are in privity of contract, indeterminate liability in tort may devour the law of contract.35 However, if a plaintiff not in privity suffers pure economic loss, such as the negligent misrepresentation case mentioned earlier, imposing a tort liability may a better alternative.36  Thus, under the current approach, a victim’s recovery for pure economic loss is considered on an all-or-nothing basis under Article 184. If the court declines to allow recovery for pure economic loss, the result may be unfair and unjust to the victims since the magnitude of economic harm to them may sometimes be too large to absorb.37 The goal of this Thesis, therefore, is to provide an interpretation that both protects innocent victims and avoids unlimited liability in tort. Three claims will be proposed:  1) Not allowing recovery for pure economic harm under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184 in Civil Code of Taiwan unfairly limits recovery for innocent victims;  2) Recovery for pure economic loss, properly understood, is about policy concerns about coverage of recovery rather than whether pure economic loss is harm to individual rights or interests; and  3) A proper standard for recovery for pure economic loss should be established under a category-by-category basis to properly balance concerns over indeterminate liability with protection of innocent victims. 34 See supra note 2 for Nycal. 35 Grant Gilmore, THE DEATH OF CONTRACT 87-94 (1974). 36 The accountant’s liability for negligent misrepresentation in Securities and Exchange Act is also a tort liability to third parties. See supra note 11. 37 In arguing against recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort, Professor Wang takes pure economic loss suffered through the interruption of electricity for example and suggests that such harm is usually minor. See Wang Tzechien, Min Fa Shiue Shuo Yu Pan Li Yan Jiou Di Ba Tse (Research of Civil Law Theory and Cases, Volume Eight) 296 Taipei: San Min Book Co., Ltd., 2009.   8                                                         1.2 Constitutional Obligations for the Legislature to Stipulate Clear Rules Regulating Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Unintentional Torts It is natural for an injured person to claim recovery, whether that injury is physical harm or intangible harm.38 Pure economic loss is intangible harm, a kind of pecuniary loss which does not flow from one’s person or property.39 Although this Thesis argues for the recovery for pure economic loss, it does not argue for recovery in every unintentional tort case. The core issues, instead, are what the standard for recovery should be and how that standard best protects individual rights.40 Here, two relevant constitutional claims help frame and clarify why the legislature should clarify the standard for recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort. A. The Requirement of Protecting Individual Rights — The Right of Property Defined According to Article 15 in the Constitution of the Republic of China,41 the right of existence, the right of work, and the right of property shall be guaranteed to the people. Since the right of property is the basis of social and economic development of a country, the government needs not only to refrain from interfering with the right but also to establish a legal system to protect it.42 According to SHIZI No. 400,43 the guarantee of right of property under Article 15 in Constitution of the Republic of China is to guarantee 38 See supra 7. 39 See supra note 1. 40 A clear and well-developed legal system helps protect individual rights, and a government has a duty to stipulate required legislations. See Lee Huitsung, Xianfa Yao Yi (Essentials of Constitution) 253-78, 279-94 Taipei: Angle Publishing Co., Ltd., 2006. 41 MINGUO XIANFA art. 15 (1947) (Taiwan). 42 See supra note 40 at 254-55. 43 Grand justices make up a committee and enjoy the unique authority of interpreting the Constitution of the Republic of China. After they decide a case, they issue a SHIZI with a series of number coming after the name. Therefore, SHIZI is the most authoritative document for research on Constitution of the Republic of China. See Article 5 in the ADDITIONAL ARTICLES of the CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA.  9                                                         an individual the right to use his property, to profit from it, and to dispose of it freely. This function allows the individual to claim the removal of the interference to his right of property.44 With the development of society, however, a claim of obligation is also included in the right of property.45 Thus, the right of property should include every right the law intends to give a person, including the right to enjoy the economic value of property.46 This would include the right to claim pure economic loss.47 In addition, the limitation on right of property should be done in accordance with Article 23 in Constitution of the Republic of China, which limits restrictions on property to those necessary to protect the rights of others.48  B. The Requirement of Clearly-defined Legal System — To Protect Individual Rights The Constitution also requires a clearly defined legal system. According to Article 16,49 the people shall have the right to present petitions, lodge complaints, or institute legal proceedings. The right to institute legal proceedings, as right of property does, requires the government to establish law to carry out that protection.50 Such rights originate from the basic premise that where there is a right, there is a remedy.51 Thus, the government has a duty to establish fair litigating proceedings.52 As was stated by grand 44 See also Article 767 in CIVIL CODE of Taiwan. 45 See SHIZI No. 106 and SHIZI No. 292. 46 See supra note 40 at 257 and SHIZI No. 451. 47 How the standard for recovery for pure economic loss should be is a question of law and is the core issue of the Thesis. 48 All the freedoms and rights enumerated in the preceding Articles shall not be restricted by law except by such as may be necessary to prevent infringement upon the freedoms of other persons, to avert an imminent crisis, to maintain social order or to advance public welfare.

Thus, to implement a remedy for every right, the government should establish a well-developed legal system to help people recover damages when there is harm to individual rights and to help people exercise their rights when there is interference.53 Finally, similar to the limitation on right of property, the restriction on rights to institute litigations should also conform to Article 23 in Constitution and is subject to proportionality.54 1.3 Categories and Illustrations of Economic Harm: Solving the Issue of Pure Economic Loss Serves the Interests of the General Public For laypeople, economic harm happens every day. For example, assume a person is hit by a motor vehicle, taken to a hospital, and then received a bill for medical expenses. The economic harm here suffered here came from injury to his person, for example, if his arms or his legs were broken. As another example, assume a person crashed his friend’s laptop. Here, the friend also suffered economic harm from injury to his property. In both cases, the economic harm victims suffered by the victims is physical harm to their person or property, not pure economic loss.55  In contrast, pure economic loss is pecuniary loss which does not flow from physical harm to person or to property.56 A few illustrations can illustrate what “pure” economic harm is.  53 See supra note 40 at 281-83. 54 The Principle of Proportionality requires that the method and the purpose should fit. See supra note 40 at 111 and SHIZI No. 507. 55 See supra note 1. 56 Id.  11                                                         A. Harm to Product Itself: Economic Harm in Products Liability A buyer brings a tort claim for recovery for loss of use suffered and personal injuries caused by the defendant’s negligent design of a vehicle.57 The loss of use is usually called harm to property itself, and is recognized as pure economic loss. B. Economic Harm in Public Nuisance58 Because of the constructor’s negligence, an underground railway collapses and a shop nearby must shutdown down for several weeks. The owner of the shop brings a tort claim for recovery for lost income during the shut down.59 In another case, a business owner is trapped at the scene of a car accident and, as a result, fails to meet a contract and loses millions of dollars. Both cases illustrate pure economic loss. 57 See also East River Steamship Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 106 S. Ct. 2295 (1986). 58 See supra note 19. 59 See also 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc., 96 N.Y.2d 280 (2001).  12                                                         C. Economic Harm in Negligent Misrepresentation Company A hires B, an accountant, to do audit works and issue financial reports for Company A. When agreeing to do the works, the accountant knows the report will be disseminated to potential buyers of the company. However, B negligently made the auditing reports and fails to disclose Company A’s insolvency in the reports. A relying third party then invests in Company A and lost profits in his investment.60 The harm to the third party is pure economic loss. D. Economic Harm in Negligent Performance of Service An attorney negligently drafts a will, causing a beneficiary to lose a gift of $50,000.61 Since the beneficiary does not become the owner of the property because of the error, the harm suffered by the beneficiary is not physical harm to properties but pure economic loss.   60 See also Grant Thornton LLP v.

Overview:  This chapter summarizes Taiwanese tort law. Taiwan inherits Civil Law system from Germany and thus has statutes governing all civil liabilities.62 For Torts, these include the tort cause of action,63 methods of recovery,64 and coverage of recovery.65 In addition, since pure economic loss, at times, involves conflicts between contract law and tort law,66 this chapter also covers Taiwanese court opinions about that relationship. B. Taiwanese Tort Law — What a Plaintiff Needs to Prove Article 184 of the Civil Code of Taiwan establishes the basis of tort cause of action. It provides that:  A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals.  A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted for the protection of others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved. 62 See supra note 24. 63 Article 184 in CIVIL CODE (Taiwan). 64 Article 213 in CIVIL CODE (Taiwan). 65 Article 216 in CIVIL CODE (Taiwan). 66 For example, pure economic loss is generally not recoverable in strict products liability because harm to product itself should be the question for contract law or warranty law. See supra note 6 and note 57.  14                                                         Under this provision, therefore, a plaintiff who brings a tort action must prove seven elements.67 1) Defendant’s Acts: Society values liberty and individualism. Thus, no one could be held liable for the actions of another person.68 Therefore, the plaintiff’s injury must be caused by the defendant’s acts. This includes situations where the defendant aggressively hurts the plaintiff; where the defendant uses another person to achieve his goal of hurting the plaintiff; and where the plaintiff is under a duty to act but fails to do so, harming the plaintiff. 2) Defendant’s Acts Are Tortious Whether the defendant’s acts are tortious depends on whether there are affirmative defenses such as self-defense or plaintiff’s consent. For example, in self-defense, the defendant hurt the plaintiff because the plaintiff hurt him first. Under such circumstances, the defendant’s act was not tortious because it was self-defense. 67 The following text about requirements of tort law of Taiwan is cited and modified from Liu Cheuntang, Pan Jie Min Fa Jai Bian Tung Tze (Case Analysis on General Prov. of Obligation of the Civil Code) Taipei: San Min Book Co., Ltd., 2001, 76-83. Please refer to it for more details. 68 An exception to individualism in tort law is vicarious liability, the responsibility of the superior for the acts of their subordinate. For example, an employer shall be jointly liable for his employee’s negligence according to Article 188 in the Civil Code of Taiwan.  15                                                         3) Defendant’s Acts Hurt Plaintiff’s Rights or Interests Article 184 protects everyone against three categories of Torts. The first is harm to individual rights. Under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184, every person who suffers recognizable injuries can bring suit in Tort, whether as an intentional tort or negligence.69 The second is intentional harms because of a violation of the “rules of morals.” For example, the plaintiff has a tort action when his opportunity to make a deal or contract with others was intentionally harmed by the defendant. The final category is harm through statutory violation where the statute intends to protect people, such the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act.70  4) Damage The goal of civil liability is to deter harm and provide compensation for actual loss. If no one is harmed by the defendant’s acts, there should be no recovery. The type of harm includes personal injuries, property damages, and harms not recognized in former part of first paragraph of Article 184. 5) Damage Was Proximately Caused by Defendant’s Acts Taiwan tort law also uses proximate cause. Therefore, the defendant’s acts not only must pass the “but for” test (i.e., that if X had not occurred, Y would not have happened) or “substantial factor” test (i.e., where each of several defendants was a 69 This Thesis argues, however, that harm to economic interests is also a recognizable harm under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184 in Civil Code of Taiwan. 70 For English version of this act, see:  http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=K0040012.  16                                                         substantial factor in causing injury)71 but also the foreseeability test (i.e., whether the defendant’s acts usually cause the same kind of harm to the plaintiff). 6) Defendant Was Intentional or Negligent Whether a tort is intentional or negligent is based on the defendant’s state of mind. It’s a core issue and also the most difficult one for the plaintiff to prove. The defendant acts “intentionally” when he knowingly and intentionally causes an injury. The act also is intentional if he knows the act will result in the elements of the offense and if the act is not against his will.72 As for negligence, an act is negligently if the defendant fails to exercise the duty of care he should have in the circumstances.73  7)  Defendant Had the Legal Capacity When He Hurt Others:  Article 187 also requires the defendant must be legally competent at the time he commits the Tort: A person of no capacity or limited in capacity to make juridical acts, who has wrongfully damaged the rights of another, shall be jointly liable with his guardian for any injury arising therefrom if he is capable of discernment at the time of committing such an act. If he is incapable of discernment at the time of committing the act, his guardian alone shall be liable for such injury. 71 The substantial factor test was developed to address a situation in which there were two or more causes of the harm to plaintiff and either of the causes alone would have been sufficient to bring about the harm. In this situation, because a strict application of the cause-in-fact “but-for” test “would allow both tortfeasors to avoid liability, courts made the policy decision to nevertheless impose liability ‘if [the defendant's conduct] was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing [the event] about.’ ” Gerst v. Marshall, 549 N.W.2d 810, 815 (1996). 72 For full text defining intentional harm, see Article 13 in the CRIMINAL CODE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA. Full English version may be found at this website: http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=C0000001. 73 For full text defining negligent harm, see Article 14 in the CRIMINAL CODE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA at http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=C0000001.  17                                                         Thus, whether one has the capacity to make juridical acts depends on whether the defendant is capable of discernment at the time he acts. 2.2 Rules about Methods and Coverage of Recovery — Articles 213 and 216 — No Present Rules for Recovery for Pure Economic Loss74  In addition to discussing whether recovery for pure economic loss is a recognizable right under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184, an overview of the methods and coverage of recovery also helps frame whether pure economic loss is recoverable in unintentional tort in Taiwan. A. Methods of Recovery In Taiwan, the primary goal of compensation is to restore the status quo before the harm to an injured party. Article 213 in Civil Code provides that: Unless otherwise provided by the act or by the contract, a person who is bound to make compensation for an injury shall restore the injured party to the status quo before the injury. If the restoration of the status quo ante shall be paid in money, interest shall be added from the time of the injury. Under the circumstances of the first paragraph, the creditor may claim the necessary expenses for restoration instead of the restoration. Therefore, damages other than restoring the victim to the status quo are possible only when the law or the contract provides otherwise.75 For tort actions, four methods of 74 The following context about method and coverage of recovery is also modified from Prof. Liu’s book. See supra note 67 at 152-153, at 119-23, and at 155-56. 75 Id. at 152.  18                                                         recovery are available. None, however, explicitly refer to recovery for pure economic loss in tort.76  1) Harm to Body or Health  With regard to harm to another’s body or health, Article 193 provides that: If a person has wrongfully damaged to the body or health of another, and caused the injured person to lose or decrease his laboring capacity, or to increase the need in living, the tortfeasors shall be bound to make compensation to the injured person for any injury arising therefrom. The court may, on the application of the parties, order the compensation of the preceding paragraph to be made in periodical payments of money, but the court shall compel the tortfeasor to furnish security. 2) Harm to Personality Damages can be recovered for harm to personality, such as reputation, credit, or privacy. Here, the victim can recover even if the injury is not a pecuniary loss. The first paragraph of Article 195 provides that: If a person has wrongfully damaged to the body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy or chastity of another, or to another’s personality in a severe way, the injured person may claim a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss.  If it was reputation that has been damaged, the injured person may also claim the taking of proper measures for the rehabilitation of his reputation. However, since personality may not be transferred or inherited, neither can claims for harm arising from it.77 Thus, under the second paragraph of Article 195, the claim in the 76 Id. at 119-23. 77 Id. at 122.  19                                                         first paragraph may not be transferred or inherited unless the claim has been promised by contract or has been commenced.78 3) Harm to Status Based on the Relationship to Close Relatives Consortium claims also are covered under the third paragraph of Article 195. It provides that the provisions of the first two paragraphs shall be mutatis mutandis applied when a person has been damaged in a severe way based on their relationship to their father, mother, sons, daughters, or spouse.79  4) Harm to Property Harm to property is covered under Article 196. Here, an injured person may claim compensation for the diminution of the value of their property causes by a tortfeasor.80 This is a key issue for debate about recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort. Most legal scholars in Taiwan argue that diminution of the value of a property is not recoverable in unintentional tort.81 This Thesis considers this issue in depth in Chapter Four. B. Coverage of Recovery Under Taiwanese law, a default rule of coverage of recovery is provided, unless otherwise changed by contract. The language of Article 216 states that: 78 See Article 195 in CIVIL CODE of Taiwan. 79 See also BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 1177 (10th ed. 2014) for “mutatis mutandis”. 80 See Article 196 in CIVIL CODE of Taiwan. 81 See supra note 37 for Prof. Wang’s book at 273.   20                                                         Unless otherwise provided by the act or by the contract, the compensation shall be limited to the injury actually suffered and the interests which have been lost. Interests which could have been normally expected are deemed to be the interests which have been lost, according to the ordinary course of things, the decided projects, equipment, or other particular circumstances. This rule adopts the principle of full recovery. The coverage of recovery includes two spheres.82 First, the tortfeasor must compensate the victim for harm to property or interests existing at the time of injury.83 Second, the tortfeasor also must pay for interests the injured should have received but for the tort.84 Furthermore, these expected interests are valued in accordance with the ordinary course of things, the decided projects, equipment, or other particular circumstances.85 2.3 Recovery for Pure Economic Loss When Parties Are in Privity of Contract — An Overview on Supreme Court of Taiwan, The Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention, Nov. 01, 1988 Unlike the common law, which has separate rules for Contracts and Torts, the Civil Code of Taiwan has a single set of rules for both. The relationship between Contract and tort law in the Civil Code, however, is uncertain. As mentioned earlier, a key issue in pure economic loss is the possible conflict between contract law and tort law.86  The issue was considered by the Supreme Court of Taiwan in the Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention of 1988. The case involved an employee who breached his duty and misrepresented the financial status of another. Based on this representation, his employer made a loan and suffered pure economic loss. The employer then sued the 82 See supra note 67 at 155. 83 Id. 84 Id. at 156. 85 See the second paragraph of Article 216 in CIVIL CODE of Taiwan. 86 See supra 14.  21                                                         employee for recovery under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184.87 The decision by the Court implied recovery for pure economic loss is permitted under Article 184 and that pure economic loss is, therefore, recoverable in unintentional tort. 2.4 Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Unintentional Torts: Does A Defendant Have a Duty to General Public to Prevent Pure Economic Loss? While most courts in Taiwan argue against recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort, those same courts also seem to recognize the need to protect innocent victims from harm, even when the damage suffered is pure economic loss. Here, the courts interpret Article 184 to allow recovery for pure economic loss. For example, in Zuigao Fayuan, 91 Nian Tai Shang Zi No. 2096,88 the defendant intentionally shut off the electricity going to the victim’s restaurant. As a result of the power failure, the victim had to shut down his restaurant. Here, the court found the defendant harmed the victim’s right to operate the restaurant and allowed recovery for lost profits under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184. In so holding, the court allowed recovery for pure economic loss in an unintentional tort case. In another case, a defendant famous for appraisal of expensive watches (such as Rolex) conspired with other defendants to cheat the plaintiffs by falsely certifying a fake watch as genuine.89 The plaintiff sued for recovery for pure economic loss because after buying five fake Rolex watches based on the defendant’s appraisal. The court reasoned recovery for pure economic loss is a recognizable right under the former part of first paragraph of Article 184, thereby making pure economic loss recoverable in unintentional tort. 87 See supra note 3 for the Second Decision of 19th Civil Case Convention made by Supreme Court of Taiwan. 88 Tai Shang Zi No. 2096 by Supreme Court of Taiwan, Mar. 17, 2002. 89 Su Zi No. 951 by Taiwan Taichung District Court, Mar. 30, 2005.  22                                                         2.5 Summary: The Uncertain State of Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Taiwan Thus, the current state of law in Taiwan is uncertain. The current rules either fail to clarify whether recovery for pure economic loss is recoverable under Article 184 or fail to stipulate whether pure economic loss is included within coverage of recovery. Although courts usually find recovery for pure economic loss is allowed under Article 184,90 they fail to provide a clear standard. As such, recovery for pure economic loss is an all-or-nothing result. Either it applies to no cases for unintentional torts or, if it does, it applies to all kinds of unintentional tort cases. In Chapter Four, this Thesis will explain, in greater detail, the shortcoming of the current rules in Taiwan about recovery for pure economic loss.   90 See supra note 87-89.  23                                                         Chapter Three Tort Law & Pure Economic Loss Rule in the American Common Law 3.1 The General Concept of Negligence in the American Common Law A. Overview The goal of this Chapter is two-fold. First, it summarizes the common law of negligence. This helps provide a comparison between tort law in Taiwan and the United States. Second, pure economic loss rule is comprehensively discussed in American law.91 This Chapter surveys several approaches to recovery for pure economic loss used by American courts. Together, both can used in order to shed light on possible solutions for Taiwanese legal scholarship. B. What Does a Plaintiff Need to Prove in Negligence? 1) Duty: Standard of Care To prove a negligence case, American tort law requires a plaintiff to prove breach of duty, casual connection, and damages.92 The first issue here is what the standard of care means. Generally, a person must act as an ordinarily careful person or a reasonably prudent person under similar circumstances.93 As stated by William Prosser: In negligence cases, the duty is always the same, to conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in light of the apparent risk. What the 91 See supra note 5. 92 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS §433B(1) (1965). 93 Jones v. Chicago HMO Ltd. of Illinois, 191 Ill. 2d 278, 295, (2000).  24                                                         defendant must do, or must not do, is a question of the standard of conduct required to satisfy the duty.94 In a usual case, expert testimony is not required to establish the standard of care. However, where a the defendant is a professional,95 expert testimony is generally necessary to establish the required standard of care owed by the professional unless the alleged negligence is so obviously shown that the trier of fact could recognize it without expert testimony.96 Such expert testimony is necessary to establish the relevant standard for the trier of fact because professional standards are often beyond the knowledge of the average person.97  In addition to the need of expert testimony, locality rule helps delineate the standard of care of a professional. For example, in an accountant malpractice case where the plaintiff suffers pure economic loss, the plaintiff has to establish the standard of care of the accountant. This may include the general expectation that the accountant will render his services with certain degree of skill, care, knowledge, and judgment usually possessed and exercised by members of the profession in the particular locality.98 Thus, in professional malpractice cases, the “locality rule” requires the professional to act with ordinary and reasonable care in accordance with the customs or practices of professionals from a particular geographic region. Such standard can be the same community standard,99 a regional standard100 or a national standard,101 depending on what law the state court applies.102 94 Id. See also W. Prosser, TORTS, 324 (4th ed. 1971). 95 Many cases about recovery for pure economic loss involve professional malpractice. See supra note 2. 96 Schultz v. Bank of Am., N.A., 990 A.2d 1078 (2010). 97 Id. at 1086. 98 Kemmerlin v. Wingate, 261 S.E.2d 50 (1979). 99 Noll v. Rahal, 219 Va. 795, 250 S.E.2d 741 (1979). 100 Shipley v. Williams, 350 S.W.3d 527 (Tenn. 2011).  25                                                         2) Breach of Duty A plaintiff in a negligence action first must establish a duty. Often this is based on the reasonable person standard.103 The test here is what a reasonable person would do or not do under similar circumstances. 3) Causation After duty and breach, the plaintiff also must prove a casual connection between the defendant’s acts and the plaintiff’s injuries — both legal cause and proximate cause. The plaintiff first must prove either the “but for” test (i.e., if the defendant had not been negligent, the plaintiff would not have suffered injuries)104 or the “substantial factor” test (i.e., where each of several defendants was a substantial factor in causing injury).105 The plaintiff next must prove proximate cause, which generally is based on whether the defendant’s injury is reasonably foreseeable or whether the plaintiff is within a zone of danger.106 101 Nwaneri v. Sandidge, 931 A.2d 466 (D.C. 2007). 102 The standard of care applicable to accountants is the same as that applied to doctors and other professional men furnishing skilled services for compensation and that standard requires reasonable care and competence therein. See Gammel v. Ernst & Ernst, 72 N.W.2d 364, 365 (1955). 103 Bethel v. New York City Transit Authority 92 N.Y.2d 348 (1998). 104 “But For” test of negligence is appropriate test for actual causation in majority of circumstances. Vincent by Staton v. Fairbanks Mem'l Hosp., 862 P.2d 847 (Alaska 1993). 105 See supra note 71. 106 Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R. Co. 248 N.Y. 399, 162 N.E. 99 (1928).  26                                                                                                                                                                      4) Damage As mentioned in Chapter Two, if no one suffers harm through the defendant’s act, there should be no recovery.107 Thus, the plaintiff also has to prove damages because of the defendant’s negligence and how much he should recover. 3.2 Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Unintentional Torts: A Category-by-category Approach Under the American Common Law Unlike the all-or-nothing approach in Taiwan, American law considers pure economic loss rule under a category-by-category basis. The following section will cover the content of pure economic loss rule generated by the American common law in different kinds of scenarios. When dealing with recovery for pure economic loss in unintentional tort, the American courts begin by asking whether the defendant owed the plaintiff victim a duty to prevent such harm. A. Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Products Liability Pure economic loss is generally recoverable in contract law or warranty law.108 Here, the victim often may base recovery on strict products liability because he would not have to prove either privity of contract or be subject to disclaimers.109 Whether pure economic loss is recoverable in strict products liability is an open question. During the early years of products liability, some American courts held pure economic loss was 107 See supra 16. 108 James A. Henderson, Jr. & Aaron D. Twerski, PRODUCTS LIABILITY PROBLEMS AND PROCESS 619 (2011). 109 For more details about advantages for a plaintiff victim to sue a defendant manufacture in strict products liability rather in contract law or in warranty law, see Id.   27                                                         recoverable in strict products liability110 while the majority of courts held otherwise.111 The basis for the dispute was whether, under Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A, a defendant was liable for harm to the product itself.112  Recently, Supreme Court of the United States answered this question in the negative.113 In East River Steamship,114 charters of four tankers brought suit against the defendant Delaval for damages suffered because turbines manufactured by Delaval were negligently designed, manufactured, and installed in their tankers. In finding no recovery for economic harm, the Court distinguished between contract and tort remedies. When a product injures only itself, the Court reasoned, the victim could bring suit in contract law for redress. In turn, the tort concern with safety is reduced when an injury is only to the product itself because the users stand to lose the value of products, unsatisfied expectation,115 or increased costs in using the products.116 Until then, pure economic loss is considered not recoverable in strict products liability, and Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability §21 also adopts the rule from East River Steamship:117  For purposes of the Restatement, harm to persons or property includes economic loss if caused by harm to (a) the plaintiff’s person; (b) the person of another when harm to the other interferes with an interest of the plaintiff protected by tort law; or (c) the plaintiff’s property other than the defective product itself. 110 Santor v. A and M Karagheusian, Inc., 44 N.J. 52, 66-67 (1976). 111 Seely v. White Motor Co., 403 P.2d 145, 151 (1965). 112 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS § 402A (1965). 113 See supra note 57. 114 Id. 115 The court noted such harm should be understood as warranty claim, rather than as tort. Id. at 2302. 116 Id.  117 See supra note 108 at 627.  28                                                         B. Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Public Nuisance When a person suffers pure economic loss because of a public nuisance,118 an action in tort is expected because privity of contract rarely exists between victim and tortfeasor. For example, a company negligently blocks a bridge and cuts off traffic between islands, thereby causing business interruption in nearby areas.119 Like in products liability cases, pure economic loss here generally cannot be recovered unless there’s also been physical harm to the plaintiff victims. At the same time, it seems unfair to deny damages here because — unlike product liability cases — the plaintiff here has no way to seek contractual remedies. A case from Court of Appeals of New York may help to clarify this rule and its policy concerns. In 532 Madison Ave. Gourmet Foods, Inc. v. Finlandia Ctr., Inc.,120 a commercial tower collapsed as a result of the defendant’s negligence and caused nearby areas to close for at least two weeks. The owners of nearby stores brought a tort case for recovery for lost profits arising from the interruption of their business. The court denied recovery, reasoning if the presence of members of public or other people traveling nearby was fortuitous, any economic loss they suffered would be unpredictable.121 To avoid indeterminate liability and to avoid unfairness between geographically similar plaintiffs, the court limited recovery to plaintiffs who suffered personal injury or property damage.122  118 See supra note 19. 119 See also Kinsman Transit Co. v. City of Buffalo, 388 F.2d 821 (2d Cir. 1968). 120 96 N.Y.2d 280, 750 N.E.2d 1097 (2001). 121 Id.  122 Id. at 1103. See also RESTATEMENT OF THE LAW THIRD TORTS: LIABILITY FOR ECONOMIC HARM §8 (Preliminary Draft No.2, 2013) in which the rule allows the recovery for pure economic loss within a public nuisance scenario only when a plaintiff suffered loss distinct from that suffered by the public at large.  29                                                         C. Recovery for Pure Economic Loss in Professional Malpractice: Three Approaches Identified A final case where victims may suffer pure economic loss is professional malpractice. This includes negligent misrepresentation and negligent performance of service.123 When dealing with recovery for pure economic loss in professional malpractice, American courts have taken three different approaches.124  1) From Strict Privity Rule to Near Privity Rule In Ultramares v. Touche,125 Justice Cardozo held an accounting firm not liable for pure economic loss suffered by plaintiff’s reliance on an auditing report. The defendant was hired by Fred Stern, a company not in the litigating process, to do auditing, but negligently failed to disclose the company’s insolvency in the certified balance sheet. Relying on the audit, the plaintiff made several loans to the company. After the company filed for bankruptcy, the plaintiff brought a negligence action for recovery for pure economic loss. In finding the defendant owed the plaintiff no duty of care, the court reasoned that a thoughtless slip or blunder, or the failure to detect a theft or forgery may expose accountants to an indeterminate liability for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.126 Thus, the court held that unless the accountant expressly assumes a duty by contract, pure economic loss in negligence is not recoverable.127  123 Bruce P.
