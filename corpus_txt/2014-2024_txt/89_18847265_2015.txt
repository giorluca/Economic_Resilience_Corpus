The objec-tive of this systematic review is to examine evidence from longitudinal studies on factorsinfluencing resilience for any health outcome or health behaviour among the general popu-lation living in countries exposed to financial crises.MethodsWe systematically reviewed studies from six electronic databases (EMBASE, GlobalHealth, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science) which used quantitative longitudi-nal study designs and included: (i) exposure to an economic crisis; (ii) changes in healthoutcomes/behaviours over time; (iii) statistical tests of associations of health risk and/or pro-tective factors with health outcomes/behaviours. The quality of the selected studies was ap-praised using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies. PRISMA reportingguidelines were followed.ResultsFrom 14,584 retrieved records, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria. These studies wereconducted across 10 countries in Asia, Europe and North America over the past two de-cades. Ten socio-demographic factors that increased or protected against health risk wereidentified: gender, age, education, marital status, household size, employment/occupation,income/ financial constraints, personal beliefs, health status, area of residence, and socialrelations. These studies addressed physical health, mortality, suicide and suicide attempts,mental health, and health behaviours. Women’s mental health appeared more susceptibleto crises than men’s. Lower income levels were associated with greater increases in cardio-vascular disease, mortality and worse mental health. Employment status was associatedwith changes in mental health. Associations with age, marital status, and education wereless consistent, although higher education was associated with healthier behaviours.PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 1 / 22OPEN ACCESSCitation: Glonti K, Gordeev VS, Goryakin Y, ReevesA, Stuckler D, McKee M, et al.

Future conceptual and empirical research isneeded to develop the epidemiology of resilience.IntroductionWhy are some people able to cope during economic crises while others are not? The worst eco-nomic crisis in Europe since the Great Depression has already seen marked rises in the preva-lence of poor mental health [1,2,3,4]. Suicides have risen across Europe and North America[5], especially in the countries worst affected by the crisis [6,7,8] and within these countries, inthe regions where job losses have been highest [9]. Many economies continue to stagnate whilesocial safety nets are being eroded and job security is increasingly precarious [10,11]. Yet noteveryone exposed to the consequences of economic crisis, such as job loss, bankruptcy, orhome repossession, is equally affected. Some individuals display a high degree of resiliencewhile others seem especially vulnerable [12].Resilience can be be defined as a dynamic process by which individuals, communities andsocieties positively adapt to significant adversity [13]. In light of the recent financial crisis, thevalue of resilience as a concept has been highlighted by health policy-makers and rearchers[14]. Thus, elucidating risk and protective factors that influence resilience during economic cri-ses could help inform policy responses to mitigate negative health effects of economic crises.There is considerable research on resilience in disciplines such as individual traits in psychiatry,social relationships in sociology, family relationships in psychology, responses to violence andhumanitarian crises, and systems level responses to violence, humanitarian crises, and pan-demic disease outbreak [13,15,16]. However, the evidence on health resilience and its risk andprotective factors in the context of economic crises remains unclear. As a result, the potentialvalue of resilience for developing policies to protect against the effects of economic shocks suchas those that characterize the current period of austerity is unclear. The objective of this sys-tematic review is to examine evidence from longitudinal studies on factors influencing resil-ience for any health outcome or health behaviour among the general population living incountries exposed to financial crises.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of published primary research that investigated factors relat-ed to resilience to the negative health consequences of economic crises.Inclusion criteriaStudies were included if they examined: (i) exposure to a specific economic crisis; (ii) changesin health outcomes or behaviours over time; and (iii) statistical data on associations of healthrisk and/or protective factors with health outcomes/behaviours. There were no time period re-strictions. The publication language was restricted to English only. We only considered prima-ry research studies which used quantitative longitudinal designs (panel/cohort and repeatedcross-sectional) that capture changes in these factors over time given the temporal, dynamicnature of resilience. The studies therefore had to have at least two time points of observation(i.e. pre- and/or during, and post-crisis periods).Health Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 2 / 22Competing Interests: The authors have declaredthat no competing interests exist.We identified economic crises as those meeting the criteria of “a significant decline in eco-nomic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible inreal GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. A reces-sion begins just after the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends as economy reaches itstrough”[17]. We considered a risk and/or protective factor as any attribute, characteristic or ex-posure of an individual that increases or decreases the likelihood of developing a disease or in-jury [14].Search strategySix bibliographic databases (EMBASE, Global Health, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web ofScience) were searched between July and October 2013. The broad and varied terminologyaround resilience and related concepts of vulnerability, risk and protective factors meant thatwe did not use such terms in our search in order to maximise sensitivity. To capture a broadrange of effects associated with economic crises we included the following search terms: eco-nomic shock, economic recession, recession, economic crisis, financial crisis, fiscal crisis, bank-ing crisis, economic depression, economic hardship, economic insecurity, austerity, financialconstraint, economic downturn, economic change, economic breakdown, economic turmoil,economic stagnation, economic adversity, economic turbulence, and macroeconomic fluctua-tion. In addition, references of all the final included papers were searched for articles not identi-fied through electronic searches. A full description of the search terms, strategy and screeningstages can be found in S1 Table.Study selection, data extraction and analysisResults from the bibliographic databases were merged and duplicates were removed. Two re-viewers (KG and VG) independently screened the search results by title, abstract and full text.Disagreements were resolved by discussion and consensus.We extracted the following information from the studies included in the review: country,economic crisis and years examined, study population, study design, methods of analysis, riskand protective factors, health outcome(s) and health behavioural outcome(s). Relevant infor-mation from retrieved articles was extracted for a narrative synthesis by both reviewers andsummarized in Table 1. Narrative synthesis was used due to heterogeneity in study designs,methods, risk/protective factors, health outcomes, presentation of data and study contexts. Inaddition, some of the results relevant to this review were only secondary objectives of the in-cluded papers, which made data extraction and interpretation more complex. For this reasonwe did not extract the effect sizes presented in the original studies.This review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analy-ses [18] (S1 PRISMA Checklist).Assessment of the methodological qualityWe used an adapted version of the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (developedby the Effective Public Health Practice Project [19]) to assess the methodological quality of theincluded studies (S1 Quality Appraisal). The tool contains 19 items in eight key domains: (1)study design; (2) blinding; (3) representativeness in the sense of selection bias; (4) representa-tiveness in the sense of withdrawals/drop outs; (5) confounders; (6) data collection; (7) dataanalysis; and (8) reporting. Studies can have between six and eight component ratings, witheach component score ranging from 1 (low risk-of bias; high methodological quality) to 3 (highrisk-of-bias; low methodological quality). An overall rating for each study was determined basedon the component ratings. For example, if eight ratings have been given, a rating of ‘strong’ wasHealth Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 3 /

weak rating or fewer than five strong ratings, ‘weak’ attributed to those with two or moreweak ratings. To minimize the risk of bias, assessments were completed independently by tworeviewers (KG and VG). The ratings for each of the eight domains, as well as the total rating,were compared and consensus reached on a final rating for each included article.ResultsThe results of the screening process are shown in Fig 1. In total, 14,584 articles were screenedby title and abstract for possible inclusion in the review. The full text of 104 articles were ob-tained and assessed for eligibility. Twenty two studies met the eligibility criteria and were in-cluded in the final review. The main reasons for exclusion were that papers: containeddescriptive analyses only; reported macro-level trends without reporting on individual orhousehold characteristics; were cross-sectional studies of a single point in time; and focusedsolely on health service utilization and performance.The 22 included studies were conducted in 10 countries: Finland [20,21,22,23], Greece [24],Iceland [25,26,27], Ireland [28], Japan [29,30], South Korea [31,32], Spain [1,33], Sweden[34,35], the United Kingdom (UK) [2,36,37], and the United States of America (USA) [38,39].Studies examined the following economic crises: the early 1990 recession in the UK (1991–1992), the Asian economic crisis (1997–1999), the Finnish Banking Crisis (1991–1993), theSwedish Banking Crisis (1991–1993) and the Global Economic Crisis, which encompasses theIrish financial crisis (2007–2008), US Great Recession (2007–2008), the Icelandic financial cri-sis (2008–2011), the UK financial crisis (which started in 2008), the Greek financial crisis(which started in 2008) and the Spanish financial crisis (which started in 2008).Of the 22 selected studies, nine were cohort studies [1,21,22,25,26,27,33,39,40], three wereregister-based cohort studies (20, 30, 32) and ten were repeated cross-sectional studies[2,23,24,28,29,31,35,36,37,38]. Study characteristics are shown in Table 1.We identified the following 10 broad risk/protective factors associated with health during eco-nomic crises: gender, age, education, marital status and household size, employment/occupation,income/ financial constraints, personal beliefs, health status, area of residence, and social relations.The findings related to these 10 factors are described below and in Table 2, using sub-categoriesof the following main types of health outcomes associated with the risk and/or protective factors:physical health, mortality, suicide (including attempted), mental health, and health behaviours.Methodological quality assessmentAll of the 22 included studies used an observational study design. The quality assessment of theincluded studies found that 12 had a low risk of bias and 10 had a moderate risk of bias (full de-tails are provided in S2 Table and S1 Fig). In terms of representativeness of the wider population,all of the studies were rated as ‘strong’ with the exception of one study that was rated as ‘moder-ate’. We were able to rate nine studies for representativeness relating to withdrawals and drop-outs: one study was rated as ‘weak’, five studies were rated as ‘moderate’ and three received a‘strong’ rating. Eight studies received a ‘moderate’ rating for confounding, while 14 studies wereat low risk of confounding. Four studies scored ‘weak’ on data collection as they did not provideany information about the validity and reliability of their measures; two of these studies used theGHQ questionnaire but did not provide any information on the specifics of the study population.The remaining 16 scored ‘moderate’ and two studies scored ‘strong’ for data collection. Onestudy achieved a moderate score with regards to data analysis, and the remaining 21 studies re-ceived a strong rating. One study had a moderate score in reporting quality, while the remaining22 studies showed high quality of reporting and received ‘strong’ ratings.Health Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 6 / 22GenderPhysical health, mortality and suicide (including attempted suicide). Two studieslooked for gender differences in physical health, mortality or suicide during recessions. A studyby Ostamo et al. examined the association between the economic recession in Finland (1989–1997) and trends in attempted suicides treated in health facilities in Helsinki. The 9 year studyindicated that Finland’s economic recession of the 1990s was not associated with increased at-tempted suicides, and that while suicide attempt rates among males remained higher thanamong females, they declined more than female rates during the study period [22]. Kondoet al. examined the impact of the Japanese economic recession (1991–2000) on perceivedhealth status, finding that females were more likely than males to report poor self-rated healthFig 1.

We found evidence of an association between gender and general mentalhealth status [1,2,23,33], stress levels [26], psychological distress [35], depression [24], andsleep quality [37]. The impact of economic recession on mental health in the early 1990s wasexamined in the population of three countries (UK, Finland, and Sweden) by Dregan et al.,who found that the chance of experiencing sleep problems through worry (measured by lostsleep over worry items in the GHQ-30) among individuals aged50 years was higher in fe-males than males both before (1984) and during the recession in UK. However, there was onlya marginal increase in sleep problems among females during the recession [37]. Viinamakiet al. recorded increasing levels of mental disorders (measured by GHQ-12) among both menand women during the economic recession of the early 1990s in Finland, with higher ratesamong females than males. In the post-crisis period (1995), the prevalence of mental disordersdecreased in males but remained unchanged among females [23]. Similar results were reportedby Rahmqvist et al. in their study in Sweden, with the 1991 recession (1991–1993) associatedwith increased prevalence of psychological distress in both genders relative to pre-crisis period(1989), but with the largest increase among males [35].Gili et al. assessed mental health risks in the general Spanish population and found thatmales were less likely than females to experience major depression and dysthymia both before(2006) and during the crisis years (2010–2011), but the likelihood of experiencing depressionincreased for males during the crisis period as compared to the pre-crisis period [1]. Agudelo-Suarez et al. focused on the subgroup of Spanish migrant workers and their mental health (as-sessed by the GHQ-12) and noted that both genders experienced an increase in the prevalenceof poor mental health during the crisis in 2011 (as compared to the pre-crisis period in 2008),but this was only significant for males [33]. Similar findings were reported in England, whereKatikireddi et al. examined differences in population mental health (measured using GHQ-12)during and between two economic crises (early 1990s and in 2009–2010). The prevalence ofpoor mental health was consistently higher among females than males over most of the studyperiod, but the increase in reporting poor mental health during both recessions compared withthe base year (2008) was greater among males [2].In Iceland, Hauksdottir et al. looked at changes in self-reported levels of stress as a result ofthe Icelandic economic crisis in 2008. The age-adjusted mean perceived stress levels (measuredusing the PSS-4 score) in 2009 increased significantly from 2007 levels among females but notmales, leading to increased reporting of high stress levels in females but not males during thecrisis in 2009 (as compared to the pre-crisis period in 2007) [26]. In Greece, Economou et al.described how during the crisis period (2011) the prevalence of major depression increased inboth genders as compared to the pre-crisis period (2008), but it remained higher among fe-males just as in the pre-crisis period (2008) [24].Health behaviour. Four studies investigated changes in health behaviour by gender[1,27,38,39].Bor et al. looked at alcohol consumption during the Great Recession 2008–2009 in the USAand found that males were more likely than females to engage in frequent binge-drinking dur-ing the crisis (2008–2009) but their probability of doing so was lower than before the crisis(2006–2007) [38].Gili et al. found that in the general Spanish population males (as compared to females) weremore likely to abuse alcohol (2010–2011), but to a lesser extent during the crisis than before it(2006) [1]. Macy et al. found that even before the US Great Recession (2005), females weremore likely than males to check food ingredient labels but the difference widened during thecrisis (2011). Being female was also associated with choosing food based on health values (aHealth Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 10 / 22separate outcome variable) but this association did not change significantly from before to dur-ing the crisis period [39]. A study by McClure et al. found that the prevalence of smoking fellsignificantly among men and women following the 2008 economic crisis, but the quit rate wasgreater among females [27].AgePhysical health and suicide. Kondo et al. examined the health impact of the Japanese eco-nomic recession (1991–2000) comparing pre- and post-crisis periods (1986/1989 and 1998/2001) and showed those aged 40–60 (as compared to 20–39) were more likely to report poorhealth both before (1986/1989) and after-crisis years (1998/2001), but this likelihood was lowerafter the crisis compared to the pre-crisis period [29].In their study of the Finnish economic recession (1989–1997), Ostamo et al. observed thatalthough the overall rates of attempted suicide decreased significantly among both females andmales over the whole study period, suicide attempts by 15 to 24-year-olds of both genders in-creased after 1994. Moreover, as the economic crisis unfolded, a clear decreasing trend wasnoted only among 25 to 34-year-old men [22].Mental health. We found evidence of associations between age and changes in generalmental health status [2,23], stress levels [26], depression [24], sleep disturbance [37], happiness[25,28], during economic crises.The study by Katikireddi et al. during two economic recessions in England (early 1990s andin 2009–2010)) found that changes in mental health during the recession periods were not con-fined to any specific age group (25–35, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64) [2]. Viinamaki et al. found thatduring the recession in Finland (1993), increasing age was associated with better mental health(measured by the GHQ) but only in men and only during the recession (1993). Age was not anindependent risk factor for impaired mental health, either among males or females, at the endof the crisis or in the post-crisis period (1994–1995) [23]. In a study of stress during the Icelan-dic crisis in 2009, Hauksdottir et al. found that the likelihood of experiencing high stress levelsduring the economic crisis (2009) was higher among females belonging to the 18–29, 40–49,and 60–69 age groups when compared to the same age groups in the pre-crisis period in 2007,but there was no such significant association with age for males [26].Economou et al. found that substantial increases in the prevalence of depression were foundin several age groups (<34, 25–34, 45–54, 55–64) during the Greek crisis (2011) as comparedto the pre-crisis period (2008), and also that each year increase in age decreased the chances ofmanifesting major depression [24]. Similarly, a study by Dregan et al. conducted in the UKamong individuals over50, found that during the recession in 1991 sleep loss through worrydeclined with increasing age [37]. Further evidence on the role of age was found in studies thatfocused on happiness. Doherty et al. examined individual happiness before (2003–2007) andduring (2009) the economic crisis in Ireland and found that the association between an in-crease in age (as a continuous measure) and greater happiness was stronger prior to the crisis(2003–2007) and then weakened during the crisis (2009) [28]. Gudmundsdottir observed thatthose aged 70–79 reported higher happiness levels (as compared to those aged 18–29 years)both before (2007) and during (2009) the Icelandic economics crisis [25].Health behaviours. Age was also associated with health behaviours during economic cri-ses [27,38,39]. Bor et al. found that those aged 30–49, 50–64, 65+ years (with 18–29 years as areference group for all age groups) had lower chances of being frequent binge drinkers duringthe US Great Recession in 2008–2009. The authors also noted that there was a relative increasein the likelihood of frequent binging among persons aged 25–34 and 55–59 (as compared to18–29 years old) during the crisis period (2008–2009) compared with the pre-crisis periodHealth Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 11 / 22(2006–2007) [38]. Macy et al. showed that in the US Great Recession, increased age was associ-ated with smoking on daily basis in both pre-crisis (2005) and during crisis period (2011), butthis association was weaker during the crisis period [39]. McClure et al. observed that formersmokers in older age groups (aged 40–59 and60+ vs. 18–39) had a lower chance of relapseduring the Icelandic crisis period (2009) regardless of gender. During the crisis, women in theage group 30–39 were less likely to quit smoking compared to women aged 18–29 [27].EducationSuicide (including attempted suicide). Lee et al. found that increases in suicides wereconcentrated among those with lower education during and after the economic crisis of 1997in South Korea, in both genders and all age groups [32].Mental health. Several studies examined associations between education level and changesin general mental health status [2], stress levels [26] and depression [1,24] during economic cri-ses. Katikireddi et al. observed that adjustment for changes in educational level did not explainthe increases in poor mental health among men or women during two economic recessions inEngland (in the early 1990s and in 2008 onwards) [2]. However, Hauksdottir et al. found thatthe likelihood of experiencing high stress levels during times of crisis (2009 vs. 2007) washigher among individuals with a middle level of education (grades 7–12), but not in those withbasic education (grades 1–6) and university. More specifically, sub-group analysis by sex re-vealed that increased risks of experiencing high stress levels were observed among females withmiddle and basic education during the crisis in 2009 as compared to the pre-crisis period in2007 (but not with higher education level or males) [26]. Gili et al. also found that a college/graduate school level of education (reference groups: primary school/no schooling) was associ-ated with a lower risk of having major depressive disorder during the crisis in Spain in 2010,while this association was not significant during the pre-crisis period (2006). Similarly, college/graduate school (as compared to those with primary school/no schooling) also had a lower riskof experiencing dysthymia, and this likelihood was higher during the economic crisis period(2010) than the pre-crisis period (2006) [1]. Those with complete high school education (ascompared to primary school/no schooling) were also less likely to experience dysthymia duringthe crisis, but this association was not significant during the pre-crisis period [1]. Economouet al. found that a significant increase in the prevalence of major depression was observedamong all education groups (<11 years, 12 years,>12 years) following the economic crisis inGreece when compared to the pre-crisis period (2008) [24].Health behaviours. Gili et al. observed that higher education was negatively associatedwith alcohol abuse during the Spanish crisis in 2010 [1]. Similarly, Bor et al. found that duringthe US Great Recession in 2008–2009, those with a college degree were less likely to becomefrequent binge drinkers, as compared to those with less than a high school education [38].Macy et al. also documented that having a higher education was associated with engaging inhealthy behaviours (e.g. choosing food based on nutritional value, increased frequency of vig-orous exercise, wearing a seatbelt and not smoking) both before and after the crisis but the as-sociations generally weakened during the crisis [39]. McClure et al. demonstrated that womenwith middle or university level education (compared to basic) were more likely to quit smokingduring the crisis (2009) as compared to the pre-crisis period (2007) [27]. Gili et al. also foundthat a higher level of education (compared to primary school/no schooling) was equally associ-ated with a lower risk of alcohol abuse both before (2006) and during the economic crisis inSpain in 2010. Also, those with completed high school education (compared to primaryschool/no schooling) were less likely to abuse alcohol during the crisis period as compared tothe pre-crisis period [1].Health Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 12 / 22Marital status and children in householdPhysical health. Kondo et al. found that those who had never married (as compared tomarried) were more likely to report poor self-rated health following the Japanese economic re-cession (1991–2000) when compared to the pre-crisis period. In addition, the chances ofexperiencing poor self-rated health among divorced (as compared to married) people de-creased in the post-crisis period as compared to the pre-crisis period. Those separated (as com-pared to married) were also more likely to experience poor health in the pre-crisis period, butafter the crisis this difference was not observed [29].Mental health. There was evidence from three studies of associations between marital sta-tus and stress levels [26], depression [24] and happiness [25] during economic crises. Hauks-dottir et al. found that the probability of experiencing high stress levels during the crisis inIceland (2009 vs. pre-crisis period in 2007) was greater among married and/or cohabiting per-sons but not in single/divorced or widowed. This held true for both genders, however, single/divorced females were also reported as being more likely to experience high stress levels duringthe crisis period (as compared to the pre-crisis period) [26]. Economou et al., in their study ofthe Greek economic crisis in 2011, observed a significant increase in the prevalence of majordepression among single and married individuals, but not those widowed and divorced. Duringthe crisis, married (as compared to single) had a higher chance of experiencing major depres-sion [24]. Gudmundsdottir found that being married, committed in a relationship, or cohabit-ing, but not divorced or widowed (with being single as the reference group), was the strongestpredictor of happiness both before (2007) and during the Icelandic economic crisis (2009)[25]. Hauksdottir et al. found that the chances of experiencing high stress levels during the Ice-landic economic crisis (2009 versus pre-crisis period in 2007) were higher among persons withno children in the household, but not in households with one child or more. A gender-sub-group analysis confirmed this observation, but only for females without children [26].Health behaviours. Bor et al. found that during the 2008–2009 period of the US Great Re-cession frequent binge drinkers were more likely to be unmarried [38]. Macy et al. observedthat being married was associated with engaging in healthy behaviours (choosing food basedon nutritional value, wear seatbelt and not smoke) before the US recession (2005). During thecrisis period (2011), these associations strengthened, with the exception of seatbelt wearingwhere the association decreased, and new associations with exercising vigorously and checkingfood labels became significant [39]. Bor et al. also found that those with children aged<18 inthe household were less likely to be frequent binge drinkers during the US Great Recession in2008–2009 [38].Employment/OccupationPhysical health. Three studies investigated the effect of employment/occupation on physi-cal health status [29,31,36]. Kim et al. examined changes in employment-related health in-equalities according to occupational position among employed individuals in South Korea. Theauthors observed that the 1997 economic crisis was associated with a widening health gap inemployment type related health inequalities in both professional and non-professional occupa-tions, and for both genders. In addition, following the crisis the health gap continuously wid-ened between female temporary/daily employees (limited contractual work of less than oneyear or daily contractual work of duration of one month or less) and those with permanent em-ployment. A similar pattern was observed with daily male employees compared with perma-nently employed male employees [31]. In the study by Kondo et al. of the health impact of theJapanese economic recession (1991–2000), there was no association between occupational sta-tus and self-rated health among economically active people (managerial/administrative,Health Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 13 / 22professional, clerical/sales/service, manual, or any other paid job) before crisis. However, afterthe crisis, professionals, middle-class non-manual workers (clerical/sales/service), and otherpaid workers were more likely to report poor health compared to the highest class of workers(managerial/administrative). Unemployed and homemakers (when compared with the highestclass workers, i.e. managerial/administrative) were more likely to report poor health both priorand following the crisis. More specifically, gender sub-group analysis showed that male mid-dle-class non-manual workers (clerical/sales/service), as compared to high-class managerial/administrative workers, were more likely to report poor perceived health after economic crisis(1998–2001) as compared to the pre-crisis period (1986–1989). Similar findings apply to fe-male homemakers and those unemployed in the post-crisis period. Among men, the unem-ployed were less likely to report poor health (compared to high-class managerial/administrative workers) during the post-crisis period as compared to the pre-crisis period [29].Astell-Burt et al. investigated whether the prevalence of poor health at a population level in-creased concurrently with the rise in unemployment during the UK economic recession thatstarted in 2008. During the crisis period (2008 and onwards) the likelihood of reporting poorself-rated health was higher among the unemployed compared to the employed, who also hada higher chance of having health problems such as respiratory and cardiovascular health prob-lems (2009 and onwards) [36].Mortality and suicide. Martikainen et al. examined the effects of unemployment on mor-tality following workplace downsizing and closure during the Finnish crisis of the early 1990s.The authors found that unemployed (as compared to employed individuals) were more likelyto die during the crisis (1994), but the difference was less than in the pre-crisis period (1989).In addition, the crisis did not impact the association between unemployment and excess mor-tality among those who had been employed at workplaces undergoing large reductions in em-ployment. Interestingly, mortality was lower among those who worked in a closed orsubstantially downsized establishment than among those working in establishments with a sta-ble workforce size [21]. The study by Montgomery et al. of the Swedish crisis of the early 1990sexamined the association between unemployment and all-cause mortality among men only.During the crisis (1990), unemployment was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mor-tality in people at all levels of cognitive function and education. This association was greatestamong less well educated (compulsory education, up to 9 years) men and men with poor cogni-tive function, whereas after the crisis (2001) people with higher cognitive function and highereducation were at greater relative risk of mortality following unemployment [34]. Wada et al.examined the impact of the Asian Crisis (1997–1999) on men in Japan by occupation andfound that age-standardized mortality rates for the leading causes of death steadily decreasedover the time (1980–2005) in all occupations, though managerial and professional workers hada lower risk of death in the pre-crisis period (compared to non-managerial and unemployed),but an increased risk of all-cause mortality during the economic crisis. The authors also founda rapid increase in suicides from the start of the Japanese crisis among all workers, with thegreatest increase among management-level workers and professionals [30].Mental health. There is evidence of an association between employment/occupation andgeneral mental health status [2,23,33], stress levels [26], psychological distress [35], happiness[25] depression and mental illness [24,36], and sleep disturbances [37]. Rahmqvist et al., in astudy of those aged 20–39 in the Swedish population, found the overall prevalence of psycho-logical stress in the non-employed groups was consistently higher than in the employed group,throughout the studied period (1989–1995) in both genders. The authors also noted an in-creased likelihood of experiencing psychological stress (measured by GHQ) during the crisis ofthe early 1990s (1991–1995) as compared to the pre-crisis period (1989) in both gendersHealth Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 14 / 22(analysed separately). When limiting the analysis to employed individuals only, the increase inlikelihood of experiencing psychological stress was retained [35].Agudelo-Suarez et al. observed an increase in the prevalence of poor mental health between2008 and 2011 (pre and during crisis periods) among employed and unemployed migrants ofboth genders, with particularly higher increase among unemployed of both genders. However,only in males did unemployment act as a significant predictor of poor mental health during thecrisis (2011) when compared to the pre-crisis period (2009)[33]. Gili et al. also found thatbeing unemployed (compared to employed) during the economic crisis in Spain (2010) carriedeven higher risk of experiencing both minor and major depressive disorders, generalized anxi-ety and multi-somatoform disorders, but not dysthymia or panic attack disorder, as comparedto the pre-crisis period (2006). In addition, living in a household with unemployed familymembers also increased the risk of major depression during the crisis (2010) [1]. These find-ings were in line with those of Astell-Burt et al. who recorded how those unemployed (com-pared to employed) were more likely to report depression and poor mental health during the2008 UK crisis (2009 and onwards) [36]. However, Katikireddi et al. observed that changes inemployment status did not explain increases in poor mental health status in either males or fe-males during two recessions recession in England (early 1990s and 2008 and onwards) [2].Hauksdottir et al. found that employed individuals and students (but not unemployed, home-makers/being on parental leave, disabled or retired) had higher chances of experiencing highstress levels during the Icelandic economics crisis (2009) as compared to the pre-crisis period(2007). However, when the analysis was confined to women, a broader range of employmentstatus (employed, students, being a homemaker/parental leave, and unemployed) were foundto have an increased risk of experiencing high stress compared to the pre-crisis period. Occupa-tional status was also analysed, with both non-skilled and skilled (but not executives) morelikely to experience high stress levels during the crisis as compared to the pre-crisis period. Instratified analysis, occupation was important in predicting the experience of high stress levelsduring the crisis, as compared to the pre-crisis period, among non-skilled and no paid employ-ment females. No significant association was observed for men [26]. Dregan et al. also foundthat, among individuals over the age of 50 in the UK, retirees were less likely to experiencesleep loss through worry during the recession (1991), but not prior to the recession (1984–1985) [37]. Gudmundsdottir found that unemployment was associated with lower levels ofhappiness both before (2007) and after the 2008 Icelandic economic crisis (2009), and this as-sociation was stronger during the economic crisis [25]. Economou et al. found a significant in-crease in the prevalence of major depression in both employed and unemployed individualsduring the Greek economic crisis (2011), as compared to the pre-crisis period (2008) [24].Health behaviours. Four studies examined the role of employment/occupation on healthbehaviours [1,27,38,39]. Gili et al. found that during the Spanish economic crisis (2010) the un-employed (compared to employed) were at greater risk of alcohol abuse compared to the pre-crisis period (2006) [1]. Bor et al. also found that during the Great US Recession those whowere unemployed for less than a year were more likely to be frequent binge drinkers whereashomemakers, students, retirees and those unable to work were less likely to be frequent bingedrinkers (all compared to wage-employed) [38]. Macy et al. did not observe a significant associ-ation between change in work status or hours worked with health behaviours after adjustmentin multivariate regression analysis [39]. In their study of the Iceland crisis, McClure et al.found that an individual’s employment status was not associated with their risk of having asmoking relapse, but retired women who had quit smoking at baseline (in 2007) were at in-creased risk of relapsing during the crisis, compared to employed women. Women not workingbecause of disability, as compared to those employed, had also increased chances of quitting in2009, as compared to 2007 [27].Health Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 15 / 22Income/financial constraintsPhysical health and mortality. Lammintausta et al. analysed the effects of the FinnishBanking Crisis (1991–1995) on socioeconomic disparities in the incidence of coronary heartdisease and corresponding mortality. The overall mortality and incidence rates, lower in fe-males than males, were higher among low income tertiles in both genders (compared with mid-dle and high income tertiles). The economic crisis did not affect the underlying downwardtrend in mortality and incidence rates among low and middle income tertiles in both genders,but the downward trend among those in the highest tertile slowed [20].Mental health. There is evidence of associations between income/financial constraints,and general mental health status [2,23,29,33], stress levels [26], depression [1,24], sleep distur-bances [37] and happiness [25]. Kondo et al.’s study of the Japanese economic recession (1991–2000) found that both females and males in the lowest income decile (as compared to the high-est) were more likely to report poor mental health prior to the crisis than after the crisis (29).The study on migrant workers in Spain between 2008 and 2011 recorded an increase in theprevalence of poor mental health status in those migrants of both genders with low salaries(below €1200 per month) but not those with monthly salaries above €1200. Low-earning males(but not females) were more likely to experience poor mental health during the crisis (2011) ascompared to pre-crisis period (2008) [33]. Hauksdottir et al. found that the likelihood ofexperiencing high stress levels during the Icelandic crisis (2009 vs. pre-crisis period in 2007)was higher among female and males in the middle income bracket but not those with low orhigh income [26]. Additionally, financial hardship (as assessed by the index of personal eco-nomic distress) was found to be a predictor of major depression during the Greek crisis in 2011[24]. Similarly, Gili et al. found that mortgage repayment difficulties and evictions were associ-ated with elevated risk of major depression in Spain during economic crisis in 2010 [1]. In Ice-land, financial difficulty (defined as “difficult making ends meet”) was negatively associatedwith happiness during the crisis (2009)[25]. Dregan et al. found that, among individuals overthe age of 50 in the UK, financial problems over the last year appeared to be one of the majorpredictors of sleep disturbances during the 1991 recession but not in the pre-recession period(1984–1985)[37]. However, Katikireddi et al. found that adjustment for income did not explainchanges in prevalence of poor general mental health status in either men or women during twoeconomic financial recession in England (early 1990s and 2008 onwards) [2].Health behaviours. Three studies examined the role of income/financial strain on healthbehaviours [27,38,39]. Bor et al. found that white Americans with household incomes over US$ 25,000 (compared to those earning<US$ 25,000) were more likely to engage in frequentbinge drinking during the financial crisis of 2008–2009 [38]. Macy et al. found that reportingmore financial strain was negatively associated with engaging in healthy behaviours (checkinglabels on purchased food, choose food based on nutritional value, frequent vigorous exercise,and seatbelt wearing and not smoking) before the crisis (2005) and there were even strongernegative associations during the crisis (2011). This negative association during the crisis period(as compared to pre-crisis period) was higher for checking labels on purchased food, choosingfood based on nutritional value, frequently vigorously exercising, did not change for not smok-ing, and weakened for seatbelt wearing. The authors also found that men who moved from alower income group (pre-crisis) to a higher income group (during the crisis) experienced an in-creased risk of smoking relapse, while men in the high income group before the crisis whose in-come dropped during the crisis had a decreased risk of relapsing [39]. McClure et al. foundthat male former smokers who moved into the high-income group in 2009 (as compared to2007) experienced an increased risk of relapse (compared to those staying within lower incomeHealth Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 16 / 22group in 2009), while those with high income at baseline (2007) whose incomes dropped (ascompared to those with high income in 2009) had a decreased risk of relapsing [27].Personal beliefsMental health. There was evidence from two studies of an association between personalbeliefs (including spiritual and political beliefs) and general mental health status [23] and hap-piness [28].Viinamaki et al. found that lack of confidence about the future was a predictor of impairedmental well-being in both genders during and after the recession in 1990s in Finland. Its role asa predictor was particularly high at the onset of the economic crisis (1993) among males [23].Doherty et al. observed positive associations with happiness of greater community trust, reli-gious belief, and satisfaction with democracy, before and during the Irish economic crisis(2009). However, only the association between happiness and greater religious belief changedsignificantly during the crisis, with it increasing in 2009 compared with previous years [28].Health statusMental health. There is evidence of associations between physical health status and gener-al mental health status [23], happiness [25], and sleep loss [37]. Poor self-perceived physicalhealth was a predictor of impaired mental health in females at the onset of the recession (1993)and during the recession and post-recession periods for males (1994–1995)[23]. Gudmunds-dottir found that the association between better individual health status and happiness wasstronger before (2007) than during the Icelandic economic crisis (2009) [25].Dregan et al. found that health problems were the main predictor of sleep loss throughworry (among individuals ages 50 and over) during both the pre-recession (1984–1985) and re-cession periods (1991) in the UK, but that this association was weaker during the recession pe-riod [37].Area of residenceMental health. There is mixed evidence of associations between area of residence and gen-eral mental health status [2] and stress levels [26]. Katikireddi at al found no significant differ-ences in the likelihood of poor mental health during two recessions in England (early 1990sand 2008 onwards) by area/level deprivation [2]. Whereas Hauksdottir found that the chancesof experiencing high stress levels during the crisis (2009 versus pre-crisis period in 2007) werehigher among females (but not males) residing in a city or village, but not in a farming commu-nity [26].Social relationsMental health. There is evidence of associations between social relations and general men-tal health status [23,33] and happiness [25]. Agudelo-Suarez et al. observed an increase in theprevalence of poor mental health between 2008 and 2011 in migrants of both genders (with thehighest increase among males) in Spain who reported having someone financially dependentin their countries of origin compared with those who did not. However, a higher chance ofexperiencing poor mental health during the crisis (2011), as compared to the pre-crisis period(2009), was seen only among males (and not females) with such relatives, and not in thosewithout such dependents [33].Viinamaki et al. found that both sexes suffered impaired mental health when experiencingproblems with their partner in a relationship during the economic crisis. In the post-recessionHealth Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 17 / 22period, this remained important for women but became less important for men [23]. Gud-mundsdottir found that more satisfactory social relationships with family members and friendswere predictors of happiness both before (2007) and during the Icelandic crisis (2009), but theassociation became weaker during the crisis period [25].DiscussionThe importance of understanding the characteristics of those who can withstand adversity hasbeen recognised for many years, most notably by Antonovsky in his studies of Holocaust survi-vors [41]. However, work on such resilience has so far attracted little attention with respect toeconomic crises. Thus, to our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically review the evi-dence on risk and protective factors for health during economic crises. From the 22 studies thatmet our inclusion criteria, we identified 10 risk/protective factors associated with health duringeconomic crises. These included age, gender, education, marital status and household size, em-ployment/occupation, income/financial constraint, personal beliefs, health status, area of resi-dence, and social relations.It is not possible to ascertain from the identified literature whether those affected most werethose who experienced the greatest shock or displayed the least resilience. An engineer, testingthe resilience of a structure, would ascertain both the scale and nature of the shock to which itwas exposed and the resulting response. However, the literature reviewed here only measuresthe net effect of shock and response. Consequently, the evidence offers some insight into vul-nerability, which encompasses both the risk that an individual will be exposed to a shock (forexample, by being in unstable employment or with low education) and the effect that the shockhas on the individual, but less insight into the broader concept of resilience [42].While recognising these limitations, the findings provide some insight onto factors influenc-ing health outcomes and behaviours. Among the demographic factors, the results on the role ofgender were ambiguous, although crises appeared to have a greater negative impact on mentalhealth for women than men. This is somewhat surprising given the extensive evidence thatmen tend to be more likely to complete suicides during crises [9,43] and raises questions aboutthe validity of the methods used, with a number of possible biases arising, such as response,survivorship bias, and social desirability. However, as noted above, what is missing is the po-tentially differential scale of the shock experienced. Thus, within Europe the consequences ofjob loss vary for men and women depending on the type of welfare state [44].There was no consistent pattern according to age. Again, it is conceivable that the economicimpact of crises on different ages will vary, reflecting different policy choices, such as whethergovernments protect pensions or invest in job creation schemes, which will benefit those ofworking ages. The impact of marital status also varied, which is again surprising given the bodyof previous evidence that unmarried men are especially vulnerable during political and eco-nomic difficulties [45].Among the socio-economic risk-factors, lower income levels were associated with greatervulnerability to outcomes such as cardiovascular disease, overall mortality and poor mentalhealth. In general, those with more precarious employment were more vulnerable to mental illhealth. The association with education was mixed, although higher education seemed tobe protective.The most commonly examined health outcomes were mental health (general mental health,stress, depression) and changes in (un)healthy behaviours, followed by physical health andmortality (including attempted and completed suicides). These outcomes were likely chosensince most studies covered a short period of time that precluded measurement of longer-termchanges in outcomes.Health Resilience to Economic CrisesPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0123117 April 23, 2015 18 / 22The methodological quality of the studies was generally good, with most of the studies ratedas ‘strong’ and having a ‘high quality’ of reporting (low or moderate risk of bias). However, allof the studies included in this review examined one of three possible combinations: pre- andpost-crisis; pre-crisis and during crisis; or during crisis and post-crisis periods. A longitudinalstudy design capturing all three periods would be more appropriate to examine the changingrole of a specific factor as the crisis unfolds. This reinforces the case for establishing long-termmonitoring systems, ideally with panel data, such as the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Sur-vey and the German Socioeconomic Panel [46,47].A greater variety of analytical methods could also be employed to examine the causal rela-tionships between risk and/or protective factors and outcomes. For example, methods such asdynamic modelling or structural equation modelling could be useful to examine underlying re-lationship between factors and causality. The use of multilevel modelling could better under-stand community- and macro-level influences on health outcomes.More conceptually, future studies are required that expand the approach to understandinghealth risks, vulnerability and resilience during financial crises. Few studies adopted a compre-hensive approach to a wide range of factors potentially associated with health outcomes, andthere is some evidence that the impact of the financial crisis cannot always be adequately ex-plained by conventionally accepted demographic or socio-economic factors [40]. Future stud-ies should therefore go beyond the standard demographic and socioeconomic factors typicallyincluded in the papers in this review, and examine other potential factors, such as elements ofsocial capital such as social relations and networks, sources of support, and trust, which havebeen shown to influence health in other settings [48,49,50]. As noted above, research is also re-quired to understand community- and macro-level influences on health. Importantly, suchwork should incorporate the more comprehensive concept of resilience.Another related limitation was the lack of reference in the studies to any theoretical frame-work used to inform study design. Inclusion of such frameworks could help to understand thephenomenon under study. For example, while a number of potentially appropriate frameworksexist on vulnerability and resilience which could be extremely valuable in the context of finan-cial crises [13,15,51], empirical research has yet to apply or test such frameworks.This review is subject to certain limitations. One is restricting the search to English languagearticles. Another is the exclusion of grey literature, but a preliminary search found no grey liter-ature meeting the inclusion criteria. The review also employed narrative analysis, rather thanmeta-analysis, but this was due to the heterogeneity of study designs, outcomes, exposures, andrisk and protective factors. It should also be acknowledged that even in an economy notexperiencing a defined recession, a large number of people can experience individual economicshocks such as losing jobs or having homes repossessed. Conversely, a large proportion of peo-ple in an economy experiencing recession may not experience any fall in living standards. Suchnuances are important, but were outside the scope of the paper. It should also be recognisedthat many developing countries have very low standards of living. So, even if they do not expe-rience “economic crises” in the definitional sense of the word, and their economies may in factbe growing at fast rates, the people living there will have much lower standards of living thanpeople living in the west during the crisis
