Abstract 
In the last years has been performed a huge number of research related to nutrients (mainly N and 
P) recovery from waste water in order to promote their reuse and also to avoid eutrophication. 
Recovering nutrient from waste water can promote the circular economy, minimize the 
environmental footprint of waste water treatment and reduce anthropogenic alteration of nitrogen 
and phosphorus natural cycle. 
Among the different techniques studied, sorption is nowadays one of the most interesting 
alternatives as requires less energy than electrochemical or membrane technologies and sorbents 
can be regenerated for being reused. Thus, the overall sorption performance of different ion 
exchangers was characterized for nutrient recovery from waste water treatment plant effluents. 
Two commercial polymeric ion exchangers doped with Hydrated Ferrous Oxide (HFO) (Lewatit 
FO36 and Fiban-As) were assessed for phosphate uptake from waste water streams. Equilibrium 
and kinetics studies have been performed through batch experiments and the dynamic studies 
were carried out by fixed-bed column. The experimental study covered from the simplest 
monocomponent synthetic water (phosphate solutions) to the most complex real water from waste 
water treatment plant (WWTP) which contains ions, TSS and organic matter. 
Sorption experiments reported for both sorbents high selectivity towards phosphate ions as sorption 
capacity did not significantly decrease in presence of competing ions. Loaded sorbents were 
regenerated through alkaline and acid desorption in order to reuse resin and obtain a high 
concentrated phosphate solution, which could be used for high quality fertilizer production. Results 
in dynamic flow experiments reported up to 80% of loaded phosphate extraction, although during 
desorption process was observed sorption capacity decrease up to 30% after three sorption-
desorption working cycles. 
Besides, salt modified synthetic zeolites were assessed for being used both as one charge (di-
valent forms) and reusable (mono-valent forms) sorbent. Raw zeolites provided in sodium form as 
well as it modification in potassium form showed high sorption capacity for ammonium uptake but 
poor performance for phosphate recovery from waste water streams as the sorption mechanism is 
mainly ion exchange. Regeneration experiments showed that both Ze-Na and Ze-K can be reused 
several sorption-desorption working cycles without significant sorption capacity decrease (< 5%). 
Nevertheless, after salt modification to calcium and magnesium forms, the precipitation of 
phosphate salts was favoured obtaining hydroxyapatite and struvite in loaded Ze-Ca and Ze-Mg, 
respectively. As hydroxyapatite’s solubility and phosphorus availability is similar to commercial 
fertilizers, loaded Ze-Ca could be potentially recycled for agricultural uses. 
Finally, an economic assessment simulation was performed by applying Ze-Ca in the Baix 
Llobregat Waste Water Treatment Plant, located in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. The study 
reported that the implantation Ze-Ca filtration for nutrient recovery would be economically feasible, 
despite that more research is required in order to fit technical issues as the loaded sorbent disposal 
or the capability of loaded zeolites to be used as fertilizer.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1. Environmental Impact of Nitrogen and Phosphorus Cycles alteration 
Human alteration of ecosystem by transforming native soils to cultivated fields and pasture for 
supplying the growing world food demand with more than 7 billion people altered intensively 
nitrogen and phosphorus cycles as large amounts of reactive nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are 
needed for crop production (Groffman and Rosi-Marshall, 2013). 
The largest source of N on Earth is the atmospheric N2(g), which is not a component of the common 
rocks on Earth’s crust. Thus, the use of N by primary producers depends on the fixation of N2(g) 
into soluble forms. The increase in fossil fuel combustion as well as major technological advance 
for N2(g) fixation by Haber-Bosch process drove to doubling global N fixation since 1950 (Galloway 
et al., 2003; Galloway and Cowling, 2002). The human alteration of nitrogen natural cycle interacts 
with atmosphere, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems causing a series of air and water quality 
problems is illustrated in the Figure 1.1. 
 
 
Figure 1.1: The human alteration of Nitrogen cycle (Galloway and Cowling, 2002) 
Phosphorus is an essential element for life and plays a crucial role in limiting primary production in 
agricultural ecosystems as 20 million metric tons of P are mined per year for fertilizer production 
(Cordell et al., 2011; Mayer et al., 2016; Reijnders, 2014; Schipanski and Bennett, 2012). As can 
be observed in the Figure 1.2, human activity has heavily unbalanced the phosphorus global cycle

by using in days or years what in the nature least millions of years to create (Bennett and Schipanski, 
2013). 
 
 
Figure 1.2: Anthropogenic Global Phosphorus Cycle  (Cordell et al., 2009) 
 
Moreover, phosphatic  rock is present in small quantities on Earth (Filippelli, 2008) and it is located 
in just few countries or regions that have P-rich deposits, namely United States, China, Morocco 
and the Western Sahara (Jasinski, 2015; Mayer et al., 2016). In addition, evaluation of the supply 
chain reveals that almost 80% of mined phosphorus is lost during the extraction process (Schröder 
et al., 2010). 
Aquatic ecosystem is one of the most affected by nitrogen and phosphorus massive use as fertilizer 
due to both soil erosion and mining process losses, which result in an excess of nutrients in surface 
water leading to eutrophication (Manuel, 2014). Excessive nutrient loading on receiving waterways 
has been identified worldwide as the main contributor to the degradation of water quality as well as 
significant reduction in aquatic life diversity (Aloe et al., 2014). P is limited in estuarine and 
freshwater systems whereas N tend to be limited in marine systems (Water Environment 
Federation, 2010).

1.2. Resource Management 
The linear value chains that begin with the extraction of a natural resource and end with its safety 
disposal turns to the current schema of circular economy where materials can be recycled and 
returned into the economy as secondary raw materials, increasing the security of supply 
(Caspersen and Ganrot, 2018; Scholz, 2017). 
Recycling mineral nutrients and energy from household wastewater is a key step more in the 
development of a circular economy based society and became a key priority in EU’s action plan for 
the Circular Economy (European Commission, 2015). Due to the world’s continuing growing 
population as well as energy crisis, WWTPs are not any more considered as pollution removal 
facilities (van der Hoek et al., 2016; Vaneeckhaute et al., 2018) and efforts are focused on the 
materials and energy recovery and promotes the search for technologies aimed to source 
separation and revalorization (Kabbe et al., 2017; Ribanova et al., 2017; Scholz, 2017; Wang et al., 
2017) by integrating low-energy consumption processes in wastewater treatment layouts (Chen et 
al., 2015).  
As the N and P consumed in food exceeds the nutritional requirements, it results in small 
assimilation (Jonsson et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2008) and the remainder goes to WWTPs. In addition, 
nutrient containing streams can be also used for metal, minerals and energy recovery (Drexler et 
al., 2014; Peccia and Westerhoff, 2015). 
 
1.2.1. Phosphorus 
As can be observed in Figure 1.3, the continuous growth in population causes the increasing use 
of fertilizers, resulted in an increasing demand of phosphoric rocks as agricultural food production 
accounts for approximately 90% of mined phosphate rock (Cordell et al., 2009; Smil, 2002).  
 
 
Figure 1.3: Trends of fertilizer consumption in the world  (Röhling, 2010)

Currently, reuse of wastewater-derived P is mostly performed through effluent reuse and land 
application of sewage sludge (Mihelcic et al., 2011). Conventional chemical precipitation of 
phosphates by using iron and aluminum salts can efficiently incorporate P into solids, although 
obtained P containing minerals reports very low solubility, which means not being bioavailable for 
crop growth. (Mihelcic et al., 2011; Muster et al., 2013).  
Thus, the most P-recovery process relies on precipitation/crystallization of struvite or 
hydroxyapatite (HAP) for recovering secondary phosphate minerals that can be used by the 
fertilizer industry. In fact, due to its solubility and bioavailability, HAP is a substitute that can be 
directly compared to rock phosphate (Cornel and Schaum, 2009). 
 
1.2.2. Nitrogen 
Recovery of N is often considered a lower priority than energy or P recovery as the atmosphere 
supplies an almost unlimited amount of N that can be recovered using the Haber-Bosch process 
(Burn, 2014). However, it is important to notice that Haber-Bosch process used for fertilizer 
production is a high energy consuming endothermic reaction, which accounts approximately 1% of 
global energy consumption and contributes to substantial Greenhouse Gas emissions (Dinar and 
Mendelsohn, 2011; Puchongkawarin et al., 2014).  
Therefore, the recovery of N from WWTPs is one of the challenges to achieve the sustainability of 
these facilities. One of the most widely studied approach for recovering N from domestic 
wastewater is ammonia stripping from anaerobic digestion supernatants followed by a sorption step, 
in combination with biogas production and struvite precipitation (Boehler et al., 2015).  
Other approaches are being studied, which are not focused on fertilizer industry but for direct use 
as food and feed by recovering N as microbial protein (Matassa et al., 2015). Nevertheless, it 
requires a full re-engineering of WWTPs. 
 
1.2.3. Metals 
A survey of metals in U.S. municipal sludge found levels between 1 – 30 g/ kg dry solid of Na, Ca, 
P, K, Mg, Fe, Al and Ti. However, despite they are in smaller concentration in waste water effluents, 
according to their enrichment in municipal wastewater compared to soil and their market price, the 
most promising metals to recover includes Au, Ag or Ti (Peccia and Westerhoff, 2015; Westerhoff 
et al., 2015). 
As P and N, K is also an essential macronutrient for plant growth, therefore K recovery from 
wastewater effluents could help to satisfy global demand replacing its mineral form (Batstone et al., 
2014; Carey et al., 2016). The recovery path includes the precipitation of potassium struvite, 
achieving simultaneous recovery of P and K (O’Neal and Boyer, 2015). 
Currently it is estimated that 360 tons of Au is accumulated annually in wastewater sludge and, in 
the future, metal concentration in municipal sludge may increase mainly due to the manufacture 
and use of nanomaterials. In fact, nowadays, more than 60% of produced nano-Ti and nano-Ag 
Chapter 1. Introduction 
5 
 
each year are found in municipal WWTPs (Gottschalk et al., 2009; Mueller and Nowack, 2008; 
Wiesner et al., 2006). 
 
1.2.4. Energy 
A significant quantity of waste biomass is generated as a result of current enhanced biological 
treatment of nutrient containing waste streams (Energy Information Administration, 2006), which 
can be digested for renewable energy recovery by producing bio-methane or hydrogen. 
Studies revealed that only about 25 – 30% of available energy and nutrient is recovered from waste 
biomass and, between 30 – 80% of N and 15 – 18% of P are lost prior any form of recovery 
(Milbrandt, 2005). 
Therefore, it is a great opportunity for enhancing the generation of renewable energy from nutrient 
containing wastewater streams. In addition, simultaneous recovery of energy and nutrients from 
wastewater also can alleviate major environmental problems related to nutrient pollution in ground 
and surface water sources (Carey et al., 2016). 
 
1.3. Regulation 
A review of legal framework regarding P discharge limits reported that Africa and Latin American 
are the regions with more permissive regulations as in most countries there are no P discharge 
limit and, for example, in Chile, the Total Phosphorus (TP) limit in discharged water is set in the 
range 2 mg/L– 15 mg/L depending on the discharged media (lakes or rivers, respectively) 
(República de Chile, 2001). 
Nowadays, most European WWTPs have a TP limit in the range 1mg/L – 2 mg/L as France or 
Spain. However, some countries such as the United Kingdom reported more restrictive regulation 
as maximum permitted TP is set on 0.3 mg/L (Comisión Europea, 2017). 
In the United States, mots of WWTPs have a TP limit in the range of 0.5 mg/L – 1.5 mg/L although 
some states such as Massachusetts (0.1 mg/L), New Hampshire (0.2 mg/L) or Michigan and 
Maryland (0.3 mg/L) have lower permit limits (USEPA, 2017).  
Thus, N and P discharge limits will become increasingly stringent as is reported a growing concern 
of the worldwide Governments for improving surface water quality and for protecting aquatic 
environment towards eutrophication through the control of specially P inputs from WWTPs (Bashar 
et al., 2018).  
 
1.4. Available technologies for nutrient removal and recovery from WWTP 
Most of waste water treatment plants are composed by the water line where the wastewater is 
treated and by the sludge line where the sludge is separated from the water and purged or recycled 
(Fung and Wibowo, 2013).

Currently, in most WWTP worldwide, N and P are removed from wastewater streams by enhanced 
biological nutrient removal, which is not capable to reach required low levels of P. Thus, the 
remaining P content is precipitated with iron or aluminum salts resulting in biologically non-
profitable phosphorus based minerals due to its low solubility.  
Moreover, huge amount of sludge is produced, which reported difficulties in its management as 
well as low reusability. Thus, in the last years, several studies have been focused on integrating 
nutrient recovery processes in WWTPs working schema.  
Barat et al. (2009) evaluated the ammonium and phosphate content as well as flow rate and pH 
value of ten sampling points in a WWTP from Murcia, Spain. WWTP working schema is shown in 
Figure 1.4 and streams characterization results are reported in Table 1.1.

Based on data shown in the Table 1.1, where all sample points can be potentially used for nutrients 
recovery, depending on the technology used. However, in all cases, it is important to install a filter 
system in order to reduce the amount of total suspended solids (TSS), which is s critical parameter 
with a negative influence in nutrient recovery performance. 
Several studies have been carried out with the aim to remove and recover nutrients from aqueous 
solutions. Some of them use biological reactors; other use electrochemical technologies such as 
electrocoagulation. Also, in some studies, it was attempted to precipitate phosphate salts, but the 
most studied method in the last years has been sorption or filtration by integrating membrane 
technologies. 
 
1.4.1. Electrochemical 
In electrochemical processes, the direct current field is the driving force where cations and anions 
migrate towards the cathode and anodes, respectively (Xie et al., 2016). Traditionally, 
electrochemical processes reported lack of selectivity towards ions as well as high-energy 
consumption.  
Selectivity towards phosphate and ammonium ions was improved by the integration of ion selective 
monopolar membranes leading to electrodialysis (ED) (Xie et al., 2016; Yan et al., 2018). Moreover, 
energy consumption was reduced by integrating electrochemical to the biological process in order 
to  profit the bioelectricity generated from oxidation of organic compounds (Chen et al., 2017; Kelly 
and He, 2014; Zhang et al., 2014).  
In the ED process, nutrients can be selectively separated from the feed solution obtaining 
phosphate-rich and ammonium-rich solutions in anode and cathode chamber, respectively as is 
shown in Figure 1.5. Concentration factor up to 7 is achieved, and phosphate selectivity could be 
improved by increasing current density or feed solution pH (Tran et al., 2015, 2014).  
 
 
Figure 1.5: Schematic representation of ED-based system for nutrient recovery (Yan et al., 2018) 
 
An increase in the voltage would promote bipolar membrane fouling, mainly in the forms of calcium 
phosphate salt precipitation, which reduces its lifetime (Wang et al., 2011). Experimental results at 
Nutrient recovery from waste water treatment plant by sorption processes: technical and economic analysis

pilot scale showed that the application of a struvite pre-treatment would reduce significantly 
precipitation formation (Ward et al., 2018). Furthermore, higher pH also improves phosphate 
enrichment; it may lead conversion of ammonium ions into volatile ammonia, which decreases the 
ammonium accumulation. 
 
1.4.2. Biological 
On traditional Enhanced Biological Reactors, phosphate content in wastewater is accumulate as 
polyphosphate in aerobic/anoxic environments by phosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), 
resulting in a P-rich sludge (Zhao et al., 2015). However, the recovered product cannot be used 
directly in agriculture as it contains heavy metals, toxic organic micropollutants and pathogens 
(Schoumans et al., 2015). In the case of N, it is recovered as ammonia and stripped via air/N2, 
which is adsorbed to form ammonium salts such as ammonium sulphate or ammonium carbonate 
(Iskander et al., 2016; Kelly and He, 2014; Wu and Modin, 2013). 
Nutrient containing secondary effluent can be also used for microalgae growth, which reports dual 
benefit as it achieves almost a complete removal of N and P and the cultivated biomass can be 
used for biogas and bio-fertilizer production promoting circular economy (Arashiro et al., 2018; 
Arias et al., 2018) and sustainable plant harvesting strategies (Luo et al., 2018).  
Furthermore, microalgae cultures can be converted into bio-char for soil remediation as well as for 
improving agricultural profitability (Arif et al., 2017; Arun et al., 2018; Santos and Pires, 2018; 
Uzoma et al., 2011). It improves soil residual nitrogen and carbon and electrical conductivity 
(Rizwan et al., 2018); as well as crop quality due to microalgae contained vitamins, carotenoids 
and amino acids (Coppens et al., 2016). In addition, bio-char can be also used to mitigate pollution 
and manage the risk of eutrophication, since it shows a good sorption capacities for organic and 
inorganic micro-pollutants (Cao and Harris, 2010; Mohan et al., 2014), retains the N and P 
(Mukherjee et al., 2011) and have the potential to sequestrate CO2 from atmosphere (Lehmann et 
al., 2006). 
 
1.4.3. Membranes Technology 
Studies on phosphorus recovery are mainly focused on concentrated streams although diluted 
effluents, such as treated wastewater, often contains a significant portion of phosphorus mass and 
lower levels of TSS, which may result in less operational issues. Thus, membrane technology is 
useful for concentrate phosphorus in the retentate stream in order to favor the subsequent recovery 
(Nir et al., 2018). Forward osmosis (FO), and membrane distillation (MD) are the main membrane 
technologies for nutrient concentration in wastewater (Xie et al., 2016, 2014). 
FO process is based on a semipermeable membrane which uses the osmotic pressure gradient 
between the feed and the permeate solution as driving force (Yan et al., 2018). It is capable to 
concentrate more than tenfold concentrations of nutrient in the feed solution (Vanotti et al., 2017; 
Xue et al., 2015). 
Chapter 1. Introduction

The pH of the feed solution may influence the nutrient retention in the feed side since the surface 
of the membrane is negatively charged at alkaline pH, which favors the migration of ammonium 
ions to the permeate side and increases  the retention of phosphate ions (Cartinella et al., 2006; 
Xue et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2018).  
The MD process is a thermally driven membrane technology, where the feed solution is heated to 
create the vapor pressure gradient. Normally, phosphate ions are concentrated in the feed solution 
due to the non-volatility while ammonium ions are accumulated in the permeate side by reacting 
with the receiving solution (e.g. HCl or H2SO4) in the form of ammonium salts (Thygesen et al., 
2014; Zarebska et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2013). 
By using membrane technologies, phosphate ions are concentrated in the feed solution which also 
contains Ca2+, Na+ or Mg2+ ions. Therefore, rejected stream can be used for crystallization of Ca-
P and Mg-P minerals, which can be both used as raw material for phosphate acid production or 
directly disposed as local fertilizer (Nir et al., 2018). 
 
1.4.4. Precipitation 
Chemical precipitation and crystallization are generally of high efficiency in the treatment high 
concentrated wastewater effluents of nutrient (Abarca et al., 2017; Ronteltap et al., 2010). As result, 
can be obtained a high purity Hydroxyapatite (HAP) or struvite (MAP), which can be used as slow-
release fertilizer with low heavy metal content compared to phosphate rock (Dai et al., 2017, 2016; 
Tarayre et al., 2016).  
The main operational parameters which affect the formation of P precipitates are pH and molar 
ratio of participating ions (Peng et al., 2018; Ye et al., 2017).  The pH value influences on the 
phosphate concentration, which impacts on crystals average size as well as size diversity. (Le 
Corre et al., 2007; Matynia et al., 2006; Rahman et al., 2014). To improve the effectiveness of 
precipitation, the optimum Ca:P and Mg:NH4:PO4  ratio for HAP and MAP production was set on 
1.67:1 and  1.15:1:1, respectively (Huang et al., 2017a; Shih et al., 2017; Wang and Nancollas, 
2008). 
Mg and Ca materials are usually employed as the precipitators for the formation of MAP and HAP, 
respectively (Yan et al., 2018). However, the product purity is highly dependent of metal sources 
(Huang et al., 2017a; Liu et al., 2016).  
Specific surface area, pore structure, particle size as well as environmental compatibility are key 
parameters to consider for crystallization seeds chose (Duan et al., 2010; Rahaman et al., 2008). 
Many natural seeds as quartz sand (Battistoni et al., 2000), struvite (Yu et al., 2013), calcite (Liu et 
al., 2012; Song et al., 2006), dolomite (Karaca et al., 2006; Yin and Kong, 2014), xonotlite (Chen 
et al., 2009), gastropod shells (Oladoja et al., 2013, 2012) or cow bone (Gu et al., 2015) have been 
assessed due to their abundance in nature, chemical stability, lack of toxicity and good 
biodegradability.  
In addition, some synthetic materials which are byproducts of industrial production such as 
tobermorite rich waste compounds from construction industry (Berg et al., 2006), plant ash (Huang 
Nutrient recovery from waste water treatment plant by sorption processes: technical and economic analysis 
10 
 
et al., 2017b), converter slag (Kim et al., 2006) or synthetic calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) (Guan 
et al., 2014; H. Li et al., 2017; Okano et al., 2016) were also studied in the new circular economy 
schema reporting high efficiency inducting HAP precipitation. 
 
1.4.5. Sorption 
Nutrient recovery by sorption shows advantages such as simple operation and design as well as 
low cost. After sorption, nutrient-loaded sorbent can be desorbed for obtaining phosphate rich 
solution or, in the case of calcium and magnesium based adsorbents, can be used for direct land 
applications (Ye et al., 2017; You et al., 2017). Nutrient sorption mechanisms are mainly based on 
ion exchange, surface complexation and surface precipitation (Ye et al., 2017).  
Natural sorbents, mainly clays (Rahmani et al., 2013), biochar (Takaya et al., 2016) or calcium 
containing shells (Abeynaike et al., 2011) have been assessed for nutrient recovery. As many of 
them reported low selectivity and low sorption capacity, salt modification and pH-based sites 
activation processes were carried out for improving overall adsorption performance. 
Layered Double Hydroxides (LDHs), also named hydrotalcite-like compounds or anionic clays, 
have been widely assessed as adsorbent for phosphate recovery due to its high anion exchange 
capacity and outstanding thermal stability (Chitrakar et al., 2010). However, it reported poor 
selectivity towards phosphate species, which have been improved by altering the interlayer anion 
with organic compounds as pyromellitic acid, benzoic acid, terephtalic acid or trimesic acid (Yu et 
al., 2015); and with metals such as iron (Seida and Nakano, 2002), aluminum (Novillo et al., 2014), 
zirconium or magnesium (Drenkova-Tuhtan et al., 2016).  
Zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals with porous structure which allows water retention 
and high cation exchange-capacity (Ramesh et al., 2011; Sherry, 2003). Application of zeolites as 
low-cost adsorbent for water and wastewater treatment have been widely studied since the last 
years (Tashauoei et al., 2010) due to their significant worldwide occurrence, the possibility to be 
synthesized from fly ash and the well performance reported as slow release fertilizer carrier 
(Ramesh et al., 2010). In addition, zeolites reported availability for improving soil physicochemical 
and microbial capacity (Abdi et al., 2006) as well as for enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus use 
efficiency (Gruener et al., 2003; Hua et al., 2006; McGilloway et al., 2003).  
There is a wide variety of natural zeolites with ammonium adsorption capacity in the range of 2.7 – 
30.6 mg/g, concluding that zeolites in sodium form are those which reports better adsorption 
performance (Wang and Peng, 2010). Zeolites can be treated with salts (Mitrogiannis et al., 2018), 
acids and alkalis in order to improve the adsorption performance though the modification of 
functional cation as well as inner porous structure.  
Loaded zeolites can be desorbed and regenerated by using alkaline solutions and regeneration 
processes reported improvement on NH4+ removal as it increases zeolite’s structure microporosity 
(Zhang et al., 2017). Moreover, loaded di-valent and tri-valent functionalized zeolites, which 
contains P-based salts precipitates could be directly disposed for agricultural uses or soil 
remediation purposes (Mitrogiannis et al., 2018; You et al., 2017).  
Chapter 1. Introduction 
11 
 
Synthetic sorbents, mainly based on functionalized polymeric matrix (O’Neal and Boyer, 2013) and 
metal oxides such (e.g., iron oxide nanotubes (Kim et al., 2016), or layered rare earth hydroxides 
(Jeon et al., 2018), among others) were also widely assessed for nutrient removal and recovery.  
A comparison of nutrient loading capacities for different adsorbents reported in the literature is 
collected in Table 1.2. It can be observed that most synthetic adsorbents resulted in higher capacity. 
Loaded natural sorbents were more suitable to be used directly for soil remediation while synthetic 
sorbents are designed for being capable to be reused for several sorption – desorption working 
cycles and obtaining nutrient rich streams during regeneration.

1.4.6. Integrated systems 
In order to improve the efficiency of WWTPs and their self-sustainability, most of the research has 
focused on integrating nutrient recovery systems into existing facilities instead of finalist 
technologies. Therefore, the aim of many studies and also this PhD. thesis is valorizing nutrients 
contained in WWTPs effluents while minimizing energy consumption and sludge production.  
Enhanced biological nutrient recovery technology can be improved by integrating membranes to 
the bioreactor (Yan et al., 2018) as the membrane can highly reject nutrient and mineral salts which 
favors HAP and MAP precipitation (Zou and Wang, 2016). Furthermore, as nutrients are rejected 
by the membrane, P-rich sludge production is reduced (Qiu et al., 2015; Qiu and Ting, 2014). 
Moreover, precipitation and crystallization processes are combined with biogas production 
(Tervahauta et al., 2014) in order to improve WWTPs energy sustainability. 
Finally, it is worth to note that nutrient removal impacts significantly in WWTPs operational costs 
as the most important factors which determines economics in a WWTP management are the 
chemicals and energy consumption in precipitation and aerobic processes, respectively (Revollar 
et al., 2017; Santín et al., 2017).  
Within this context, integrating nutrients recovery technologies in WWTPs seems to be a feasible 
alternative to conventional nutrients removal schema as it may lead to a reduction of energy and 
chemical consumption, sludge production, valorization of recovered nutrients and promotion of 
circular economy.
