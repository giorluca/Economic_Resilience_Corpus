Economic resilience of the command and control function of cities in Central and
Eastern Europe
ABSTRACT: The authors propose a new approach to the analysis of cities in a time of potential major cri-
sis in a dominant sector consisting of the largest firms generating the command and control function of
a city. This purpose is served by the creation of the Central and Eastern European Economic Centre Index
(CEEECI), which reflects the potential of each studied city and its development and/or fields of economic
specialisation of its largest companies capable of generating regional command and control (C&C) func-
tions of cities. Research has shown that the C&C functions of cities such as Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest
are the most resistant to economic crisis of the dominant sector. More than half of the analysed cities are
economically dominated by the consumer business and transportation and manufacturing sectors.
KEY WORDS: cities, economic resilience, headquarters, regional command and control function, Central
and Eastern Europe
Ekonomska odpornost funkcije vodenja in upravljanja srednje- in vzhodnoevropskih
mest
POVZETEK: Avtorji v članku predlagajo nov pristop k analizi mest med morebitno veliko gospodarsko
krizo vodilnega sektorja, v katerem največje gospodarske družbe opravljajo funkcijo vodenja in uprav-
ljanja mesta. V ta namen avtorji oblikujejo indeks srednje- in vzhodnoevropskih gospodarskih središč, ki
izraža potencial posameznega proučevanega mesta in njegov razvoj in/ali področja gospodarske speciali-
zacije njegovih največjih gospodarskih družb, ki lahko opravljajo regionalno funkcijo vodenja in upravljanja
mest. Raziskava je pokazala, da so funkcije vodenja in upravljanja mest, kot so Varšava, Praga in Budimpešta,
najbolj odporne na gospodarsko krizo vodilnega sektorja. Glavni gospodarski sektorji v več kot polovici
analiziranih mest so sektor izdelkov za široko rabo, prevozništvo in proizvodni sektor.
KLJUČNE BESEDE: mesta, ekonomska odpornost, sedež, regionalna funkcija vodenja in upravljanja, Srednja
in Vzhodna Evropa

1 Introduction
The concept of a command and control function appears in many research publications and descriptions
of the economic strength of cities and their international connectivities. One seminal paper on this sub-
ject is that of Hall (1966) who created the world city concept. Friedmann (1986, 70–77) argues that one
measure of a world city is its control function in the global economy: »…The global control functions of
world cities are directly reflected in the structure and dynamics of their production sectors and employment…«.
He also notes that world cities invite foreign capital (Friedmann 1986, 73) by functioning as open systems,
thus attracting investment and yielding additional command and control functions in the world econo-
my. Sassen (1991) describes New York, London, and Tokyo as the most critical cities in the world economy
due to their accumulation of world economic control functions. Beaverstock, Smith and Taylor (1999)
analysed the international connectivities of cities via the largest companies in the services sector, account-
ing sector, advertising sector, banking sector, and the field of law, but connectivities may also be examined
for other sectors including global media firms, maritime-producer services, and non-governmental
organisations (Derudder and Taylor 2018). It appears at this point in time that New York and London are
the most highly linked cities via what is known as the NY-LON city-dyad concept (Taylor et al. 2014).
Command and Control Function (C&C) is determined on the basis of location of the headquarters of the
main multinational companies. The C&C functions in city research are strongly linked to the notion of
cities as command and control centres of the world economy (Csomós 2013; Csomós and Derudder 2014).
The command and control (C&C) function may also contribute to the prestige of a city (Alderson and
Beckfield 2004). It seems that research on the corporate headquarters of the largest firms shows a partic-
ular strength of cities in terms of their command and control role in the global economy; however, this is
not the only measure of the global rank of a city (Taylor 2004). 
Other studies on the number of corporate headquarters per city and corporate financial results as
factors in the economic strength of cities as well as their impact on other parts of the world include the
following: Heenan (1977), Friedmann and Wolff (1982), Taylor et al. (2009), Huang, Leung and Shen (2013),
Raźniak, Dorocki and Winiarczyk-Raźniak (2018b), Csomós (2017), Derudder et al. (2018), Śleszyński
(2018), Raźniak, Dorocki and Winiarczyk-Raźniak (2019). Since the 1970s transnational corporations have
become increasingly important in the world economy and many have relocated their principal office or
corporate headquarters to new locations in Asia (Csomós and Derudder 2014). This may be due to the
fact that geographical diversification of investments is one of the key issues considered by investors eager
to reduce their level of risk (Bacsosz 2019). It is noteworthy that companies located in Central and Eastern
Europe are starting to play an increasingly significant role in the world economy (Raźniak and Winiarczyk-
Raźniak 2015).
Existing conceptualisations of the city, e.g. world city (Internet 3), global city (Sassen 1991), city com-
mand and control function (Csomós 2013) do not assess the resilience of these functions to periodic crises
in the world economy. While cities may be very important in the world, they may not be ready to counter
economic recession events that may strongly affect a given key function of their economy. It may be argued
that a city characterised by a strong command and control function is not necessarily prepared for a major
crisis event. The command and control function of cities dominated by a single sector or company is prone
to economic collapse in the event that the dominant sector or company faces problems. On the other hand,
the C&C function of cities basing their growth on multiple successful companies or sectors is better able
to offset losses at selected companies or structural problems in some sectors by the successful performance
of other companies or entire sectors of the command and control function (Raźniak, Dorocki and Winiarczyk-
Raźniak 2017). 
Cities are complex, adaptive systems of people, economics, and the natural environment driven by key
processes sustaining them and determining their ability to resist crisis events (Hooling 2001). This means
that a city’s resistability may be defined in terms of the flexibility of its communities and economies, which
are able to predict, prepare for, and respond to disruptions in their functioning (Barnett 2001; Foster 2007). 
We argue that a given city’s command and control function stability can be measured in terms of its
ability to resist economic crisis of the dominant sector represented by leading corporations (Raźniak, Dorocki
and Winiarczyk-Raźniak 2017). This paper assesses this level of resistance to crisis for key economic sec-
tors and key corporate employers in the studied cities. Crisis is defined by the authors in this case as a decline
in the financial performance of firms in a given sector, which causes them to become excluded from the

list of the 500 largest firms in Central and Eastern Europe. This type of decline forces a sector to lose its
dominant economic position and effectively its ability to play a regional command and control role in its
parent city.
In current world economy the increasingly important question is the following: »How will these cities
change when/if these principal functions are lost (Raźniak, Dorocki and Winiarczyk-Raźniak 2017)?« It
is not only important for a city to rank high in a good economic situation, but also in an economic crisis
that may affect its main functions. This prompts the following question: »What will happen to the city com-
mand and control functions in case of economic recession?« The authors use the concept of the city command
and control function to determine the resilience of the cities to possible future economic crises that can
affect a city’s overall rank in the world economy.
2 Research data and methods
The study analyses the largest companies in Eastern Europe and compares their performance over the peri-
od 2008–2015 based on data obtained from the Deloitte company (Internet 1), which has been compiling
sales revenue data on the top 500 companies headquartered in Central and Eastern Europe since 2008.
According to Anh, Thuy and Khanh (2018) an economic crisis may be triggered by a budget deficit,
international currency reserves or increases in national debt. In a purely financial sense, a crisis may be
defined by a depreciation of local currency against the U.S. dollar of at least 30%, and this decline is high-
er than 10 percentage points relative to previous years (Delbianco, Fioriti and Tohmé 2019). Corporate
performance suffers over the course of a financial crisis, as does corporate management quality, with exec-
utives attempting to maximise their own compensation packages at the expense of company financial
performance (Cornett et. al. 2009).
In this research crisis is defined as a decline in financial performance among companies in the most
profitable sector present in a city, which results in a substantial loss of market status of the sector’s com-
panies that generate the command and control function of a city. This type of analysis is served by the creation
of an World Economic Center Index that illustrates the rank of a city in terms of the value of the largest
corporate headquarters by sector as well as the stability of this rank upon sudden removal of the most impor-
tant sector. This index is calculated using basic statistics including standardisation via the standard deviation
value and the weighted average. These methods represent the basis for descriptive statistics and are used
in the calculation of most statistical indices employed in socioeconomic studies (Benos, Karagiannis amd
Karkalakos 2015). This method is designed to produce information on the command and control poten-
tial of a city, but also on its path of economic development or economic specialisation of the companies
creating this function. In addition, it may be assumed that strong company resistance to economic crisis
is linked with a city’s high degree of international connectivity, as financial losses generated by a compa-
ny at one location may be offset by profits generated an another location in the globalised world (Raźniak,
Dorocki and Winiarczyk-Raźniak 2017).
Deloitte’s Central Europe Top 500 List + 50 banking and 50 insurance companies (banking and
insurance companies are in the same reports but not in the main Top 500 list) (Raźniak, Dorocki and
Winiarczyk-Raźniak 2018a) is not representative of the studied region, as it could be affected by a poten-
tial overrepresentation of the banking and insurance sectors. In addition, sales revenue is not the only factor
that describes the rank of a company. In light of this issue, Deloitte Central Europe Top 500 Reports were
used to create a customised list of the most important 500 companies in Central and Eastern Europe. Deloitte
Central Europe Top 500 Report (Internet 2) is based on standardised financial data, and it was used to
create a New Eastern Europe Top 500 list of major companies. Sales revenue was standardised along with
net profit for all 600 Deloitte companies by calculating the share for each individual company where the
maximum relative value is 100. Next, an average value (Equation 1) was calculated for this set of revenue
and profit values (xtop) (Shiller 1991).

where x is the sales revenue and y is the net profit.

The xtop value was used to assign a rank to each company on the list. The first 500 companies were
then selected for further analysis. Further analysis focused on selecting only cities with corporate head-
quarters representing three or more sectors of the economy in any given year.
The studied companies were divided into nine sectors used by Deloitte in its research work (Internet 1):
banking, consumer business and transportation, energy and resources, insurance, life sciences and health
care, manufacturing, the public sector, real estate, technology media and telecommunications. The geo-
graphic location of each company was determined based on the location of its headquarters. Companies
were assigned to specific major metropolitan areas. 
Based on Raźniak, Dorocki and Winiarczyk-Raźniak (2018a) it is assumed that regional as well as local
command and control functions are generated in Eastern European cities by companies on the New Eastern
Europe Top 500 List created by the authors. The benefits of the presence of these companies presumably
go to their parent cities. Based on New Eastern Europe Top 500 List Central and Eastern European Economic
Center Index (CEEECI) was created, which assesses cities in terms of the value of corporate headquarters
by sector and stability in cases where one or more sectors are excluded. This approach yields information
not only on the potential of a given city, but also on its economic evolution and/or specialisation. Cities
with at least three economic sectors were included in the analysis. Cities featuring only two sectors were
excluded in light of the substantial decline of the command and control function in the event of crisis in
one of the sectors. 
The rank of the studied cities was compared by calculating standardised values based on mean nor-
malised revenue and net profit (x) for each studied sector of the economy (z) in the calculation of the
comprehensive potential index (CPI) for each studied city (Equations 2 and 3): 
(2)
(3)
where x = revenue plus net profit for each sector of the economy, s – is the sectors of the economy and N –
is the number of cities per sector of the economy.
One goal of the research was to verify which sector of the economy impacts a city’s economic poten-
tial the most. This purpose was served by subtracting the value of individual sectors from the total
standardised value calculated for 2009, 2012 and 2015. The objective was to observe how the sum of stan-
dardised values (z’) changes for a given city, assuming that the initial value constitutes 100% (Equation 4).
Cities characterised by a high range following sector subtraction tend to specialise in one area of the econ-
omy and tend to remain underdeveloped in other areas of the economy. On the other hand, cities with
low range tend to have both, advanced and multifaceted economies. The paper analyses cities with three
or more sectors. 
(4)
Then a stability index (SI; Equation 5) was constructed using standardised values CPI and variances
in values resulting from the subtraction of the selected individual sectors of the economy (z’) from all stud-
ied sectors. The value of the index was then divided by the standard deviation (SD) of values resulting from
the subtraction of selected sectors (z’) [4]. This index also illustrates how financial crisis in a city’s main
economic sector impacts the city’s overall economy. 
(5)
The final step consisted of the construction of a Comprehensive Development Index for cities based
on sectors (CEEECI). The index includes the degree of stability, number of sectors, and the number of
corporate headquarters (Equation 6). The weights of the variables used to construct the CEEECI were cal-
culated using principal component analysis (PCA), which included the stability index (SI), number of sectors

of the economy (S) and the number of headquarters (HQ). Data for 2008, 2012 and 2015 were analysed
separately and the value of the CEEECI was calculated only based on the first principal component. 
(6)
where HQ is the number of headquarters, S is the number of sectors of the economy and SI is the stability index.
Calculations cannot be performed for a mean sector value of zero. Normalisation was performed only
in relation to a normal distribution without checking for data asymmetry and assuming that a normal dis-
tribution will suffice. This must be considered in data analysis and normalisation must not be used for
data that is strongly skewed.
Similar methods of constructing economic indicators with the use of standardized values, weighted aver-
ages, principal component analysis, and mixed models were discussed by Morrison (1967), and Marino and
Tebala (2016). However, the method used in this paper was created by its authors, and it is used also by the
authors of other publications (Dorocki, Raźniak and Winiarczyk-Raźniak 2018 and 2019; Raźniak et al. 2019).
3 Ranking of Eastern European cities based on the CEEECI
A total of 500 companies had their headquarters in 125 cities in 2008, 124 in 2012, and 156 in 2015. The
number of cities declined by one (–0.8%) during the global economic crisis in 2008. A significant diver-
sification of headquarters locations was noted in the period 2012–2015, and the number of cities increased
25.8%. An opposite trend was observed in the case of the location of the largest world corporations (Internet 2).
60-1_acta49-1.qxd  1.6.2020  7:20  Page 100
The number of cities with the largest corporations increased 7.9% in the period 2008–2012 and then declined
5.4% in the period 2012–2015. Hence, a spatial deconcentration is observed for the largest corporations
in Central and Eastern Europe, while a spatial concentration is observed on a world scale. 
The highest CEEECI values in 2008 were noted for Warsaw (4.7 points), Budapest (2.5 points), and
Prague (2.4 points; Figure 1). Warsaw had the highest CEEECI in subsequent years. Resistance to crisis
in the main sector of Budapest’s economy declined in 2012 and 2015 leading to a decline to third rank,
behind Prague. Other capitals were also characterised by rather high CEEECI values in 2015: Bratislava
(1.99), Bucharest (1.94), Ljubljana (1.46). On the other hand, Kiev’s resistance to crisis significantly declined.
The reason for this may be the current state of war between Russia and Ukraine, influencing the econo-
my (Charap and Colton 2017; Feklyunina and Romanova 2017).
Its CEEECI in 2008 was 1.42, while in 2015 it was almost 40% less. The lowest values (less than 0.5)
for CEEECI cities in the study period were those of Pardubice, Brasov, and Tallinn. The largest increases
were observed for smaller cities such as Łódź (240%), Novo Mesto (189%), Poznań (176%), Pardubice (158%),
and Kraków (153%). However, only Poznań exceeded a value of one in 2015. Several cities were classified
as CEEECI cities in one or two years of the study period: Riga, Wrocław, Sofia in 2008 and 2012; Donetsk,
Ostrava, Pardubice, Dnepropetrovsk in 2012. It may be argued that these cities were not affected by the
global economic crisis of 2008, as they had lost their rank after 2012 (Figure 1).
In 2015 a total of 18 Central and Eastern European economic centres were identified and divided into
four categories based on their ability to resist an economic crisis. Three cities were given the top CEEECI
ranking. Six cities were ranked major. Seven cities were ranked midsize. Two cities were ranked minor.
The Romania and Slovenia feature two cities each. Another seven countries in Eastern Europe feature only
one top-ranked economic centre each. Finally, no ranked economic centres were noted in Albania, Bosnia

and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Moldova, Northern Macedonia, and Serbia (Figure 2). All of the above six
countries are characterised by small geographic area, small population, low total GDP, and low GDP per
capita (Internet 2). Most of these countries became independent only in the 1990s following the dissolu-
tion of the much larger Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest are now
the three most significant Central and Eastern European Economic Centres, and are classified in the top
category due to their economic dominance in the region and very strong resistance to economic crisis. At
the same time, only Prague is home to all nine of the studied sectors (Warsaw and Budapest are home to
eight). These three top CEEECI cities differ in terms of their dominant economic sector. In Warsaw, it
is consumer business and transportation, while in Prague energy and resources, and lastly in Budapest
it is manufacturing. Cities such as Bratislava, Bucharest, Ljubljana, Zagreb, Poznań and the Katowice were
classified in the major category due to their strong ability to resist economic crisis (Figure 2). The only
non-capitals in this group (Poznań and Katowice) are located in Poland, but they are »balanced« regional
centres (Páthy 2017). The region continues to develop in an economic sense as well as in the sense of its
residents’ well-being (Egri and Tánczos 2018) and home to a number of robust foreign corporations (Nazarczuk
and Umiński 2018).
However, each of the three cities is dominated by a different sector of the economy except Zagreb and
Poznań (consumer business and transportation). Hence, it may be argued that the rank of these six cities
may change in different directions in the event of crisis in a particular sector. The strength of Polish cities
(7 cities) is apparent in this study, with 38.9% of CEEECI cities located in Poland. Polish cities are not strong-
ly differentiated by main sector and are classified mostly as major and medium type. Three Polish cities
are dominated by the life sciences and another three are dominated by consumer business and transportation.
Cities described as minor-type usually feature three or four sectors. In the event of crisis in a dominant
sector, midsize-type cities are likely to decline substantially in economic terms (Figure 2). 
The most frequently encountered sector in Central and Eastern European economic centres is the con-
sumer business and transportation sector – eight cities (44.4%). This is especially the case in countries that
used to be part of the Soviet Union until the early 1990s including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Ukraine.
Manufacturing is dominant (22.2%) in four key urban regions – usually old industrial regions such as the
Tri-city (Gdańsk, Gdynia and Sopot) and Łódź in Poland. However, Eastern European companies in this
sector are not important players on the global scene (Krätke 2014). In summary, Central and Eastern European
Economic Centres are dominated by consumer business, transportation, and manufacturing (66,7%). The
next key sector is banking (3 cities; Figure 2).
4 Discussion
The largest companies in Central and Eastern Europe became concentrated in a larger number of cities
in the period 2008–2015 (Internet 1). This is the opposite trend to what is now observed in the world econ-
omy, with fewer cities hosting the largest corporations around the world (Internet 2). This may be the result
of the opening of some offices of foreign corporations headquartered in Eastern Europe in order to limit
operating costs and invest more profits in the home country. What is important is that this occurred sev-
eral years after the global economic crisis of 2008.
Economic stability of the command and control function of cities in time of crisis was analysed in terms
of the effects of structural change on the economy. The smallest differences in the level of economic devel-
opment based on sector specialisation and corporate financial performance were noted in Prague,
Warsaw, Ljubljana, Vilnius, Zagreb, and Poland’s Tri-city. However, the latter four cities were characterised
by low standardised values, which is why the difference in values triggered by the loss of a major sector
of the economy was quite small. A high degree of specialisation and a close link with a single sector were
observed in the case of Donetsk, Bucharest, Kiev, and Bratislava. 
Two thirds of the analysed cities are economically dominated by consumer business and transporta-
tion and manufacturing. A crisis in any of these key sectors could trigger a decline in the city command
and control function. Consequently, the cities of Warsaw, Prague, and Budapest may be called the lead-
ing Central and Eastern European Economic Centres. The three cities are highly resistant to crisis and have
significant international connectivities. At the same time, these three cities possess an adequate amount
102
60-1_acta49-1.qxd  25.5.2020  7:55  Page 102
of potential to play a meaningful role in the world economy. However, Prague outpaced Budapest in 2012
and 2015 compared with 2008.
Given the political history of Central and Eastern Europe and its links to globalisation, it remains a unique
region where many companies operating in this part of the world are in fact just regional offices of lead-
ing corporations. Śleszyński (2015) argues that strategic decisions regarding their key functions are made
outside of Central and Eastern Europe, and argues that the largest companies, even those whose head-
quarters are located in a foreign country, may generate the command and control functions of a given country’s
economy. 
Despite being listed in the Deloitte Central Europe Top 500 Report, many companies in the study area
do not fully perform the command and control function in their home cities. However, regional offices
located in the Central and Eastern Europe may have some decision power at the local and regional level.
Regional managers thus may perform a limited regional or local command and control function, but not
higher-level functions that remain reserved for main offices located outside of the study area. For exam-
ple, the decision to close a plant or regional office made outside of the studied region may strongly affect
the stability of a city’s regional command and control function. Hence, it is important to study cities not only
in terms of the financial results of key corporations, but also in terms of the ability of the command and con-
trol function to remain stable in times of economic crisis in a principal sector generating this function.
It may be argued that, for a city, important is not only the magnitude of the C&C function, but also
its ability to weather a crisis. This is important, as the economy of a city and its C&C function are not only
affected by economic processes, but also by historial problems and ongoing warfare in some cases. 
5 Conclusion
In a global world, it appears that a city’s global rank in a period of economic growth is not the only impor-
tant issue. What is also important is its global rank in periods of economic recession, which may affect its
primary functions. The methodology presented in the paper answers the following question: »What would
happen if something goes wrong in the realm of a city’s C&C function?« Similar research needs to be per-
formed as part of other urban conceptual models such as the concept of the world city. Standard forecasts
are not sufficient (Neal, Derudder and Taylor 2019); instead what is needed is analysis on what would hap-
pen to intercity connectivities in the event that the number of linkages between a given city and its main
connectivity partner city would strongly decrease. Would it continue to be connected as well as before?
Would it continue to be a world city? 
Research has shown that cities can resist economic crisis in their command and control function bet-
ter if they are home to a larger number of economic sectors and follow a more sustainable path of economic
development. In order to increase the attractiveness of a city to global investors, it would be helpful to help
streamline city management practices by reducing redundancies between local governments and the nation-
al government, and increasing the effectiveness of the local job market. These steps would reduce
differences between cities (Wolman et al. 1992) and may also help cities weather any potential crisis that
may occur. Alderson and Beckfield (2004) speak of a certain type of prestige associated with a city’s com-
mand and control function. Cities in the studied region could attempt to build their brand as cities performing
a regional command and control function resistant to economic crisis in a main sector of their local econ-
omy. A strong local or regional brand would then help them to trigger a virtuous cycle of brand recognition
and continuous foreign direct investment.
