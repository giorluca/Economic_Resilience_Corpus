Abstract
The study provides a framework to develop economic resilience
index for West Virginia counties based on the premise that county
economic resilience depends on its physical and human resources,
structure and diversity of its economic base (employment and in-
come diversity), entrepreneurial activity and business dynamics and
scale and proximity (spatial issues). Using 17 indicators along four
of the six proposed dimensions, a preliminary economic resilience in-
dex has been created for West Virginia counties between for the years
2000 and 2005. Geospatial maps are also developed to explore the
evolution of the geographical patterns of economic resilience across
time. The effectiveness of the index is further affirmed in correlation
analyses where the contribution of economic resilience to unemploy-
ment reduction and employment growth is highly significant. These
preliminary results are encouraging and appear to be pointing in a
useful direction. The discussion in this study can serve as a start-
ing point for building a broad-based, standardized, and consistent
definition and measure of economic resilience.

1 Introduction
Globalization, rapid technological change, deep recessions, and man-made
and natural disasters have generated interest in regional economic re-
silience as an important field of study. The economic impact of these
exogenous shocks and the recovery mechanisms differ from region to re-
gion. Lack of economic diversification is one of the major weaknesses that
limits the ability of a region to absorb an external shock. In rural West
Virginia, an over-dependence on the coal and steel industry has shattered
the economies of many counties in the South and Northern panhandle of
the state.
McDowell County is a good example of a county that is struggling to
recover from economic and natural disasters. Once a leading producer of
coal in the US, it is hard hit by change in technology in coal production, de-
cline in industry demand (starting in the 1950s), and flooding (2001-2002).
In the 1950s the county population was close to 100,000 (West Virginia
Health Statistics Center, 2002) and in 1980, 68.9% of its industrial earnings
and 48% of it employment were dependent on coal1. With technological
changes in the coal industry everything started to fall apart. The use of
new mining technologies, competition and demand decline from the steel
industry resulted in the restructuring of the mining industry and a decrease
in the mining labor force. Its population decreased to an estimated 25,000
in 2005. In a quarter of a century (1980-2005) alone, it lost more than 50%
of its population and 63.5% of its employment. McDowell County was
not able to absorb the external shock and bounce back to transform and
diversify its economy and is lagging behind in almost every measure of
economic activity. McDowell is an example of many rural counties whose
economic resilience and the survival of the community are challenged by
economic downturns and disasters. Local stakeholders stand to benefit
from a better understanding of the impact of external shocks on their local
areas that help them improve response strategies that will minimize ad-
verse effects while at the same time building a more resilient economy and
community.
1Most of the population, employment, and earnings data used in the McDowell county
example are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

The literature in this subarea of regional economics is at still in its in-
fancy. However, the closely related issue of the relationship between eco-
nomic instability and diversification has been the subject of many studies.
In theory, economic diversity results in a more stable economy (Akpadock,
1996; Jackson, 1984). The broader concept of community resilience is also
getting much more attention due to the threat of and concerns for man-
made and natural disasters. Economic resilience is one dimension of this
broader concept of community and regional resilience.
The main objective of this study is to develop a county economic re-
silience index for measuring the ability of local economies to withstand
external shocks and bounce back. It can serve as a standalone measure
of economic resilience in relation to economic downturn or it can be used
more generally as one measure of community or regional resilience. It is
one aspect of the community resilience that includes both social and nat-
ural capital of the community. The index highlights and identifies which
geographical areas are best positioned to cope with economic downturns
and those that are at risk. The index also gives a measurement that reflects
the multidimensionality of economic resilience. It provides a framework
for identifying the areas of greatest strength and weakness, with a focus
on the physical and human resources, structure and diversity of the eco-
nomic base (employment and income diversity), entrepreneurial activity
and business dynamics and scale and proximity (spatial issues). The study
is also expected to contribute to our understanding of the geography of
economic resilience and its implication for rural economic development.
A geospatial map is used to assess the spatial distribution of economic
resilience over time.
The index created in this study is not without limitations. Average
county-level data masks many important details that could highlight the
differences in economic resilience within a county. The lack of a consistent
county level database limits the ability to create a broad based index. The
variables included to create the index may not provide a complete picture
of economic resilience of West Virginia counties. However, the index can
serve as a foundation for discussion for understanding economic resilience
and standardizing its measurement. It will also provide a benchmark for
comparing the strengths and weaknesses of West Virginia counties.

2 Defining Economic Resilience
Detailed descriptions and definitions of the resilience concept used in dif-
ferent disciplines are given by Mayunga (2007); Norris et al. (2008); Rose
(2009). Despite the many definitions, it appears that there is some con-
sensus among researchers and practitioners on common attributes of re-
silience. Regional or community resilience is defined “as the ability of a
region to anticipate, prepare for, respond to and recover from a distur-
bance” (Foster, 2007; Mayunga, 2007) while Peacock (2009) defines it “as
the ability of a community to absorb, deflect or resist disaster impacts,
bounce back after being impacted, and learn from experience and modify
its behavior and structure to adapt to future threats”.
Economic resilience to disasters is defined as the inherent and adaptive
responses to hazards that enable individuals and communities to avoid
some potential losses (Rose, 2004). Rose describes static economic re-
silience as the ability or capacity of a system to absorb or cushion against
damage or loss and dynamic resilience as the ability of a system to recover
from a severe shock. Following the literature, in this study economic re-
silience is defined as the ability to absorb shock and bounce back. In this
study, bouncing back is defined as returning to the economic status before
the external shock. While there is some discussion surrounding the de-
sirability of returning to previous economic status rather than some new
normal, and potentially better economic status, setting the target for the
index at complete return establishes a foundational point of reference that
is useful for interregional comparison. The index will provide a base line
where local authorities and policy makers can gauge their region. It will
serve to identify the key factors underlying economic resilience at county
level.
3 Literature
Economic resilience is a highly complex construct which is affected by sev-
eral factors. Disaster and economic downturns are the two main factors
that test the resiliency of a region. There are several frameworks which
focus on economic resilience (Briguglio et al., 2009; Rose, 2007; EDAW and
5/21
AECOM, 2009; Arnold et al., 2009). Although these conceptual frame-
works have advanced our understanding, in the case of the US, they have
not led to an index that could have a practical application at the local level.
Several approaches are used to measure the economic resilience of a
region. Computational general equilibrium (CGE) modeling (Rose and
Liao, 2005), case studies (Foster, 2007), discriminant analysis (Chapple and
Lester, 2007), and an entropy index of industrial diversification (Horne
et al., 1999) are some of the approaches that have been used to study re-
gional economic resilience in the US. Horne et al. (1999) equate economic
resilience to industrial diversification and assumed that greater diversity
of the industrial base leads to more resilient economies. This implies that
a county with a diversified industrial base is more resilient than an indus-
trial concentrated one. This seems intuitive but warrants some caution. A
region with a diversified economy might lack strong capabilities to bounce
back after shock (Lanza et al., 2010), perhaps because it fails to incorporate
the role of human and physical capital in economic resilience.
Resilience measures the capacity of the community impacted by an
external shock to adjust and recover quickly. The stronger the social, eco-
nomic, and environmental capital, the more resources community has from
which to draw for recovery. Small rural communities may not have the
necessary resources to deal with major disasters or economic downturns,
but they may have a very strong sense of community. How much strong
social capital can compensate the lack of resources and help communities
to recover is an issue by itself worth investigating. The presence or absence
of existence of separate small communities (ethnic, race, economic) within
a larger jurisdiction was found to be important in community resilience in
areas of Mississippi and Louisiana affected by Katrina (Li et al., 2014). The
scale of the economy and the proximity of the region to major urban, trans-
portation, and communication centers could also play a role in fostering
economic resilience.

4 Methodology
The County Economic Resilience Index (CERI) builds on past research and
analysis that used economic resilience indicators as one dimension in com-
munity resilience and/ or social vulnerability index (Cutter et al., 2003, 2008,
2009; Peacock, 2009; EDAW and AECOM, 2009). The approach is based on
the assumption that economic resilience is a complex phenomenon which
cannot be explained by one single attribute but multiple attributes of a
region can be combined to create a single, composite index value. Fig-
ure 1 and Table 1 shows the proposed framework. The County Economic
Resilience Index (CERI) proposed in this study has six dimensions: indus-
trial diversity, entrepreneurial activity and business dynamics, human and
social capital, scale and proximity, and physical capital (infrastructure).
Figure 1: Proposed Framework for County Economic Resilience Index
(CERI)
4.1 Industrial Diversity
Regional economic resilience to large extent depends on the industrial base
of its underlying economy. A highly concentrated economic base can give
a competitive advantage due to specialization and can be a major source
of economic growth. It can also expose the region to external shocks due
to over-dependence on particular activities. This can lead to localized job
losses if global trends result in outsourcing or demand change. A balance
7/21
between diversification and specialization is needed in order to stay com-
petitive but also minimize the exposure to external shocks. To construct
a measure of industrial diversity, an index is developed by aggregating
industrial employment into ten sectors2. The computation of the index is
based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Quarterly Cen-
sus of Employment and Wages. Following Attaran and Zwick (1989) and
Nissan and Carter (2006) an Entropy Index (E) of industrial diversity is
created as follows:
E =
n∑
i=0
Pi × log
1
Pi
(1)
Where n is the number of sectors and Pi is the percentage of employment
in each sector from total private employment. The greater the value E the
more diversified will be the industrial base.
4.2 Income Diversity (INCD)
In social sciences, income diversity often is related to the measures of
income distribution that try to show income inequality and its effect to
economic development. This is a very important measure of the overall
wellbeing of the community. But for economic resilience, sources of in-
come are equally important. The measure used in this study will capture
the source of income and the distribution of the income in the region.
The objective here is to assess the role of income diversity in absorbing
shocks and bouncing back. First an entropy index of income sources using
the same formula as in the industrial diversity index will be created by
summing up the different sources of income as percentages of per capita
income. This index will be added to the Gini coefficient of income inequal-
ity to form the index of income diversity. The indicators used to measure
the sources of income diversity are:
1. Percentage of wage and salaries (labor income) from total per capita
income
2The super sectors are natural resource s and mining, construction, manufacturing,
trade, transportation, and utilities, information, financial services, professional and busi-
ness services, leisure and hospitality, and other services.
8/21
2. Percentage of investment income from total per capita income
3. Percentage of self employment income from total per capita income
4. Percentage of transfer payment income from total per capita income
INCD =
n∑
i=0
Pi × log
1
Pi
+ Gini (2)
Where Pi is the percentages of the different sources of income from per
capita income and Gini is the Gini coefficient of income inequality.
4.3 Entrepreneurial Activity and Business Dynamics
This dimension captures the extent of self-employment, the number of
patents, and establishment churn as a proxy measure of the entrepreneurial
activity and business dynamics. A region that scores high in this dimension
possesses the flexibility and attitude that might allow its economy to adjust
rapidly to changing economic conditions.
1. Self Employment: % of Number of nonfarm proprietors from total
employment
2. Establishment churn: It is defined as the total establishment Births,
Deaths, Expansions, and contractions, relative to the total number of
firms in county j.
Establishment Churn j =
Births + Deaths + Expansion + Constraction
Deaths + Expansions + Constraction + Constants
(3)
Where Births is the establishment births in year t, Deaths is establish-
ment deaths in year t, Expansion is establishment expansions in year
t, Contraction is establishment contractions in year t, and Constants is
9/21
establishment constants in year t. Establishment Births, Deaths, Ex-
pansions, Contractions, and Constants are determined by the change
in establishment employment between the initial and subsequent
years.
3. Number of patents: the number of patents in a county is used as a
proxy for a measure of innovation.
4.4 Scale and Proximity
Local economies do not exist in isolation. They affect and are affected by
the economic activities in the region. In West Virginia, this is more apparent
in the Eastern and Northern panhandle. Counties in the Eastern panhan-
dle benefit from the proximity and agglomeration of the Washington DC
metro area. On the other hand, the economies in the Northern panhandle
are part of the Rust Belt and are related to the Pittsburgh metro area. The
downturn of the manufacturing sector in the region is one of the reasons
that affected the economies of the counties in the Northern panhandle of
the state.
The scale and proximity dimension captures the agglomeration ef-
fects associated with larger economies. It identifies the level of inter-
connectivity between neighboring urban economies and reflects the impor-
tance of size to economic resilience. Higher levels of integration provide
additional opportunities to business and the workforce, while more self
contained or isolated economies are dependent upon local opportunities.
There are three indicators within this domain:
1. Establishment or business density is the number of businesses for
1000 employee
2. Population Density reflects the scale of the local economy and is
measured as population per square mile
3. Average distance and time of work to commute captures both the
opportunities and willingness of local people to access employment
opportunities beyond the city boundaries.
10/21
4.5 Human Capital
Higher levels of human capital in a community are expected to increase
resiliency by enhancing innovative and productive activities. Human cap-
ital also helps regions develop the ability to anticipate, cope, adapt, and
recover from disasters and downturns. Educational attainment is the com-
monly used measure of human capital (reference here would be good). The
percentage of creative class employment relative to over employment is
used as proxy to the quality and creativity of the work force. The variables
used in this dimension are:
1. Education for persons 25 and over with bachelor’s degree or higher
2. Education of persons 25 and over with some college level or an
associate’s degree
3. Percentage of creative class employment relative to over employment
4.6 Physical Capital
The strength of economic activity in a region depends on the physical in-
frastructure in the region. These regional assets facilitate communication
and transportation that are vital in sustaining a competitive advantage.
These include physical assets and other advantages from location. Physi-
cal capital refers to the built environment of buildings roads and bridges;
and utilities. The three indicators that are used as proxies to physical cap-
ital are:
1. Housing stock
2. Road and highway density
3. Access to health care providers
4.7 The Composite Index
Several approaches are available to create the composite index of County
Economic Resilience. One approach is to use a three step process.
11/21
1. Convert raw data of each indicator to a ratio by dividing the county
level data by the West Virginia state level average
2. Standardize all indicators using xi−xMinxMax−xMin to a measure between 0-1
3. Create sub-indices by summing the standardized indicators
4. Give weight (W) to each sub-indices or dimension (D)
5. Sum the weighted averages for each county j
CERI j =
n∑
i=0
Wi ×Di
The second approach is to use principal component analysis (PCA). In
this approach all the individual indicators will be included in the PCA
and the components with eigenvalues greater than one will be summed
together to form the composite index.
5 Data Sources
The County Economic Resilience Index is created using data which is pub-
licly available from official government statistical agencies. The Bureau of
Economic Analysis (BEA), US Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics
(BLS), and West Virginia Work Labor Market Information are some of the
data sources used to create the database for the study. One of the major
problems was finding consistent time series data for all indicators. Some
of the census variables are available only on decennial bases. In such cases,
the closest census year data is used. For example, for all cases during the
period of 1995-2005, the decennial Census of 2000 is used and for cases of
1985-1995, the decennial Census of 1990 is used.

6 Preliminary Results of the County Economic
Resilience Index (CERI)
The composite CERI contains four dimensions: industrial diversity, hu-
man capital, entrepreneurial activity and business dynamics, and scale
and proximity. Each of the dimensions is a sub-index by itself and is cre-
ated from multiple variables. The preliminary CERI for 2000 and 2005
are created from 17 variables. Industrial diversity is constructed as index
of employment rate in 10 sectors; human capital consists of percentage
of population with college degrees, some college degrees, and creative
class; entrepreneurial activity and business dynamics includes establish-
ment Churn and percentage of self employment; and scale and proximity
is formed from population density and establishment density.
A four step approach: converting the county raw data to a relative
measure by dividing the county level data by the West Virginia state level
average; standardizing using xi−xMinxMax−xMin to a measure between 0-1; creating
sub-indices of the four dimensions by summing the standardized indica-
tors; and finally summing the dimensions to create CERI. Equal weight is
given to each variable in the sub-indices and each dimension in the com-
posite index.
Table 2 presents the CERI by quartile for West Virginia counties. The
counties in each quartile are listed from the highest to the lowest. Figure
1 also provides the spatial distribution of the quartiles in 2000 and 2005.
CERI is highly correlated with the degree of urbanization of the counties.
The correlation between the CERI 2000 and 2005 with the Index of Relative
Rurality (IRR)3 is −0.65 and −0.61 respectively. This makes sense because
as the level of urbanization increases, counties are expected to be stronger
economically.
3The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR) is created by Brigitte Waldorf, professor with the
Department of Agricultural Economics at Purdue University. It is used to determine a
county’s degree of rurality based on four dimensions of rurality: population, population
density, extent of urbanized area, and the distance to the nearest metro area. The index
is based on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being the most urban place and 1 being the most
rural place. According to this index rural counties are defined as counties with the 0.4 or
greater in the index (Waldorf, 2006).

Figure 3 and table 3 present the spatial distribution of CERI based on
the deviation of the index from the mean. It highlights which counties are
in the top and bottom of the list. There are eight counties that score one
standard deviation above the state mean of 3.03 and seven counties below
it (Table 3). The rest 40 counties are within one standard deviation of the
mean. According to this preliminary index, the counties that scored high
are part of a metro area with a major city, close to interstate highway, and
high in human capital.

Jefferson and Marion are the two counties considered rural (according
to IRR) that scored one standard deviation above the mean in the index in
2000 and 2005 (Table 3). Jefferson County is part of the Washington D.C.
metropolitan area and it is hard to consider it rural. Marion County is
center of the Fairmont Micropolitan Statistical Area and is adjacent to the
Morgantown Metropolitan region. In both cases the economy of the coun-
ties has benefited from its proximity to major urban centers. However, this
17/21
is not true in the case of the counties that scored low. Some of the counties
included in this group are physically adjacent to metro areas and their
economies are not benefiting from any spillover effect from its geographic
proximity to urban centers. Even though, a detailed study is needed to
understand what is going in these counties, one possible explanation could
be the level of accessibility or connectivity with the urban centers.
We test the performance of the index in relation to the unemployment
rate of 2002. The correlation of CERI of 2000 with the unemployment rate
in 2002 was −0.48 and was highly significant at the one percent level. This
indicates that counties that scored high in the index on average have low
unemployment rate in the recession of 2001-2002. Is this an indication of
absorbing the economic shocks and dislocations of the previous decades?
7 Conclusion
The differential performance of U.S. regions in face of the most recent eco-
nomic downturn signifies the necessity of understanding the composition
and determinants of economic resilience. By adopting a working definition
of economic resilience as the ability to absorb shock and bounce back, this
study proposed a framework to create a county level index of economic re-
silience. Our main objective at this stage is to initiate a discussion that can
contribute to the conceptualization and validation of a consistent measure
of county economic resilience in the U.S. context.
Drawing on previous literature that concentrates on social vulnerabil-
ity and disaster resilience, this paper first identifies the research gap in
defining and measuring economic resilience and addresses this gap by
formulating new concepts and measures that suit the U.S. situation. Next,
by choosing 17 indicators along four of the six proposed dimensions, a
preliminary economic resilience index has been created and implanted for
West Virginia counties between the years 2000 and 2005. Geospatial maps
are also developed to explore the evolution of the geographical patterns of
economic resilience across time. The index is found to be consistent with
the ARC classification of economic status, i.e. competitive, transitional,
and distressed, for West Virginia counties. The majority of the counties
18/21
that scored low in the economic resilience index are classified as distressed
by ARC. The effectiveness of the index is further affirmed in subsequent
correlation analyses where the contribution of economic resilience to un-
employment reduction and employment growth is highly significant.
These preliminary results are encouraging and appear to be pointing
in a useful direction. The discussion in this study can serve as a starting
point for building a broad-based, standardized, and consistent definition
and measure of economic.
