ABSTRACT: The aim of this article is to examine and compare the perceptions and effects of the economic 
crisis on Greek women and men, as well as their resilience actions. Specifically, in this paper, we compare 
men’s and women’s perceptions of the economic crisis; secondly, in order to determine the extent of its 
effect on gender, we consider employment as a key variable, and investigate if and how employment 
differentiation leads to inequalities between men and women and among women themselves. Finally, we 
investigate gender resilience to adversity (actions) at both the personal (e.g., everyday behaviour), and the 
organisational level (e.g. membership in organisations and political participation). Based on data derived 
from the LIVEWHAT project, the results demonstrate that both men and women have been affected by the 
economic crisis and have sustained significant losses. Nevertheless, our data show that, among women, it 
is those in the lower occupational categories who have withstood more severe losses in employment and 
working conditions. Resilient to adversities, both men and women, albeit in different ways, adjust, 
accommodate and resist hardships through personal actions, networking and political actions. Our study 
finally points to the need for the inclusion of gender in any analysis of the impact of crises, as well as in the 
methods, ways and resources mobilised for resilience.

1. Introduction 
 
Greece is going through the eighth year (2010-2017) of its economic crisis. During 
this extended period, the austerity measures imposed by the lending institutions 
(IMF/EU /ECB)1, and adopted by the Greek State, have had a detrimental impact on 
multiple aspects of the socioeconomic and the personal lives of a large number of 
individuals and groups. Unprecedented in severity, volume and extent, these measures 
imposed limitations on socioeconomic rights and opportunities, caused significant 
problems on people’s everyday lives and compromised long-term prospects. 
Additionally, public expenditure cuts (e.g., in health and family care services, social 
benefits, housing, education, etc.) disproportionately impacted low-income and 
unemployment-stricken households, single-parent families, as well as other vulnerable 
social groups (Zambarloukou 2015).  
Employment statistics are indicative of the situation. The unemployment rate for all 
working/occupational groups skyrocketed, from 9.6% in 2009, to 27.5% by 2013 and 
slightly declined to 23.6% in 2016 (EUROSTAT 2017)2. Part time jobs, of 6-7 or even 8 
hours, usually without overtime compensation, became the dominant mode of 
employment; more so for women, who constitute 60.51% of part-time workers (GSGE, 
Gender Equality Observatory 2016)3. Despite unemployment being widespread, it 
varies, depending on demographic characteristics such as age and gender. One 
example is high unemployment rates among young people (reaching 74% in October 
2016) (ELSTAT 2017)4, which resulted in many young professionals seeking 
employment outside the country (Bank of Greece 2016)5. On the other hand, in 1995, 
women constituted 38.1% of the workforce, compared to 47.4% in 2006. In 2013, at 
the peak of the economic crisis, women’s workforce participation plummeted to 
28.45% (ELSTAT 2017)6. In 2016, Greek women’s unemployment rate rose to 31.4%,

5According to the Bank of Greece’s Report (2017) from 2008 to 2015 the total number of Greeks who 
sought employment abroad in the 15 to 64-year age range surpassed 427,000; while 223,000 young 
people between the ages of 25-39 were college graduates. .

much higher than the EU average of 10.2%, whereas the unemployment rate among 
women, ages 15 to 29, climbed to 57.5% (ELSTAT 2017)7. These rates might have been 
even higher if it wasn’t for the high percentage (47%) of women employed directly by 
the State or some of its auxiliary agencies (Hellenic Ministry of the Interior and 
Administrative Reconstruction 2017)8.  
However, additional burdens are also experienced by women because of the 
economic crisis. Significant cuts have been imposed on social and health-care benefits 
and gender equality policies, such as maternity leave and assistance, benefits for 
families with multiple and/or disabled children, childcare services, etc., which hitherto 
alleviated (primarily) women’s economic burdens and facilitated their workforce 
participation (Zambarloukou 2015). These cuts and reductions have further negative 
implications, as evident from the poverty rate: men’s poverty rate increased from 
29.6% in 2011 to 34.6% in 2013, while among women, it rose from 32.3% to 36.8% 
respectively (Lyberaki and Tinios 2016, 61).  
The protracted economic crisis has affected the personal and the socioeconomic 
lives of people in many ways, including reversing women’s workforce participation 
gains and enhancing the vulnerability of specific social groups (Papageorgiou 2015; 
forthcoming). Nevertheless, both individually and collectively, people accommodate 
and resist hardship through actions of resilience based on personal, social and other 
characteristics; chief among them being gender differences. Before presenting our 
findings, we briefly touch upon the effects of the economic crisis, as identified in the 
literature, and succinctly discuss the concept of resilience as these relate with gender.  
 
 
2. Gender and economic crisis 
 
The present economic crisis has no geographical borders; it is a worldwide condition; 
or at least a condition that has caused numerous problems worldwide. Investigating 
the causes of this condition, some researchers concentrate on the global downturn, 
based solely on the capitalist nature of the economic organisation and businesses; that 
is, the accumulation of profits and wealth, purportedly promoting investment and 
creating more jobs. However, while the opportunity for investment is present, it has 
not resulted in job creation (Krugman 2009; Beder 2009). Harvey (2010) compares

production versus salaries, and claims that while salaries increased, productivity 
decreased. Finally, Seguino (2010) argues that the economic inequalities between and 
within states are the cause of the crisis.  
Contested as the causes of the economic crisis may be, researchers concur over the 
effects of the crisis: directly or indirectly, in times of recession, wages and working 
conditions decrease, while poverty increases for both men and women. However, the 
burden on women is disproportionately higher than on men. Rubery (2014, 18-19) for 
example, argues that women are inflicted harder by recessions, since they are 
segregated in vulnerable, less skilled jobs and are the first to go when lay-offs occur. 
Walby (2009) conversely maintains that women working in the ‘informal sector’ of the 
economy (e.g., seamstresses and house cleaners) are often subject to gender 
exploitation, which is intensified during periods of economic crisis, ultimately leading 
to increased poverty. Furthermore, the pay gap between men and women – women 
usually receive less pay than men for similar and even same jobs – remains a reality 
(Rubery 1988; 2014).  
A somewhat different trend is noted by Karamessini and Rubery (2014), who found a 
decrease in the employment gender gap during the crisis years, not because of 
increased gender equality but rather a slump in male-dominated posts caused by the 
recession. Comparably, research in Germany, the UK and Denmark (Leschke and 
Jespsen 2011) showed that, although the economic crisis affects both men and women, 
the measures taken by the respective governments (e.g., employment benefits, 
taxation, etc.) favour men, through the support of male-dominated sectors (with the 
exception of Denmark) and this trend is expected to persist. Moreover, Bettio, Corsi, 
D’Ippoliti, Lyberaki, Samek Lodovici, and Verashchagina (2013) show that the severe 
and negative impact of economic crises on women, results in setbacks extending 
beyond economic losses, to losses in social services, benefits and support, which have 
traditionally alleviated women’s economic burdens, as well as social policies that 
actively promote gender equality. 
Men and women in the European South, however, have sustained more losses than 
their counterparts in the European North, including job losses, diminished social rights 
and social benefits, increased working hours with less pay, etc. (Karamessini and 
Rubery 2014). Conversely, research has consistently shown that in Southern European 
countries, more so than in Northern European ones, there is a drastic reduction in the 
implementation of gender equality policies by the State, indicating thus, a stronger 
negative impact on women (Ferreira 2014; Verashchagina and Capparucci 2014; 
Gonzalez Cago and Segales Kirzner 2014). In Greece, studies also converge on the fact 
that, although the crisis severely affects both men and women, these effects are more

detrimental for women and have engendered drastic setbacks for them (Karakioulafi 
2017; Karamessini 2014a). Nevertheless, and despite – or rather in view of – hardship 
and adversity, people do survive, adapt, resist and persevere. In the following section, 
we briefly address issues related to resilience; the ability of people to thrive, despite 
adversity, and the way it relates to gender differences.  
 
 
3. Resilience and gender  
 
Resilience, albeit a contested concept, tends to be used as a reference to the “ability 
to withstand and rebound from serious life challenges” (Walsh 2015, 4; Kousis and 
Paschou 2017). As Béné, Newsham, Davies, Ulrichs, and Godfrey (2014, 606) argue, 
resilience is a ‘mobilizing metaphor’ that allows social scientists to examine and adopt 
the subject according to their point of interest and investigation: challenges from 
physical disasters (e.g., earthquakes or floods), social adversities (e.g., gender 
inequalities, economic crises), psychological tensions (e.g., family strains, divorces), etc. 
(Raco and Street 2012; Lowndes and McCaughie 2013; Martin and Sunley 2012). 
Resilience, thus, relates to strength, action and, consequently, empowerment to 
overcome adversity. Although, admittedly, there are instances in which adversities 
cannot be overcome (Harrison 2012), most researches and theorists tend to perceive 
resilience as a positive, dynamic process, which motivates action to overcome social 
and economic exclusion, passivity and dependency (Dagdeviren, Donoguue, and 
Promberger 2016), either at the collective or the individual level. Kousis and Paschou 
(2017), for instance, proposing an all-encompassing conceptual framework, introduce 
the concept of alternative forms of resilience in the face of adversity. These focus not 
only on securing basic needs but  also on improving the way of life through collective 
action – struggles for human rights, gender rights, resources, etc. (Jenkins and Rondón 
2015).  
Other approaches to resilience, focus on the individual skills, characteristics, abilities 
and attitudes that people develop in order to overcome adversities; e.g., the ‘positive 
attitudes’ of people seeking employment (Batty and Cole 2010, 23); the ‘optimistic 
attitudes’ of people living under difficult economic circumstances and the abilities 
people develop in order to overcome economic marginalisation (Harrison 2012) or to 
meet every day, basic needs (Snel and Staring 2001). Yet, other approaches explore the 
practices of individuals and families, such as the reduction of consumption, the 
increase of working hours or working within the informal sector, the reduction of basic 
needs (e.g., food, health and heat), the reduction of expenses, etc. (Harrison 2012).  
Partecipazione e conflitto, 11(1) 2018: 145-174, DOI: 10.1285/i20356609v11i1p145 
  
150 
 
A growing body of literature focuses on the mobilisation of external resources as 
resilience strategies; resources such as state and social agencies, social networks and 
voluntary organisations (Kousis 2017; Dagdeviren et al. 2016; MacKinnon and 
Derickson 2013; MacLeavy 2011; Davidson 2010; Mingione 1987). Among such studies, 
the significance of power differentials, hierarchies, privilege and the overall “social 
conditions” (Dagdeviren et al. 2016) of resilience are critically incorporated into 
understanding and explaining resilience in the context in which it is manifested. The 
inverse, argues Anderson (2015) – that is, approaching resilience in general and 
decontextualized ways – risks reifying a purportedly autonomous, individualised, 
abstracted “resilient subject” and “actively obscuring the uneven spatialities and 
temporalities of different resiliencies” (Anderson 2015, 62), as well as their 
engendering and embodiment.  
As is the case with all elements of social structure, social phenomena and social 
conditions, in this study, we consider resilience as engendered, and we view the 
‘resilient subject’ as both gendered and embodied. Thus, we place particular emphasis 
on gender, as decisive among the social conditions of resilience; not only because 
resilience for men may have a totally different form, meaning and expression than for 
women (MacLeavy 2011), but mainly because gender positions and relations are 
inextricably linked and mutually and continuously (re)defined, reinforced and/or 
reinterpreted within the gendered economic, political, legal and social structures in 
which individuals – men and women – live their lives (see, for example, Petoussi 2007; 
Petoussi-Douli, 2013). Several studies have demonstrated the importance of gender in 
understanding resilience at the individual and collective level in various parts of the 
world and in relation to multiple sources of adversity. At the least, these studies have 
shown that to fully comprehend resilience, we need to take gender into consideration 
when studying the impact that adversities have on people, the types of resources they 
can and do mobilise and the way these interact with agency and structure (Smyth and 
Sweetman 2015; Dagdeviren et al. 2016; MacLeavy 2011).  
Based on the above, and in order to better understand the relation between gender, 
the economic crisis and resilience in Greece, we comparatively examine the 
perceptions, effects, and actions caused by the economic crisis on Greek women and 
men, as well as the resilience at the personal and collective levels. Specifically, first, we 
comparatively assess men’s and women’s perceptions of the crisis. Second, taking type 
of employment as the key variable, we assess the gender effects of the economic crisis 
by investigating differences between genders and among women, such as the extent of 
participation in the labour market, employment/unemployment status, conditions of 
employment along with other corollaries which determine access to the labour market.

Finally, we investigate gender differences in resilience to adversity (actions) at the 
personal level (e.g., aspects of everyday behaviour) and the collective level (e.g., 
organisational membership and political participation).  
 
 
4. Data, methods and statistics 
 
The data used in this study derive from an original online cross-national survey9 
conducted in 2015 within the context of the LIVEWHAT (Living with Hard Times)10 
project across nine European countries and specifically the Greek sample (n=2,048). 
The sample is quota balanced to match national population statistics in terms of sex, 
age, and educational level. 
To explore the relationship between gender, economic crisis and resilience, specific 
items from the survey’s questionnaire are used11 which we present in the following 
sections. We applied descriptive and explorative analysis. With respect to the latter, we 
used Chi-Square test of Independence (χ2) to explore potential associations between 
gender, occupational categories and specific variables of interest (such as perceptions 
about the crisis, resilience actions associated with reduction in consumption, etc.). 
Moreover, we used the Independent Samples t-test to compare the mean differences 
in specific items under study (such as approval of political actions, etc.) between men 
and women. 
 
 
4.1 Perceptions of the economic crisis 
 
To assess Greek men’s and women’s perceptions of the economic crisis, we analysed 
their responses to the question “How serious do you think the economic crisis is?”. As 
shown in Table 1, 92.3% of the total sample believe that “We are suffering a serious

10 Results presented in this paper have been obtained within the project “Living with Hard Times: How 
Citizens React to Economic Crises and Their Social and Political Consequences” (LIVEWHAT). This project 
was funded by the European Commission under the 7th Framework Programme (Grant Agreement No. 
613237). More information on the project is available at: http://www.livewhat.unige.ch/

economic crisis”, while more women (51.4%) than men (48.6%) think this is the case. A 
small percentage of the total sample (5.9%) – among them more women (55.6%) than 
men (44.4%) – perceive the crisis as not very serious. A mere 1.7% of the total sample – 
among them more men (58.8%) than women (41.2%) – report that there is no 
economic crisis. No statistical differences are noted between men’s and women’s 
perceptions regarding the severity of the crisis.

Notes: % based on respondents’ selecting specific answer options  
 
In further investigating potential differences, while simultaneously considering 
gender and occupational categories12, we see (Figure 1) that among the respondents in 
our sample who consider that “we are suffering a serious economic crisis” 
(approximately 93% of the total sample) men in the upper and the lower occupational 
categories (41.1% and 21.4% respectively) are more likely than women in the same 
occupational categories (25.5% and 17% respectively) to perceive the economic crisis 
as serious. On the contrary, in the middle occupational category, it is women (48.3%) 
rather than men (23.4%) who perceive the crisis as serious. Gender comparisons 
(Figure 1) show that men in the upper occupational category are more likely to 
perceive the crisis as serious (41.1%), followed by men in the middle occupational 
 
12 Respondents’ occupational categories are measured with a recoded variable with four responses; a) 
higher occupational category including professional or higher technical work - work that requires at least 
degree-level qualifications (e.g., doctor, accountant, etc.), manager or senior administrator (e.g., company 
director, finance manager, personnel manager, senior sales manager, etc.), b) middle occupational 
category including clerical (e.g., clerk, secretary), sales or services (e.g., commercial travelled, shop 
assistant, nursery nurse, care assistant, paramedic), foreman or supervisor of other workers (e.g., building 
site foreman, supervisor of cleaning workers), c) lower occupational category including skilled manual 
work (e.g., plumber, electrician, fitter) and semi-skilled or unskilled manual work (e.g., machine operator, 
assembler, postman, waitress, cleaner, labourer, driver, etc.) and d) other (e.g., farming, military).

category (23.4%) and men in the lower occupational category (21.4%). With regards to 
women, those in the middle occupational category are more likely to perceive the crisis 
as serious (48.3%), followed by women in the upper occupational category (25.5%), 
while only 17% of women in the lower occupational category perceive the crisis as 
serious.   
It should be noted that the majority of women in the middle occupational category 
tend to be employed in the private sector, where most of the layoffs have occurred. On 
the other hand, women in the lower occupational category – although working under 
difficult conditions – can find work in the informal sector (e.g., house cleaning, care 
services, etc.) (Papageorgiou forthcoming).

 Participants’ perception of their current condition was then assessed. As Table 2 
shows, the Independent Samples T-test analysis indicates that, for the most part, men 
and women assess their current condition and future prospects in different ways, 
albeit in non-statistically significant ways. Nevertheless, men are more likely than 
women to assess their current condition as better than 12 months ago and better than 
their neighbours’ and friends’. Women, on the other hand, are more likely than men to 
see their current condition as better, compared to 5 years ago. Statistically significant 
differences are noted in the mean scores reported by men and women when assessing 
their current condition compared to their parents’ situation at same age, with men 
reporting higher mean scores. Statistically significant differences are further noted in 
the mean scores reported by men and women with regards to their future prospects.

Women report higher mean scores than men, potentially indicating a more optimistic 
view.

Overall, our findings show that men and women assess their current situation 
differently, albeit not always in statistically significant ways. Their assessments of their 
future prospects, however, differ in statistically significant ways.  
 
 
4.2 The effects of the crisis on employment/unemployment  
 
The effects of the economic crisis in the employment status of men and women are 
addressed in this section. Employment is considered as a key indicator, since it 
significantly affects the behaviour and actions of individuals (Jahoda 1982; Davou 
2015), while it simultaneously carries strong gender characteristics. In Greece, for 
example, despite noticeable changes in women’s participation in paid labour and 
employment, their work continues to be perceived as ‘auxiliary’ to the work of men 
who are entrusted with the role of breadwinner and primary income provider 
(Papageorgiou 2006; Stratigaki 2013; Karamessini 2014b). Regarding our data13, as 
 
13 In the present study, respondents’ employment status is measured with a recoded variable with seven 
responses; a) full time, b) part-time, c) unemployed (actively or not actively looking for a job), d) disability,

shown in Table 3, 38.5% of fully employed persons are men and 22% are women. 
Conversely, of those employed part-time, 10.7% are men and 13.4% are women, while 
almost 31% of those unemployed are women, compared to 27% who are men.

Because of the economic crisis however, employment status and mainly working 
conditions14 for both men and women have been negatively impacted. As shown in 
Figure 2, 85% of men and 75% of women report a reduction in pay, 65% of men and 
60% of women report unpaid overtime, followed by 58% of men and 55% of women 
seeking additional work or accepting reduced work benefits (53% and 41.8% 
respectively). A notable percentage (40.6%) of men and women (29.2%) are among 
those who sought and accepted work in the informal sector, with undeclared pay and 
income. It is more than likely that, faced with the prospect of job loss, individuals – at a 
variable extent – accept losses in security and benefits, or consent to worsening 
working conditions. In our sample, however, higher percentages of men rather than 
women tend to report losses in all of the measured categories; the predominant loss 
being reduction of pay, followed by overtime work without pay. Given that men 
continue to be considered as the breadwinners of the family and that male gender 
identity is closely linked to providing for the family, keeping their jobs at any cost can 
be logically expected. The significance of this social condition on the gendered impact 
of the economic crisis, as well as gendered resilience, has also been shown in recent 
 
e) retired, f) housework (doing housework, looking after children or other persons), and g)’other’ including 
individuals in education and/or in community or military service. 
14 Respondents’ working conditions are measured with dichotomous items capturing, among others, 
changes in the last five years associated with reduced payments, acceptance of an additional job, working 
unpaid extra hours, undeclared payments.

research in Greece (Bakas 2017). On the other hand, it could be the case that men’s 
privileged position in the labour market (compared to women’s), has allowed for larger 
margins of losses, while their gender role and their overall reduced social reproduction 
responsibilities allowed for increased working hours or additional working hours.

Graph 2. Effects of the economic crisis on work conditions per gender  
 
 
As mentioned above, international literature and research has consistently shown 
that the effects of the economic crisis (and other crises) differentiate, not only 
between genders, but within gender as well, with women of lower socio-economic 
status and higher vulnerability suffering harsher consequences. To assess this situation 
in Greece, we looked at the effects of the economic crisis on women, for each of the 
occupational categories. As shown in Figure 3, accepting reduction in pay tends to be 
the dominant effect of the economic crisis for women in all occupational categories. 
Nevertheless, women in the lower occupational category are more likely than women 
in any other occupational category to report losses (81.4% compared to 76.4% in the 
upper occupational category, 75% in the ‘other’ occupational category and 73.8% in 
the middle occupational category). Similarly, women in the lower occupational 
category are more likely (64.4%) to seek additional employment and accept reduced 
work benefits (47.5%), while higher percentages of women in the middle occupational 
category report working overtime without pay.

Based on the above, we can argue that women are differently impacted, depending 
on their occupational category. For example, women in the upper occupational 
category – even though they tend to accept reduction in pay and work overtime 
without pay –are not as likely to seek additional employment. Somewhat differently, 
women in the middle occupational category are more likely to work overtime and 
accept pay reductions; seeking additional employment and work is their third reported 
option. We can venture to say that for these categories of women, the economic crisis 
has mandated adjustments in order to keep a job rather than to seek additional work. 
On the other hand, women in the lower occupational category face, cumulatively, 
higher adversities than women in any of the other occupational categories.  
 
 
4.3 Resilience strategies - personal level 
 
In the face of adversity – in this case, economic adversity – individuals and groups 
mobilise internal and external resources, in order to overcome and resist hardship and 
destitution and cope with their everyday problems (Harrison 2012; Seccombe 2002; 
Orthner, Jones-Sanpei, and Williamson 2004). Taking gender differences as our focal 
interest and concern, we concentrate on resilience actions by men and women in their 
everyday lives. Firstly, we look at the individual level and then at the more collective 
responses and actions; as a proxy, we look at the respondents’ approval of political 
Partecipazione e conflitto, 11(1) 2018: 145-174, DOI: 10.1285/i20356609v11i1p145 
  
158 
 
actions, active participation in various organisations and their involvement in political 
behaviours.  
To assess citizens’ resilience during the period of the economic crisis, participants 
were asked to rate a number of items on a scale ranging from 0 (‘completely unlike 
me’) to 10 (‘Just like me’). As shown in Table 4, men and women report similar mean 
scores in looking for creative ways to alter difficult situations (mean scores of 8.24 and 
8.23 respectively). However, men report significantly higher mean scores than women 
(mean values of 8.10 and 7.84 respectively) in actively looking for ways to replace 
losses they encounter in life. However, negative statements tend to have higher mean 
scores, especially for women. Women, for example, report higher mean scores in 
having a harder time than men ‘making it through stressful events’ (mean scores of 
6.13 and 5.56 respectively). On the other hand, women appear more connected with 
the communities in which they live in, than men. In the relevant statement (‘I feel that 
no one in the community where I live seems to care much about me’) the mean score 
for men (6.68) is higher than the equivalent for women (6.12), while they differ in 
statistically significant ways.

On a more practical level, and centred around the reduction of consumption, the 
responses of the study’s participants to the question of whether in the past 5 years 
they, or someone else in their household, had to take any number of measures for

financial or economic reasons, are shown in Table 5. As expected, there are notable 
differences between men’s and women’s responses. These differences however, for 
the most part, are not statistically significant. For example, a higher percentage of 
women, compared to men, tend to report a reduction in recreational activities, delayed 
payments of utilities, cutting TV/phone/internet services and moving home. On the 
other hand, higher percentages of men tend to report reduced use of own car, 
consumption of staple foods and delays or default of loan payments. Statistically 
significant differences are noted in the percentages of men (77.4%) and women 
(81.0%) who report not going on vacation and postponing or reducing buying medicine 
or visiting a doctor (63.1% and 70.6%, respectively). In both cases, it is women who 
appear to be more concerned about having to take such measures.

In other words, in all but two categories, there is no statistical difference in the 
actions reported by men and women as far as their practices of facing adversities 
during the crisis period are concerned. On the other hand – although not directly 
deduced from the data – it can be argued that the differences noted between men and 
women in the reporting of measures taken in order to face adversities during the 
economic crisis may be attributed to the gender division of labour and the gendered 
allocation of home and family responsibilities. It is likely, for example, that the

emphasis women place on recreational activities15, vacation time, utilities, health care, 
etc., relate to their role as homemakers and care providers.  
As shown above, however, the impact of the economic crisis as well as the available 
resources to be mobilised in the face of adversities differ between social groups, 
including occupational groups between genders and within gender. In Table 6, we 
present our findings for a few selected items of the ‘reduced consumption’ category, in 
which women’s responses either significantly differ statistically from men’s or are close 
to such a difference, along with the item of ‘consumption of stable foods’, because of 
its significance to people’s well-being. We look at these differences per occupational 
category.

Examining the differences in reducing consumption across women’s occupational 
groups, we find that the reduction of recreational activities is the measure most 
frequently reported, regardless of occupational group (Table 6). The upper and middle 
occupational categories of women report similar percentages of reduction in 
recreational activities (93.4% and 93.5% respectively) while the higher percentage is 
reported by women in the lower occupational category (96.4%). The differences are 
statistically significant. Similarly, delayed payment of utilities differs in statistically 
significant ways between occupational categories of women. Women in the lower

men and women is almost statistically significant (p-value=0.053).

occupational category report the highest percentage of such measures (87.3%), 
followed by women in the middle occupational category (79.7%) and women in the 
upper occupational category (68.9%). A reduction in staple food consumption is 
reported by 73.1% of women in the lower economic category, 71.1% of women in the 
‘other’ occupational category and 70.7% of women in the middle occupational 
category. Finally, a reduction or postponement of purchasing of medicines or visiting a 
doctor, albeit reported more often (73.4%) by women in the middle occupational 
category compared to their counterparts in the upper (70.7%) and lower (65.9%) 
occupational categories. It follows, therefore, that in order to fully comprehend the 
effect and impact of the crisis and the resources available and mobilised, we must 
focus on the multiple differences and hierarchies, including gender.  
  
 
4.4 Resilience strategies - networks and resources  
 
To deal with adversities during economic and other crises, individuals mobilise 
networks and available resources. In Table 7, we present the relevant findings of our 
study. Our study participants (total sample) often face significant difficulties in ‘getting 
by’ (64.2%), but they can tend to turn to family members (79.7%), other people who 
can ‘take them in’ (68.8%) or can lend them money (57.9%). Furthermore, 
homeownership (58.1%) rather than private insurance (15.1%) or social welfare and 
care (8.4%) appear to provide a ‘safety net’ for our study participants.  
With regards to the majority of resources and activities mobilised, our study does 
not indicate statistically significant differences between men and women, except for 
homeownership and the types of recreational activities to which men and women 
participate. Specifically, men more so than women (63.2% and 53.2% respectively), 
place emphasis on homeownership as a resilience resource. Women, on the other 
hand, differ from men, in a statistically significant way, in their participation in activities 
such as going to shows and other similar recreational activities (43.1% and 36.6% 
respectively), while men are more likely than women to turn to athletic and sports 
activities (29.3% and 17.5% respectively).

4.5 Resilience strategies - approval of political actions, organisational 
membership and political involvement  
 
Imposed austerity measures brought about discontent among Greek people and 
resulted, at least during the initial phase of the economic crisis, in a wave of public 
protests expressed in conventional (e.g., marches, demonstrations) as well as 
unconventional forms (e.g., occupation of public places) (see Kousis 2014). Political 
activity, including participation in organisations supporting and promoting political 
and/or social causes and goals has been included among resilience activities in the 
context of economic crises (Kousis 2017). Nevertheless, political activity and 
Yota Papageorgiou, Vasiliki Petousi, Gender resilience in times of economic crisis: Findings from Greece 
 
163 
 
organisational membership is experienced and expressed differently by the gendered 
polity; men and women. To address this aspect of citizen resilience in Greece, we focus 
on the differences between men’s and women’s reported approval of political 
actions16, their membership in organisations and their active political involvement.  
As shown in Table 8, men and women in our sample tend to report higher mean 
scores, thus, higher approval of legal and peaceful forms of political protest (e.g., 
strikes and marches). Unlike other findings in this study, there is a clear, statistically 
significant differentiation in the forms of approved political actions between men and 
women. Women show higher mean scores of approval than men for marches and 
demonstrations (mean scores 7.34 and 6.92, respectively), and for participation in 
strikes (mean scores 6.68 and 6.24 respectively). On the other hand, men are more 
likely than women to approve of more violent forms of protest such as the blocking of 
roads and damaging public property (mean scores 2.48 and 2.18, respectively).

Resilience, however, is more likely to be linked to active and engaging participation 
in organisations and overall political action, rather than to simple positive attitudes and 
the approval of such actions. Thus, in our study we measured the actual, active 
participation of men and women in various organisations17 and their engagement in 
conventional and non-conventional forms of political action. 
 
16 According to the study’s questionnaire, it measures on a scale ranging from 0 (‘Strongly disapprove’) to 
10 (‘Strongly approve’) respondents’ approval of four political actions including marching through town, 
taking part in strikes, occupying public squares indefinitely, taking actions such as blocking roads or 
damaging public property. 
17 The specific items measure whether respondents: a) belong and do volunteer/unpaid work (active 
membership), b) just belong (passive membership) or c) do not belong (non-membership) in different

164 
 
As shown in Table 9, only a small percentage of our respondents reports active 
membership in various organisations. Nevertheless, social solidarity networks or, in 
other words, networks which can function as external resources and support for 
resilience attract higher rates of active membership (9.8%), followed by 
development/human rights organisations (5.6%), environmental, anti-nuclear or 
animal rights organisations (4.3%). Political party active membership is reported by 
4.1% of our sample, while participation in other organisations such as peace and 
anti/war, civil rights/civil liberties, women’s/feminist organisations, etc., follow with 
considerably lower percentages. In that respect, our study partially deviates from 
Kapekaki’s (2013) findings that both men and women, at the early part of the economic 
crisis have reconsidered their public practices and participate more in non-institutional 
organisations.

groups/organisations. For the rationale of the present study, the analysis focuses only on responses 
associated with active membership in different groups/organisations.

Gender differences exist with respect to the types of organisations in which men 
and women participate. For the most part, men report higher (although not statistically 
significant) participation rates than women, in almost all types of organisations with 
the exception of social solidarity networks, development and human rights 
organisations. As expected, women’s rate of participation in women’s/feminist 
organisations is higher and statistically significant from the equivalent of men (2.1% 
and 1.5% respectively). Statistically significant differences also exist between men’s 
and women’s participation in political parties (4.3% and 3.8), labour and trade union 
organisations (3.5% and 2.0%) and anti-capitalist, global justice, or anti-globalisation 
organisations (2.5% and 0.4%), in which men’s active participation is higher than 
women’s.  
Political behaviour, viewed in this study as a proxy for resilience at the collective 
level, was further measured through composite indexes capturing political involvement 
in conventional, unconventional (soft and violent) and online political actions18. 
Statistically significant differences are found in the political involvement of men and 
women in our sample. As shown in Table 10, men’s mean scores indicate a higher level 
of involvement in conventional (mean scores 1.77 and 1.61 respectively) and 
unconventional violent behaviour (mean scores 1.41 and 1.34 respectively), and online 
participation (mean scores 2.54 and 2.41 respectively) than women. On the other 
hand, women tend to participate more in unconventional soft political behaviours than 
 
18 Based on Marsh and Kaase’s (1979) classification of different types of conventional and unconventional 
political involvement the following composite indexes are constructed. Respondents’ involvement in 
conventional political actions is measured with an additive score including contacting/visiting a 
politician/government/local government official, donating money to a political organisation/party/action 
group, displaying a political or campaign logo/badge/sticker, and attending a meeting of a political 
organisation/party/action group. Respondents’ higher scores in the composite index indicate greater 
involvement in conventional political actions. 
Respondents’ involvement in unconventional soft political actions is measured with an additive score 
including signing a petition/public letter/campaign appeal, boycotting certain products for 
political/ethical/environment reasons, deliberately buying products for political/ethical/environment 
reasons and attending a demonstration/march/rally. Respondents’ higher scores in the composite index 
indicate greater involvement in unconventional soft political actions. 
Respondents’ involvement in unconventional violent political actions is measured with an additive score 
including joining a strike, an occupation/sit-in/blockade, damaging things like breaking windows, removing 
roads signs, etc., and using personal violence like fighting with the police. Respondents’ higher scores in 
the composite index indicate greater involvement in unconventional violent political actions. 
Respondents’ involvement in online political actions is measured with an additive score including 
discussing/sharing opinion on politics on social network sites, joining/starting a political group on 
Facebook/following a politician/political group on Twitter, visiting the website of a political party/politician 
and searching for information about politics online.

men (mean scores 2.37 and 2.22 respectively). The above further corroborate the 
findings of this study that men’s and women’s actions of resilience in the form of 
political participation differ frequently in statistically significant ways and point to the 
importance of gender in understanding resilience.

5. Concluding remarks 
 
In this article, we examined the impact of Greece’s economic crisis on men and 
women, primarily on employment and working conditions. We further investigated 
gender differences in perceptions of the crisis, as well as actions of resilience at the 
personal and political level, expressed as reduction in consumption, approval of 
political actions and active political involvement, such as participation in various 
organisations and engagement in conventional, unconventional and online political 
behaviour.  
The thesis underlying our research is that gender is a decisive factor defining one’s 
socio-political and economic status. We further postulate that gender, consistently and 
powerfully interacts with other sources of hierarchies and power, and thus delineates 
one’s perceptions, attitudes, resources, constraints, and everyday life. Our third 
contention is that, faced with adversities caused by crises such as the economic crisis 
afflicting Greece for over 7 years, people, both men and women, through diverse 
actions of accommodation, adjustment, etc. – in other words, through actions of 
resilience – withstand hardships and bounce back.   
Findings in this research are based on Greek data derived from an original online 
survey conducted in 2015 within the context of the LIVEWHAT project. Our findings 
concur with other studies, which show that the economic crisis in Greece has resulted 
in multiple ill effects for individuals and the country. These, however, differentiate on

the basis of various structural and demographic variables (Giannakis and Bruggeman 
2017; Artelaris 2017; Kakdesi and Tasopoulou 2017).  
Focusing on gender as one of the differentiating factors of the impact of the 
economic crisis, our study shows that losses in employment and working conditions are 
more frequently reported by both men and women in all occupational categories. 
Nevertheless, men in our sample, as a group, appear to report higher losses than 
women as a group; these losses include reductions in salaries, an increase in unpaid 
overtime, seeking additional employment, etc. The same types of losses are also 
reported by women while, within gender differences, women in the lower occupational 
category tend to sustain more significant losses.  
To fully comprehend the significance and the implications of these findings, 
however, we need to consider that the gendered positioning of men and women in 
Greek society assigns the responsibility of providing for the family through work force 
participation to men, while women are entrusted primarily with social reproduction 
responsibilities (e.g., family care) and their labour force participation is often seen as 
secondary and auxiliary to men’s. Linked to their gender identity and structurally 
supported (see for example the discussion in Leschke and Jespsen 2011 on the state 
support to men’s jobs during economic crises), men’s labour force participation is 
privileged; they tend to receive higher salaries, occupy higher positions in work 
hierarchies, receive more benefits and furthermore have higher work flexibility, as they 
tend to be relieved of family and care obligations. On the one hand, they have ‘more to 
lose’, so to speak, and, on the other, they are socially obligated to maintain and affirm 
their gender role at all costs (see, for example, Bakas 2017).  
However, women’s losses need to be understood in the context of plummeted 
workforce participation and a related reversal of women’s workforce participation 
gains. This bleak situation is intensified by the reality of the reduced social welfare 
benefits enhancing the social vulnerability of various social groups and, within them, 
women in particular (see, similarly, Bettio et al. 2013) as well as de-prioritized gender 
social policies (Papageorgiou forthcoming; Stratigaki 2013). Indicative of the above, is 
our finding that women in the lower occupational category have sustained more losses 
than women in any other occupational category. Not surprisingly, thus, both men and 
women perceive the economic crisis as being a serious one.  
Nevertheless, people do resist the effects of the economic crisis. Men show a more 
self-reliant and resource-based approach (i.e., they are more likely to seek creative 
ways to alter difficult situations or consider homeownership as a significant asset), 
while women are more likely to report having difficulties making it through stressful

events, and are also less likely to feel that no one in their community seems to care 
about them, than men do.  
Reduction in consumption appears to be a common action undertaken by both men 
and women in our study. However, women appear to place much more emphasis on 
reduction in recreation activities and health care issues. It is likely that women’s social 
role as family care providers is reflected in their reporting. It may be the case, that 
being socially responsible for the well-being of their families, women are concerned 
that loss of vacation time negatively impacts the time that families and/or couples can 
spend together. On the other hand, their concern over reducing or postponing the 
purchase of medicines and visiting a doctor may be linked to their role and 
responsibility as care providers, which includes caring for the health of family 
members. It is also likely, that the emphasis women place on vacation and recreation is 
a reflection of their need for free time, given the double burden of family and work 
they carry.  
Resilience, on the other hand, is also assessed in people’s active engagement in 
political action. In the context of Greece and other countries, this element of resilience 
has been addressed and has provided insights on the changes that crises produce for 
the polity (Kousis 2014; Kapekaki 2013). Our findings show that political engagement 
differs between genders. Women, more often than men, tend to be active members of 
social solidarity networks and organisations, including women’s and feminist ones, 
broadly oriented towards social justice issues. On the other hand, political action, 
characteristic of the public domain, remains men’s territory; the only exception being 
participation in unconventional soft political actions (e.g. signing of petitions 
boycotting or consuming products as a form of protest or support and attending 
demonstrations, marches or rallies). Women, thus, tend to engage in political actions 
which arguably, tend to characterize social solidarity movements and networking. It 
should also be noted at this point, that the research findings point to the importance of 
social solidarity networks in building community resilience (see, for example, Papadaki 
and Kalogeraki 2017 for a discussion of the significance of social solidarity actions in 
building and sustaining community resilience). Although not directly addressed in this 
study, we could venture to say that community building, and therefore community 
resilience building, to some degree involves building and maintaining links and 
relationships with individuals and groups and, as such, falls within women’s social 
reproduction responsibilities. To that extent, women’s political action is linked to their 
gender role and position. Similarly, men’s political engagement, frequently entailing 
confrontational actions, is aligned with their stereotypical and conventional 
understanding of their gender role and position.

Overall, our study shows that to fully comprehend the impact of the economic crisis 
and people’s resilience, gender considerations need to be an integral part of any study. 
In addition to the observable and expected financial, economic and work-related 
impact, attention should be given to the latent functions of gender positions and their 
interaction with other forms of social hierarchies and power, in order to assess the full 
personal and social impact of adversities but mainly the resources – personal and social 
– which are and can be further mobilised in order to resist and overcome hardships 
and bounce back. 
As Anderson (2015, 64) puts it, “resilience never happens on its own in pure form. It 
co-exists in complex fields alongside other ways of governing life and, as such, is part of 
a series of intensifications, redeployments and (dis)continuities”. Gender is pivotal in 
these complex fields.
