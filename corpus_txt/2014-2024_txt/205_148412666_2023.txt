Local communities are adversely affected, but the essential cultural assets and economies are also at risk of damage or destruction. In the efforts to limit hazard risk exposure, local governments are increasingly planning for long-term flood protection. One prospective flood risk mitigation measure is living shorelines or nature-based adaptation. The coastal ecosystems, such as beaches, wetlands, barrier islands, oyster reefs, and salt marshes, deliver multiple benefits to communities, including recreation, natural resources, freshwater, and carbon sequestration. Moreover, when combined with structural solutions, they can effectively reduce water and storm wave energy levels. Despite these positive effects, the implementation of NbS is limited by a scarce understanding of their performance against uncertain sea level rise projections, their economic impacts, and funding gaps. In this research, I aimed to enforce this knowledge by assessing the economic values of various nature-based coastal adaptation solutions applied to the Charleston Peninsula. Tourism and recreation sectors substantially contribute to the local economy, and my assessment model focuses on them as a potential source of sharing resilience upfront costs. The nature-based adaptation generative algorithm model is spatially explicit and scenario-based, which helps reduce uncertainties. The adaptive interface helps answer my research questions and estimate the performance of Nature-based and Hybrid adaptation strategies in preventing tourism operation disruption over the planning scenarios. The model also evaluates recreational activity induced by proposed green infrastructure to expand the range of ecosystem services incorporated in the methods of economic impact assessment.

Nothing is impossible with the right intention in the heart, the right thoughts in mind, the right people to support us on our way, and an abiding passion for making this planet a better place to live. As a Russian urban designer and planner, I want to contribute this work to a proactive strive towards brighter and happier cities and against wars, aggression, mismanagement, and misinformation. This research was conceived long before the dramatic conflict between my home country and the country of a big part of my family and friends began. It was initially focused on protecting the masterpieces of human civilization – historic maritime cities – as the global pandemic has shown our vulnerability to environmental disasters. Here, I must refer to Italo Calvino, whose immortal piece “Invisible Cities” (Le città invisibili) guided my focus on the fundamental values woven into the factual matter of my research. As the plot of this light and the profoundly poetic novel goes, Marco Polo`s storytelling expresses the diverse characters of 55 cities to Kublai Khan as he asks about his empire. In the last chapter, a reader sees them all coming together in the only beloved city of the author – Venice. As the changes came to our homes in February 2023, I reconsidered the notion of resilience and embraced the broader range of external and internal stresses it addresses. After all, it has a much broader sense and application than solely climate related. With this additional level of dedication, I take my step to make a change and encourage more people to believe in the power of one on our way to a shared, resilient future.   Clemson CRP.

I would never have become that perseverant unless my parents and grandparents inspired me with their hard labor in peace and joy. I am thankful to all City and Regional Program staff, especially Dr. Caitlin S. Dyckman, Dr. Eric A. Morris, and Dr Lynn M. Abdouni, for their presence, wisdom, and talent to narrow the topic down when I was falling into the rabbit hole. A great inspiration in optimism, wit, and insight was Dr. John Gaber and Dr. Barry Nocks, the sources of concise advice with a significant impact.  My work with One Architecture and Urbanism in New York in Summer 2022 became the turning point in finalizing my research topic. Their drive and energy in developing better implementable coastal resilience solutions were crucial when I was oscillating between two topics to make a final choice of the idea of this model. Special thanks are dedicated to Matthijs Bouw – the adept of living shorelines and the most bright and optimistic chief I have ever been working with, Travis Bunt for his concise and provisional recommendations, and Justine Shapiro-Kline for her wisdom, modest dedication to collective results, and inspirational elegance in working culture. I appreciate the drive for a global vision nurtured in me by my first academic advisor M.V. Shubenkov who patiently and passionately led my thesis back in Moscow Architectural Institute in 2011. I will be forever grateful to all my Russian and Ukrainian friends and colleagues, who bravely stayed against the criminal actions and were great support during the political conflict. I am particularly grateful to my inspirators, Anna Leksina and Anna Nosova – for the love, talent, wit, and humor - being our only weapons. And finally - to my Muse - for guiding me silently from a distant shore.  Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman.

(Adger et al., 2005) Attenuation capacities - the ability of natural features, such as wetlands, reefs, or dunes, to reduce the energy and height of waves as they approach the shore, and with that - protect coastal areas from erosion and flooding caused by storm surges and extreme weather events. Bathymetry - the depth and topography of the seafloor near the shoreline, including the nearshore zone, surf zone, and intertidal zone. Shoreline bathymetry is important for understanding coastal processes such as erosion, sediment transport, and wave propagation, and is measured using sonar, Lidar, and satellite imagery. Business operation loss - economic losses incurred by businesses due to physical damage and operational disruption caused by a natural disaster. It includes both direct and indirect economic losses. Chronic inundation - recurrent flooding of coastal areas due to sea level rise happening with the growing frequency even in the absence of a major storm event (UCSUSA, 2017) Climada (CLIMate ADAptation) - an open-source software tool designed for risk assessment and management of natural hazards. It is a modular system that can simulate and model different types of natural hazards, including floods, tropical cyclones, heatwaves, and wildfires, among others. Coastal resilience - ability of a coastal system to withstand and recover from disturbances, such as storms, sea level rise, and erosion, while maintaining its essential functions Clemson CRP.

Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 8   8 and structure, measured as its capacity to absorb shocks and adapt to changing conditions while minimizing negative impacts on human communities and ecosystems. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) -  a tool to estimate and compare the costs and monetized value of the expected outputs of an investment or policy actions Cost-effectiveness analysis - comparative costs and output evaluation. Co-benefits of ecosystem services - the positive results of actions taken to protect or restore ecosystems and implementing nature-based solutions. Include a wide range of benefits beyond the primary goal of ecosystem restoration, such as  improved air and water quality, increased biodiversity, enhanced recreational opportunities, and even economic benefits such as increased tourism or reduced healthcare costs. Direct benefits - the effects that match with the environmental outcomes of interest. Discounting - estimating the present value of future benefits and assets. EBA - Ecosystem-based approaches to adaptation ECA - Economics of Climate Adaptation framework of risk and cost effectiveness assessment (CCRIF, 2010; ECA, 2009) developed by the Economics of Climate Adaptation Working Group, Global Environment Facility, McKinsey & Company, Swiss Re, the Rockefeller Foundation, ClimateWorks Foundation, the European Commission, and Standard Chartered Bank (Reguero et al., 2014) Ecosystem restoration - “The process of establishing or reestablishing a habitat that in time can come to closely resemble a natural condition in terms of structure and function.” (Baggett et al., 2014; Schuster & Doerr, TNC, 2015) Ecosystem services: benefits provided by ecosystems - provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services (Reid et al. 2005).

Gray infrastructure - engineered or built infrastructure, such as hydropower reservoirs, dams, pipelines, and water and wastewater treatment plants (Gartner et al. 2013). Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - measure of the total value of goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period of time, provides an indication of the size and growth rate of an economy, and is a key indicator of a country's economic performance. Hybrid infrastructure - conjunction or combination of green and gray infrastructure, such as bioswales, green roofs, constructed wetlands, living shorelines. Implementation costs - upfront capital and land expenditures associated with a strategy implementation (Verdone, 2015). Indirect benefits - complementary effects of an intervention benefiting public welfare. Input-output analysis - economic method that examines the interdependencies between different sectors of an economy. It analyzes how changes in one sector can affect other sectors, by looking at the inputs and outputs of goods and services between sectors. Internal rate of return – financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project (Quinn et al.,2019). Return on investment ROI – a metric used to measure the profitability of an investment, expressed as a percentage. It compares the gain or loss from an investment relative to its cost, taking into account the time value of money. (BMUB, Emerton, 2017). Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 10   10 Least cost analysis - comparing the costs of alternatives and selecting the option that achieves the outcome at the lowest cost. Often used in environmental and resource management, where limited resources need to be allocated efficiently to achieve the greatest benefits. NbS - Nature-based solutions that protect and restore ecosystems and adaptively address challenges to provide well-being and biodiversity. (International Union for Conservation of Nature IUCN; Cohen-Shacham et al., 2019; Shiao et al, 2020). These solutions help build resilience through intervention of natural processes into various landscapes (European Commission; Maes & Jacobs, 2015). These actions are supported or copied from nature and aim to bring multiple co-benefits (European Parliament, 2017). Net Present Value (NPV) - economic evaluation of the costs and benefits of implementing measures considering the initial investment costs and the expected benefits over a certain period of time, adjusted for inflation and discount rate. RCP - Representative Concentration Pathways (IPCC AR6, WGII, 2022) Return on investment analysis - financial analysis to estimate the correlation of return on an investment and its cost. Robustness - capacity to remain unaffected by variations in parameters. Robust NbS achieves the objectives and reduces the risk under uncertain scenarios. Sensitivity analysis - explores how uncertainty in the model output is attributed to different independent variables. Time horizon/ planning horizon/ time frame – a period used for the analysis. Must correspond with the lifespan of major infrastructure components as aligns with the decision making terms (Talberth et al. 2013). Transaction costs - time, labor, and resources to process a deal (Lile et al. 1998). Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 11   11 Uncertainty – scientific or knowledge-gap induced situation when the probability distribution of a result of an action taken is unknown or hardly estimated. Useful life, or lifespan - timeframe when infrastructure stay productive (WRI, 2019) Value for money – economic assessment method that involves comparing the costs of a particular project, program, or policy with its expected benefits, and assessing whether the benefits justify the costs. Value for money analysis considers both financial and non-financial costs and benefits, such as social and environmental impacts. Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) - a method used to evaluate the economic value that individuals place on a particular good, service, or environmental attribute, based on surveying.   Clemson CRP.

The ongoing climate change forces governments to plan for protection considering scientific projections as opposed to the current situation. Coastal ecosystems and communities are the most physically affected by exponentially growing risks induced by climate change. (IPCC, WGII, 2022, UCCRN, 2018). Multiple scientific reports and industry leaders concur with the need for long-term climate preparedness in response to climate change induced hazard risks (IPCC, WGII AR5; Noble et al., 2014; Waggonner & Ball, 2019). These extended horizons raise the question of long-lasting hazard risk adaptation to assure sustained social wellbeing. Nature based solutions – also called NbS, living shorelines, or ecosystem-based adaptation strategies - bring multiple benefits to communities, economies, and ecosystems, including flood attenuation (Kumar et al., 2021; Moraes et al., 2022; Lebbe et al., 2022; Guerry et al., 2022; Barbier et al., 2011; Shiao et al., 2020; Reguero et al., 2018; Onofri, Nunes, 2020; Mehvar et al., 2018; van der Meulen et al., 2022). Coastal adaptation can be based on “soft engineering” (Baills, Garcin, Bulteau, 2020), or ecosystem-based strategies, such as beach nourishment, wetlands restoration, barrier islands, oyster reefs, and salt marshes (Sutton-Grier, Wowk, Bamford, 2015). Despite their benefits, implementation of NbS is limited by scientific uncertainties and the lack of financing. Also, the effects on the adjacent lands are not easily predictable due to the complexity of the ecosystems and vary on the magnitude and speed of storms. (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Langridge et al., 2014). And finally, natural preservation is associated with the conflict of environmental and economic interests, as it competes with the Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 13   13 established community uses and economic development (Campbell, 1996, Emerton et al., 2017; Reguero et al., 2014; Baig et al., 2016). The broader implementation of NbS needs advanced knowledge on their performance, economic impacts, and financing sources. Coastal cities tend to have densely urbanized shorelines due to the traditional role of cultural centers with essential assets concentrated next to the water (Rebuild by Design, 2014; Sutton-Grier et al, 2015; Koch et al., 2009; Gedan et al., 2011; Shephard et al., 2012; Narayan et al., 2017; Barbier et al., 2013; USACE, 2006). The approach to NbS evaluation must involve the full range of benefits, including tourism and recreation, and their dynamics over time along with the expected climate and socioeconomic changes (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Kousky, 2014). I aim to contribute to this research gap by answering my research questions and developing an adaptive scenario-based economic model of a protection solution (de Ruig et al., 2019; Graveline &  Grémont, 2017).  Research question I focused on the economic effects of ecosystem-based and hybrid coastal protection in terms of local business activity, to answer the following questions: (1) How do NbS and Hybrid coastal adaptation strategies contribute to the local economy in terms of preventing tourism sector operation disruption and added recreational value in terms of the annual economic activity and? (2) How do these expected effects vary between the time of implementation and their lifespan under the different climate change scenarios? I used an economic development assessment of NbS to estimate their impacts on an urban scale in 10 and 50 years. In this assessment I focused on the response of NbS against two types of flood risks – projected sea level rise and coastal storm surge - as most likely to happen and most damaging events respectively. The economic effects I focused on included revenues of tourism businesses located Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 14   14 in the study area - as this sector of the economy has a significant role in coastal areas and especially historic cities. The exposure of tourism and recreation to the two flood risks and the protection provided by the NbS is measured for the two climate change scenarios in the short- and long-term time horizons. Each of the four resulting scenarios considers two levels of water - projected sea level rise and expected extreme storm waves. Thus, “with” and “without project” scenarios set permanent and temporary flood exposures for these hazards. I have found the monetary values of economic impacts for the economic sector of interest to assess the NbS performance. The case I have chosen for my study is Charleston, SC. The city experiences recurrent floods and as a result has a long history of adaptation proposals. Developed coastal zone, data availability, and the major role of the tourism sector make Charleston Peninsula the proper case for this study (Waggonner & Ball, 2019; Conservation League, 2021; Davis et al., 2021). The studies I used to build my methodology upon comprise the USACE Peninsula study and a number of more ecosystem-friendly alternatives, including One Architecture in consortium with Biohabitats “Imagine the wall” visionary proposal, Coastal Conservation League, and Charleston Civic center (Conservation League, 2021; Davis et al., 2021; Biohabitats, One, Inc, 2021). The barriers to implementing these alternatives are the lack of knowledge and financing sources, which I aim to contribute to with my research.  In planning for coastal resilience, the longer lifespan of a project must be considered to assess its effects during and after implementation. Under the uncertainties on the rates of climate-change induced sea level rise, the proper approach is scenario-based planning, providing several paths of adaptation (IPCC, WGII, 2022; Lopez, 2009; Loayza et al., 2012). I measured Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 15   15 economic impacts of ecosystem-based strategies for the recreation and service sectors, following the recent studies and establishing economic metrics of recreation and tourism essential for the lasting community resilience (Vousdoukas, Mentaschi, Hinkel et al., 2020; Reguero et al., 2020; de Ruig, et al, 2019; Herrera, et al. , 2019; Levy, Herst, 2018; Basker & Miranda, 2014). I compared these effects under several climate and socio-economic scenarios contributing to adaptive capacity (Shiao et al., 2020; Reguero et al., 2014; Reguero et al., 2018; Neumann et al, 2010b; Herrera, et al. , 2019; Barbier et al., 2013; Johnston et al., 2002; Shiao et al., 2020; Reguero et al., 2018; Onofri, Nunes, 2020; Baig et al., 2016; Emerton, 2017; Lebbe et al., 2022; Moraes et al., 2022).  Overview I focused my study on the ecosystem services provided by Nature-based coastal strategies, also called living shorelines, in terms of preventing business interruption and added recreational values. The area of my research is the city center of Charleston, South Carolina. First, I conducted literature review to provide the context and gaps in existing knowledge. I analyzed five major bodies of literature, comprising climate change-induced coastal risks and hazards, coastal resilience approaches, NbS measurements and implementation, the economic impact assessment metrics of these interventions, and finally the status of their implementation in the study area – Charleston Peninsula.  Further, I generated my research method based on literature and state-of-the-art geospatial analysis approaches. My research is framed out as an experimental parametric algorithm. I used GIS and Grasshopper interfaces to connect various factors and four research strands – flood risk, adaptation suitability, economic loss prevention, and recreation co-benefits - to assess the living shorelines performance on the local level. The estimations are geographically Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 16   16 explicit and scenario-based so that they can be updated as data availability and the inputs evolve over time and geographic context. Finally, I discussed the results, policy implications, and limitations of the research and parametric model. I conclude with discussion and explanation of the data gaps and further research, including testing of the model in other comparable localities, expanding component parts, refining the data, and solving the compounding errors. The contribution to the economics of nature-based coastal adaptation is discussed in the conclusion fostering the knowledge on implementation of the Nature-based strategies (Levy, Herst, 2018).

Climate change Context Climate induced temperature shifts have occurred several times in the last millennia, although we are facing the unprecedented acceleration of these trends currently. They affect both natural and built environments across the world, imposing major risks on the centerpieces of cultural and economic activity – coastal cities. Coastal floods have already displaced over 650 million people across the globe in the last 35 years (Kocornic-Mina et al., 2020), and according to projections, will affect over 800 million coastal citizens with the high magnitude flood events by the year 2050 (UCCRN, 2018).  Since 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change plays a leading role in climate change science, impacts, and policy recommendations. Their comprehensive reports inform nations of the status and trends of climate change up to the year 2100. The progress in GHG emissions mitigation has demonstrated only modest results, and the communities still need to adapt to the changing climate to protect cities, ecosystems, and resources for the future generations (UCCRN, 2018; Kopp et al, 2019; IPCC, WGII, 2022; Kirezci et al, 2020).  Climate projections for the coasts Internationally accepted scenarios of climate change constitute Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) - climate future projections based on GHG concentration trajectories. The RCPs and SSPs anticipate 2100 warming of 3.3°C to 5.7°C for the highest emission projection SSP5-8.5, of 2.1°C to 3.5°C under the intermediate SSP2-4.5, and of 1.0°C to 1.8°C under the lowest -SSP1-1.9 (IPCC, WGII, 2022). The Paris Agreement set the target of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 C, whereas current state of affair shows that we have surpassed this level. (Clark et al, 2016; C40, UCCRN, 2018; Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 19   19 UNFCCC, 2016). The estimates of sea level rise under those scenarios range from 26 to 178 cm by 2100 causing people and ecosystems to face higher coastal flood risks in upcoming decades (Bamber et al., 2019). Multiple additional studies have been conducted to enhance local projections under a broader array of changing natural conditions, such as ocean currents, topography, storm surge records etc. (Rutgers, 2020; NJDEP, 2020) The main coastal risks considered in research papers are increasing temperatures and melting glaciers at the poles, that contribute to sea level rise, intensify storm events, salinize aquifers, alter oceanic currents, manifest habitat loss, and Impact health (Clark et al, 2016; Kopp et al 2019; IPCC 6th, WGI, 2021; Cann et al, 2013). RCP8.5, or “Business as usual”, scenario implies that by 2100, the ratio of two main coastal risks affecting communities will be 68% of tide and storm events and 32% for the sea level rise. No protection will cause an increased exposure of 48% of the land area, 52% of population, and 46% of the assets. (Kirezci et al, 2020)  Risks caused by changing climate Physical impacts  Both human communities and ecosystems suffer from erosion, floods, and extreme precipitation altering the geophysics of coastal zones. Among the consequences of these damages are displacement, limited recovery capacity, migration, and fragmentation (IPCC 6th, WGI, 2021; Hsiang, Kopp, 2018). Coastal communities are susceptible to worsening hazards in general (UCCNR, 2018), with 10-13 % of the world population living in Low Elevation zones within 10 m of the sea (McGranahan et al., 2007). Moreover, socially vulnerable groups have considerably lower opportunities to recuperate after disasters, while the numbers of these projected episodic coastal flooding exposure will increase from 128–171 million to 176–287 million in 2100 under RCP8.5 (Kirezci et al, 2020). Beyond the health risks and property damage Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 20   20 striking those living next to the ocean, cross-contamination, infrastructural disruption, and community assets disruptions exacerbate the negative effects (Anderson, D. L., Ruggiero, P., Mendez, F. J., Barnard, P. L., Erikson, L. H., O’Neill, A. C., et al., 2021). Environmental risks The impacts on ocean life is observed on different scales, including ecosystem degradation, chemical and nutrient pollution, overharvesting of marine fauna, invasive species (IPCC, WGII, 2022). These aspects of climate change are explored by environmental science and supported by environmental groups such as the Nature Conservancy, UN Habitat, Restore America's Estuaries and many others. The research on the loss of habitats is building along with the realization of their value for human communities (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Arkema et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2020; Koch et al., 2009). Severe loss of coastal habitats is costly for communities in terms of ecosystem services, such as storm impacts reduction, carbon sequestration, and filtering runoff. Habitat restoration supports economies by providing opportunities for recreation and tourism. (Wharton, 2020). Fiscal stress The research reveals extensive financial risks for communities located within the coastal areas, with estimates from the $10s to $100s of billions annually by the end of this century (Neumann et al, 2021). Some papers focus on evaluating the areas projected to be chronically inundated, also involving the direct harm to the economies and ecosystems (UCSUSA, Spanger-Siegfried et al., 2017). Coastal storms cause infrastructure risk and damage that hinder evacuation routes, disrupt energy and water supply, and other vitally important city operations supporting communities and economies. The research evaluates global equivalents of an overall loss in the range from $ 8 billion to $14 billion in the case of no protection (Kirezci et al, 2020). Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 21   21 The risks for coastal properties are approximated as $7.4 B loss in value when compared to the homes located in the areas not exposed to the flood risks (Burgess & Rapoport, 2019). Part two. Coastal resilience Perspectives on resilience  The concept of resilience Resilience is commonly referred to as a system's adaptive capacity and ability to absorb external stress and reorganize to accommodate the change while keeping its identity and function (Holling, 1987, 2001; White,2010; Walker et al., 2004; Raymond et al., 2017). The climate-related definition introduces a city’s ability to prepare for the ongoing risks by minimizing social, environmental, and economic loss, and enhancing timely recovery in the aftermath of disasters (Levy, Herst, 2018). Three main characteristics of socio-ecological resilience include maintaining function, self-organization, and capacity to adapt (Oktari et al., 2020). Social, environmental, and economic vistas in coastal resilience Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed. Reducing it and boosting its adaptive capacity is an important goal of anticipatory resilience planning (Klein and Tol, 1997; Wiering et al., 2015). The literature notes the need for integrity of resilience dimensions and factors to enhance the performance and achieve a more comprehensive approach sought for the internal ability to withstand a disaster (Mileti 1999, Godschalk 2003, 2007; Lu, Stead, 2013). The social sciences view resilience through the lenses of communities’ essential needs, primarily focused on safety and welfare. This perception relegates the ecosystem side of this conflict to the background. The latest progress of the public awareness on the climate change brings the ecosystems into consideration as the major component of the broader array of resilience dimensions (Sutton-Grier et al., 2015; Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 22   22 Narayan et al., 2016; Wyatt et al., 2017). In addition to offering essential protection from hazards, ecosystems play a vital role in sustained natural balance and ecosystem values generation (Barnes and Virget, 2017; Hallegatte et al., 2013; Masselink & Lazarus, 2019; Wyatt et al., 2017). Critical coastal ecosystems  are threatened by both hard infrastructure and impacts from a changing climate (Defeo & McLachlan, 2005; Dugan et al., 2011; Guannel et al., 2015; Heady et al., 2018; Wedding et al., 2022). Coastal economies` resilience is affected by both the hazard threats and mismanagement of development and operation of the coastal areas. As such, research shows that the extensive economic growth creates considerable economic risks in the short term, in addition to the longer-term land loss and other climate-change induced damages (Reguero et al., 2014) Recovery, adaptation, and mitigation q Recovery planning policies are focused on the aftermath of a disaster. Having a recovery plan coordinates the actions in case an emergency happens. Such reactive approaches require minimal upfront investment, making it a common practice prior to our social understanding of climate change. Rehabilitation actions involve removal of debris, damage assessment, grant assistance applications, dwellings, utilities, and infrastructure reconstruction priorities, repair and re-occupancy, and temporary housing. (Berke & Campanella 2006; Schwab 2014; Johnson 2014b). The limitation of this approach is the growing probabilities of hazards and respective risks for communities (Alberini, Chiabai, and Muehlenbachs, 2006; Kelly and Adger, 2000; O'Brien, Sygna, and Haugen, 2004; Tol and Yohe, 2007; Yohe, 2000; Yohe and Tol, 2002).  Climate policies for the pre-disaster risks reduction can integrate adaptation and mitigation goals (Swart & Raes, 2007; Di Gregorio et al., 2017). Though the adaptation approach is becoming broadly practicable, it has the limitations of the low accountability for the future Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 23   23 climate changes reduction. Adaptation options are limited in capacities to offset climate change impacts on coastal ecosystems, but in the larger scale they can integrate mitigation measures (IPCC, WGII, 2022; Chausson et al., 2020; Baills et al., 2020). Mitigation approach is more strategically oriented on the long-term changes (Rose 2004b, 2007; Godschalk et al., 2009). It progressively reduces GHG emissions and other climate-related risks for the communities. It can involve relocation and retreat if these are the only available measures to enforce sustainable ecosystem and social balance.  Mitigation  Tools and regulation Land Use Planning is the major mitigation planning tool conducted mainly through strategic comprehensive planning (NRC, 2012; Godschalk, 2003; Berke et al., 2015). Mitigation approach is integrated in resilience plans pursuant to Disaster Mitigation Act , and is performed with the higher-level frameworks (DMA, 2000; IPCC, WGII AR5, Chapter 14.3 Table 14-1, Noble et al., 2014). The array of public funding discussed constitutes the major part in most mitigation measures (Levy & Herst, 2017) including direct grants , CAT funds, budgeting, and FEMA mitigation grants. The growing risk exposure means that the federal support may be insufficient in future years. Multiple researchers highlight the issues related to ample federal post-disaster funding (Burby et al.,1999, Godschalk et al. 1999). Few studies reported synergies or trade-offs between climate impact and GHG mitigation outcomes of ecosystems such as saltmarsh, created wetlands, and tropical and subtropical grasslands (Burden, Garbutt, & Evans, 2019; Ward et al., 2016). Grasslands store over 10% of terrestrial biomass carbon (Follett & Reed, 2010), and could sequester one billion tons of carbon annually (Smith et al., 2020). Moreover, they may be more reliable as carbon sinks than forests in regions facing increased Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 24   24 drought and wildfire risk and forest dieback because of increasing climate stress (Dass, Houlton, Wang, & Warlind, 2018; Allen et al., 2010; Chausson et al., 2020) Adaptation Sustainable approach considers the synergy of long-lasting economic, social, and environmental goals for communities’ welfare. Coastal adaptation planning generally follows four scenarios: protection, accommodation, retreat and no action (Vousdoukas et al., 2020). The factors defining resilience approaches are dictated by the GHG emissions, sequestration, federal and state legislation consequently dependent on the political climate in an area, communities’ priorities, and available resources (Tol et al., 2008; Berke et al., 2015; Kreibich et al., 2022). Among the various approaches to protect communities from SLR and coastal hazard risks are structural, social, and institutional approaches incorporating multiple resilience planning tools  (Peterson, 2019; Kousky et al., 2021; IPCC, WGII AR5, Chapter 14.3 Table 14-1, Noble et al., 2014). I further focus on the structural approaches to coastal protection as the category includes and provides alternatives to ecosystem-based protection. Modification of development: This approach is widespread due to its applicability to the cases of moderate but recurrent climate risks and a community`s will to keep the status quo. These include building codes and retrofits, flood insurance programs, tax incentives, flux zoning, and lower-impact development ordinances are supporting the shift towards less impactful and potentially less affected coastal zone development (Atlantic Coastal Storms Team, 2010; Baills et al., 2019; Kousky et al., 2021). Working with existing housing is a long and challenging process, while the planners must consider the tools for the future resilient development and use the post-disaster opportunities for updated zoning and development incentives (Godschalk et al., 2000). Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 25   25 Retreat Facilitated re-location, preservation and managed retreat are conducted through conservation and restoration of natural open spaces through buyouts, acquisitions, shoreline setbacks, rolling easements, and other zoning tools (Dyckman et al., 2014). Coastal retreat manifests an array of beneficial community uses and is preferred from an environmental resilience perspective. Floodable grass parks, wetlands, improved views, recreational functions are steering development away from the coast (Powell et al., 2019). Stabilization: Stabilization measures involve multiple tools to protect the coastal zone in its status quo preventing land loss and flooding in the short-term (Alberini, Chiabai, and Muehlenbachs, 2006; Kelly and Adger, 2000; O'Brien, Sygna, and Haugen, 2004; Tol and Yohe, 2007; Yohe, 2000; Yohe and Tol, 2002). This is the oldest approach to coastal planning as it evolved from the perception of nature as an adverse external power, using hard infrastructural barriers against the threat. It has evolved with the growing realization of essential balance between anthropogenic and ecosystem structures to provide sustained protection through nature-based solutions. The major rule to choose a proper approach from the Dutch practice is ‘hard when really necessary, soft where possible’ (Meulen et al., 2022). Dutch coastal management has been based on sand nourishment since the 90s, which is practiced to ‘hold the line’ to stop the erosion. (Meulen et al,. 2022). Generally, the European approach moves forward the NbS since 1980s. Hard infrastructure Engineered flood retention infrastructure - levees, groins, seawalls, breakwaters and storm surge barriers - were traditionally used before the mid-20th century, before their negative effects became apparent (Cooper et al. 2020; Pilkey et al., 2011; Pranzini and Williams, 2013). Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 26   26 Reliable and predictable on the one hand, they cause negative consequences over time of operation, specifically affecting vulnerable coastal ecosystems and adjacent communities. Hard constructions alter coastal zone configuration, tidal dynamics in the estuaries, marine and coastal habitats, and cause economic loss. (Leuven, Pierik et al, 2019; IPCC, 2022; FEMA, P-55, 2011; Gittman et al. 2016, Dethier et al. 2017, Powell et al. 2019; NRC 2007, Defeo et al. 2009).  Soft infrastructure Soft, or nature-based infrastructure, is distinguished from the natural landscapes in that it is built and maintained to provide the coastal flood protection while recreating local ecosystems (The International Institute for Sustainable Development, FEMA, 2019; Sutton-Grier et al., 2018). It both addresses the external challenges to the benefits for community welfare and ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity while being resilient in the face of climate change (Seddon et al., 2021; Seddon et al., 2020; Gillespie et al., 2014; Wedding et al., 2022).  Adaptation solutions with both hard and soft components - hybrid infrastructure – combine benefits of coastal habitats and system protection, as well as the adaptation to extreme storm events (Gittman et al. 2016, Dethier et al. 2017, Powell et al. 2019; Meulen et al., 2022). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers introduced the Engineering with Nature Initiative (USACE, 2019) to create multi-functional infrastructure for a broader range of economic, environmental, and social benefits. (FEMA, 2019). Even though NbS have multiple community and ecosystem benefits, a significant barrier to implementing the green versus gray infrastructure is its low predictability of the level of service under specific climate, economic, and social scenarios (FEMA, 2019; Meulen et al., 2022) Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 27   27 Part tree. Nature-based coastal adaptation strategies  Nature-based adaptation strategies  Shift from hard to soft The growing body of research related to coastal habitats restoration identifies both broader scientific and applied interest in and evidence of NbS implementation (Zhang et al., 2018; Bayraktarov et al., 2016; Smith et al., 2020). Coastal habitats provide a many ecosystem services including flood protection, eco resources, recreation, tourism, and carbon sequestration (Barbier et al., 2011; Mcleod et al., 2011; Scyphers et al., 2011; Silliman et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020). As noted previously, the shift from hard to soft infrastructure in European practice happened in the 1980-s with the Dutch Eastern Scheldt’s salt marshes ecosystem protection augmented with a storm surge barrier closing as the high tides approach (SAEIJS, 1982; Koningsveld et al., 2008). This transition from ‘Building in Nature’ to ‘Building with Nature’ brought a valuable alternative to the traditional approach. (Meulen et al., 2022; Ecoshape, 2020) Nature-based strategies The ecosystem-based approach has multiple names including nature-based solutions (World Bank 2018, Somarakis et al. 2019), building with nature (Waterman 1980, de Vriend and van Koningsveld 2012), green infrastructure (European Union 2013), natural- and nature-based features (Bridges et al. 2015) or ecological engineering (Borsje et al. 2011). Regardless of nomenclature, supporting principles are comprised of the natural elements that reduce flood risk, offer recreational and health benefits, and preserve ecological values for nature and humans (van der Meulen and van der Valk 2019; Meulen et al., 2022). The growing body of research proves the effectiveness of NbS in coastal flood risk reduction (Ferrario et al. 2014; Temmerman et al., 2013; Spalding et al., 2013; Reguero et al., 2014; Bridges, et al, 2021). The advantages of soft Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 28   28 solutions over the other measures are their conservation values, and many co-benefits including natural resource management and tourism (Groot et al. 2012; Meulen et al., 2022).  There are four major types of NbS approaches applicable for various habitats, including restoration, management, protection, and creation. Reclamation, or rehabilitation - a return to the pre-disturbance state – and the protection are the most beneficial for long-lasting ecosystem and cultural values. Creation and management involve artificial landscapes, including agriculture and farming (Shiao et al, 2020; (University of Oxford, 2019; IUCN, 2012).  Federal emergency management agency`s (FEMA`s) local governments guide provides the major types of nature-based solutions at different scales and purposes. The categories are (1) watershed or landscape scale long-term practices, (2) neighborhood or site scale (relatively compact stormwater management), and (3) coastal NbS aimed to stabilize and buffer the shoreline from storm risks. The latter is realized through a combination of natural and structural elements, such as the coastal wetlands, oyster reefs, vegetated dunes, waterfront parks, and living shorelines (FEMA, 2019). The NbS`s major types of habitats are estimated to considerably reduce the loss. As such, coastal wetlands reduced Hurricane Sandy fiscal and physical flood damage by $625 Million depending on the size and robustness of the vegetation (Narayan et al., 2017). Another meta-study of the five habitats has shown they are attenuating wave heights between 35% and 71% - salt -marshes by 72%, coral reefs by 70%, seagrass/kelp beds by 36%, and mangroves by 31%. (Narayan et al., 2016). Hybrid coastal protection strategies  The hybrid approaches derived from the Dutch practice are also known as “building with nature” and “Living with water” (Ecoshape, 2020; Powell et al., 2019; Vriend et al., 2014; de Vriend and van Koningsveld, 2012; Aiken et al., 2014).  These strategies combine natural Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 29   29 habitats and engineered systems to realize their benefits, such as combination of levees and wetlands, or the bulkheads and ripraps or oysterbeds (USACE, 2019; USACE Nationwide Permit for Living Shorelines; the Living Shorelines Act, 2019; NOAA, 2015). They have the high potential to provide the triple-bottom line of benefits that support coastal habitats (Currin et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2015; Gittman et al., 2016b), community resilience (Manis et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2018), and cost effectiveness (Smith et al., 2017, 2018). Although, this approach needs to bring more attention to ecosystem values (Palmer et al., 2014; Smith et al., 2020).  Suitability - human and ecosystem factors of allocation  The latest knowledge on the NbS is aggregated in the International Guidelines prepared by USACE and international team of researchers (Bridges et al., 2022). The recommendations consider multiple factors that inform ecosystem-based adaptation decisions, with particular focus on their performance and endurance. These are the environmental conditions such as vegetation types, elevations, nearshore bathymetry, wave height, water levels, and aspects such as the wetland elevation and configuration. Human factors such as the shoreline embankments, infrastructural, and land use practices are less explored in relation to NbS allocation. They are mainly referred to when prioritizing adaptation measures or analyzing the effects of adaptation infrastructure on the coastal hydrodynamics. As such, inlets and exposure to the fetch affect surge‑attenuation most considerably (Lawler, Haddad, and Ferreira 2016), whereas the structured solutions may cause wave refraction and scouring (Morton and Barras 2011). Native ecosystems The nature-based solutions should follow the natural patterns of an area to enforce sustainability of ecosystems. South Carolina shore is a lowland inhabited with wetland ecosystems. Coastal wetlands are found in intertidal zones on all continents except Antarctica. Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 30   30 Salt marshes dominate in temperate regions, while mangrove forests are prevalent in the tropics and subtropics. Inland, salt marshes give way to brackish and tidal freshwater wetlands. Coastal wetlands occur in low-to-moderate wave-energy settings with relatively low slope and are common along inland coasts and estuarine shorelines on soft and unconsolidated sediments, which allows vegetation to trap fine sediment particles and prevent resuspension (Bridges et al., 2021b). Grain size tends to decrease landward due to decreasing tidal energy. Brackish and freshwater wetlands have lower salinity and are found in the upper reaches of tidal influence. They are more diverse than salt marshes and mangroves, but species diversity varies by location. Tidal flats, which are adjacent to wetlands, help dissipate wave energy and play a crucial role in sediment exchanges during storms.  Performance of the NbS  No comprehensive assessment yet exists Currently there is no sufficient method of assessing the suitable conditions and the respective effects of ecosystem-based protection. The NbS are still not broadly implemented, and the factors of a site suitability for allocating them are yet to be determined based on monitoring and modeling. (Bridges et al, 2021b) Measuring the status of resilience The research on resilience assessment suggests that evaluation for the adaptation actions should consider the four key parameters of actions proposed: equity, effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (Adger, Arnell, and Tompkins, 2004; Lorie et al., 2001; Fankhauser et al., 1999; Burton et al., 2002). Indeed, most of the high-level evaluation frameworks are based on these principles of assessment of various resilience parameters. These are four major systems of evaluation - City Resilience Framework (CRF), UNISDR City Resilience Scorecard, Climate Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 31   31 and Disaster Resilience Index (CDRI), and NOAA Coastal Community Resilience Guide (Rose, 2007; UNISDR, 2017). UNISDR City Resilience Scorecard is one of the broad-accepted systems of tracing the progress towards resilience (NRC, 2012) criteria of management and financing, planning and disaster preparedness, hazard response ability to recover (UNISDR, 2009; UNISDR, 2017). The authors analyzed and compared their validity to generate an upgraded evaluation tool with the criteria of governance, socio-economic, resource management, land use and infrastructure, and mitigation strategies, with development of resilience plans and policies nested under the umbrella of the institutional parameter (Oktari et al., 2020).  Among the other ways to measure resilience there are social, physical, economic, institutional, natural, and disaster recovery indicators (Rubinoff & Courtney, 2007; Shaw et al., 2010; UNDRR, 2017). Most of the frameworks emphasize the importance of a comprehensive plan in pursuing the resilience of a community. The limitations of these frameworks is the focus on physical and demographic characteristics as a static variable which need to be fixed with the scenario-based approach (de Ruig et al., 2013; Kousky, 2014).  Evaluation of the adaptation measures  Measuring Nature-based protection capacity involves an array of factors such as biophysical, market and non-market economic values, qualitative wellbeing impacts, and social and institutional results. Depending on the goal, the models of NbS evaluation are subdivided into risk exposure reduction, biophysical effects, economic effects, livelihood and wellbeing, social and administrative outcomes (BMUB, Emerton, 2017). The major criteria are effectiveness of the capacity to achieve a goal of sustained reduction of risk, and efficiency of resources invested (Jones, 2001;  Ingham and Ulph, 2003), in terms of costs and benefits of both reduced impacts or enhanced opportunities (Adger, Arnell, Tompkins, 2004). The damage Clemson CRP. Thesis research. Doctor C. Dyckman. Prepared by Ok.Veselkova 32   32 reduction needed to assess the effectiveness include direct physical damage and indirect market and economic losses in the local or regional scale (Costanza et al., 2008). These categories added with private- public costs and benefits of actions and compared with no action scenario provide the basis for economic efficiency evaluation of the adaptation strategy (Adger, Arnell, Tompkins, 2004).  Ecosystem performance  An adaptation solution should focus on performance aspects that are controlled within the design, such as vegetation types and surface elevations. Further optimization of the FRM (Flood Risk Management) functions of an ecosystem can be adjusted based on the specific settings and design storm characteristics. Flow reduction, waves, and surge attenuation that wetlands provide are related to vegetation parameters such as height, density, flexibility, and roots ratio. The platform elevation, tidal channel inlets and other structural parameters are easier to control. Storm and geomorphic characteristics are also affecting attenuation performance of ecosystems. The assessment of these effects is based on observation and modeling. (Bridges et al., 2021 b).  Observation-based metrics NNBF guides
