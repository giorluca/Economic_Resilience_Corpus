Economic resilience and concentration in Indiana over 2002-2016

zzDiversity and Economic Performance in Indiana from 2002 to 2016Santiago Ruiz, Michael Wilcox and Indraneel KumarIntroduction Economic shocks affect long term patterns of economic growth. For this reason, understanding the mechanisms that can enhance economic performance will be useful for regional economies. This research aims to  show the role of economic diversity in Indiana during the Great Recession of 2008-2009.Research Questions• What was the economic performance of Indiana’s counties during the Great Recession?• Does economic diversity play a role during economic downturns?Methods Variables Drop ReboundCoefficient St. Error Coefficient St. ErrorSpatial Lag -0.10 0.11 -0.09 0.14Constant -1476.50 2083.83 -2447.04 1089.80PCHHI -238.75** 83.03 49.36 1.13Manufac.Index 764.94 626.54 138.43 0Age 25-34 -0.21 10.01 0.05** 0A.Earnings 0.00 0.02 0.0038** 0.00Area 15399.30 11811.90 -6696.02 6184.76R squared 0.64 0.441.

Specifically in Metro and Non-Core counties.Counties in the former areas have become more diversified but it is due to the fact that they lost jobs in sectors that were highly concentrated.Using two digits North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) we assembled a database with annual number of jobs for Indiana’s counties from 2000 to 2016.1.Hans and Goetz, Economic resilience in U.S (2015)2.

However,greater the degree of diversity of a givencounty, less the Drop, that is the number oflayoffs during a recession.ReferencesChart 1. HHI over timeEmail: johsruizmor@unal.edu.coConclusionso PCHHI is the first principal component for HHI over time. It captures around 95 % of the variance.o Spatial Lag coefficient refers to the parameter 𝜸𝜸 in equation 4.o We added the following variables into the regression model: Manufacturing Index that could be 1 or 0, Area of every county, Average Earnings per worker in our frame of time, and average of people aged 25-34.
