Celetti University of Padua, Padua, Italy;   david.celetti@unipd.itABSTRACTRelevance. The paper analyzes the development of Vicenza’s jewelry indus-try with a focus on the region’s resilience to external shocks and on the role that firms’ spatial concentration plays in the way territories respond to crises. The proposed analysis can provide entrepreneurs, managers, and public de-cision-makers with new insights into how firms’ location patterns influence economic development. Research Objectives. The purpose of this research is to test empirically the correlation between firms’ concentration, and resilience to external shocks. Data and Methods. The study uses the statistical data on the number of em-ployees and active firms within the selected territory provided by Infocamere (Information Society of Italian Trade Chambers) over the last 20 years (2000–2021). These data are used to trace the localization of firms with the help of concentration indexes. By comparing the above-mentioned data, the study tests the correlation between firms’ concentration levels, the sector’s economic performance, and the reaction of territories to external shocks.Results. Territories with high concentration levels of firms working in the same sector perform better than other territories. Moreover, territorial con-centration increases during and after any adverse external shock. These results are consistent with the research evidence, stressing the relevance of Marshalli-an-like districts for sharing practices, technology, know-how, access to infor-mation, institutional links. These factors, in turn, enhance firms’ resilience to external shocks. Conclusions. The results provide a new understanding of how firms’ location schemes can affect sustainable territorial development.KEYWORDSindustrial districts, resilience, Italian economy, economic history, regional economy, local development, jewelry production, SMEs, entrepreneurshipAKNOWLEDGEMENTSThe research was supported by the project “The Economy of Excellence.

R-economy, 8(4), 384–395. doi: 10.15826/recon.2022.8.4.029IntroductionJewelry production in Vicenza boasts centu-ries-old tradition. Crafts and artisanship emerged in Roman times and, after a period of decline during the Early and High Middle Ages, they came to a revival in the period of the early Italian Re-naissance. The foundation of the city’s goldsmiths’ guild, in 1339, opened a new phase of growth. Vicenza’s elegant, refined and high-quality prod-ucts were exported to major markets, including Venice. The 17th century marked a new turning point in the sector’s history, opening an age of al-most three centuries-long stagnation. The expan-sion of textile and then mechanical manufactu- ring absorbed investments and personnel. Skills, know-how, and tradition, however, were not lost, and constituted the foundation for the new period of growth starting after the Italian unification.At the end of the 19th century, the sector star- ted to evolve, moving away from manufacturing luxurious, artisan-like jewelry to more affordable items. Mechanization and standardization al-lowed the creation of medium-quality gold, and silver collections. Local firms successfully targeted larger groups of potential customers. The num-ber of firms as well as the sector’s turnover grew 386 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2022, 8(4), 384–395 doi: 10.15826/recon.2022.8.4.029Online ISSN 2412-0731consistently, and jewelry production emerged again as a key industry of the provincial econo-my. The number of firms and the sector’s turnover grew consistently. This pattern was somehow re-produced in the 1950s, when, after the crisis of the late 1930s and the war, local entrepreneurs further industrialized production processes, tak-ing advantage of the Italian economic boom. At first, they addressed the domestic demand, re-sponding to the needs and fancies of ever larger middles classes. By the 1960s, local entrepreneurs also turned to foreign markets. The United States, Germany andEuropean countries such as France, Holland and England, started buying increasing quantities of Vicenza jewelry. Enlarged produc-tion determined both the sector’s further expan-sion and its internal reorganization. Major com-panies with international clients focused on the strategic knots of the value chain, such as design and marketing, while smaller firms concentrated on niches or worked as subcontractors. Subcon-tracting, in particular, became structural, which in turn contributed to the emergence of a gal-axy of shops specializing in separate stages of the supply chain or in side production and services (Crestanello, 1997). The sector’s configuration ac-quired then the traits of an industrial district (see (Becattini, 1990)). The above-mentioned trends are mirrored by firms’ location. Jewelry production consolidat-ed in Vicenza, the province’s capital, in Bassano del Grappa, on the north-eastern side of the pro- vince, and in Trissino, in the north-western part (figure 1). The sector became more complex. The above mentioned areas, in particular, developed to some extent autonomously. Vicenza retained its high-level, artisan-like production and mer-chandizing; Trissino focused on standardization and mechanization; Bassano del Grappa followed hybrid paths, combining traditional jewelry and manufacturing of such items as medals, sports cups, trophies or religious accessories. Apart from the competition, territories also established co-operative relationships. Similar links were estab-lished by small and bigger companies. Little shops worked for a few contractors, sometimes just one, but maintained multifaced relationships with oth-er shops. At the time of the peak demand, for ex-ample, orders were redistributed among local pro-ducers mostly through informal networks built on personal relationships, kinship, and friendship. In 1951-1971, the sector consolidated and, as a result of the influence of economic, social and cul-tural factors, an industrial district emerged within the territorial boundaries of several municipalities, as conceptualized by Becattini (Becattini, 1990). Meanwhile, in the same period, Vicenza’s jewelry production enjoyed a steady growth. The number of firms increased from 40 to 395 and employees from 800 to 5,000 (Thomsen, 2022; Vi-tantonio, 2022). The “golden age” of Vicenza’s jewelry ended abruptly in the mid-1970s: 1973 and 1979 oil shocks were accompanied by a sharp increase in the prices for precious metals, by global econo- mic stagnation, causing an increase in production costs while the demand was falling. Even after re-covering, markets didn’t return to previous stable growth patterns. Increased volatility, demand’s fluctuations, and high gold prices contributed to the complex and difficult economic context. Many firms were pushed out of the market and the sector shrank significantly. The process, however, had also positive sides. The surviving firms were searching for new production and marketing approaches, they sought to enhance their productivity and pro-duction quality, fought for acquiring new markets and clients. They invested in communication, with the aim of exploiting tangible and intangible val-ues, such as local culture and history, linking their products to the world-wide diffused imaginary of Italian and Venetian traditions of high quality, elegance, and sophistication. They created brands to reach visibility at the global level. The district gradually acquired its current features.The number of active firms was sharply re-duced, but the remaining companies showed grea- ter dynamism than in the previous decades. In par-ticular they enhanced products’ quality, looked for innovative approaches in design and customiza-tion, they exploited tangible and intangible values transmitted by loca tradition, history, and culture, they created brands commercialized at global level. Nowadays, despite the substantial decrease in the number of active firms and employees, Vicenza’s jewelry industry maintains its position as a core economic sector at the regional and national level. Given these premises, the research’s objective is to test the hypothesis of the existence of positive correlations between the level of jewelry firms’ concentration calculated for the municipal level and the degree of the industry’s resilience to exter-nal shocks, using as a proxy the differences of the variation in the number of active companies and employees in areas characterized by different de-grees of firms’ concentration. The research focus-R-ECONOMY, 2022, 8(4), 384–395 doi: 10.15826/recon.2022.8.4.029387 r-economy.comOnline ISSN 2412-0731es on the period of 2000–2021, characterized by market transformations and external shocks such as the European Monetary Unification (2000), the economic crisis of 2008, the sharp increase in the prices for precious metals in 2008–2013 and 2019–2021, and the pandemic. Theoretical FrameworkVicenza’s jewelry history has been widely dis-cussed as a case study to illustrate the ability of an industrial sector structured within three in-terrelated Marshallian districts (Vicenza, Trissino and Bassano del Grappa – Fig. 1) to benefit from market opportunities and overcome an economic crisis through processes of adaptation (Beccattini, 1990; Becattini, 2003; Rebellotti, 2007; Economia e Società Regionale, 2017). The mechanization and standardization processes of the 1950s and 1960s was the answer to the booming demand of the post-war years (Gaggio, 2002; Gaggio, 2006; Gaggio, 2007, 128-153). Each of the three districts was built within the hierarchical frameworks around the major companies that controlled stra-tegic knots of the value chain (design, refinishing, marketing, and merchandising). Smaller busi-nesses worked on marginal production or as sub-contractors, adding flexibility and complexity to the industry between the 1960s and early 1970s. As part of these trends, both contractors and sub-contractors established long-term relations with major international buyers, enlarging the volume of production and opening a window to export markets (De Marchi, 2014; Simoni, 2010).The oil shock of 1973, rising gold prices (Fig. 2) and the economic transformations of the early 21st century caused a new wave of compet-itive selection within the district: the number of active firms decreased significantly in the 1970s Figure 1.

Meanwhile, the crisis forced to accelerate modernization, a process marked by the increasing attention to quality, the use of wid-er range of precious metals, innovative approach-es to design, customization, and brand manage-ment (Jiayu, 2018; Leszczynska, 2018).388 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2022, 8(4), 384–395 doi: 10.15826/recon.2022.8.4.029Online ISSN 2412-0731Once again, the territory and the exploita-tion of its intangible values within “experience- economy” approaches proved to be an effective marketing tool. Methods and DataThe paper tests the correlation between the index of concentration of jewelry firms calcula- ted at the municipal level and the variation of the number of companies and employees in the same area from 2000 to 2021. This approach allows us to check whether firms working in the contexts characterized by the presence of a high number of companies operating in the same sector (high concentration level) better react to external shocks than those showing lower concentration.The concentration index is calculated by com-paring the proportion of the chosen parameter, in our case the number of firms in a single municipali- ty, with the value of the same parameter at the pro-vincial level (Guarini, 1996; Pinkovetskaya, 2015). 00 00/,/ih iihhA AQA A= (1)Qih is the concentration index of the jewelry industry in municipality i; Aih is the number of active firms operating in the jewelry sector in mu-nicipality i; Ai0 = ΣhAih is the total number of ac-tive firms operating in municipality i; A0h = Σi Aih is the total number of companies operating in the jewelry sector in all the municipalities in the Province of Vicenza; A0h = Σi Aih, is the total num-ber of firms operating in all the municipalities in the Province of Vicenza.If a municipality presents Qih values higher than one, the share of companies operating in the jewelry sector in that territory is higher than the provincial average indicating economic spe-cialization. Qih values below the unit reflect the opposite situation. Given the development and relative industrial diversification of the Province of Vicenza, high Qih can be reasonably associated with cluster-like conditions1. The data have been taken from the Register of Companies provided by InfoCamere (Italian Chambers of Commerce Information Compa-1 Data refers to the ATECO 2002 codes of activity 36,21,0; 36,22,1-36,22,2; 33,50,0p-36,61,0 for  2000–2008, and ATECO 2007 C32.1 (32,11,0; 32,12,1; 32,11,2; 31,13,0) for 2009-2021 identifying firms engaged in manufacturing of coins and med-als, jewelry, jewelry and related articles, and in the processing of precious stones. To calculate these indexes, we considered only the companies with both a shop and a registered office within the same municipality.ny. The Register identifies firms operating in the manufacture of coins and medals, jewelry, jewelry and related articles, and in processing of precious stones. To calculate the indexes, we considered only the companies with both a shop and regis-tered office within the same municipality.The period of time chosen for the analysis encompasses a number of important events for the Italian economy as the European Monetary unification; the economic crisis of 2008–2013; and the first pandemic shocks of February 2020. It  was also marked by a long-term rise of gold prices. It appears therefore particularly significant to test the resulting correlation between industrial concentration and resilience to external negative shocks.Results and DiscussionAt the moment Vicenza’s jewelry industrial district is undergoing far-reaching transforma-tions. In the province, the economic downturn caused a 59% decrease in the number of employ-ees and 30% decrease in the number of companies in 2000–20212. The trend is all the more serious because it follows the 2008–2010 crisis, which had already brought to an abrupt end the 2000–2005 expansion (+1.54% of employees and +32.47%)3. As a consequence, since 2005–2010, the sec-tor has shown an overall negative trend, which continued in the subsequent years4. Small and me-dium-sized firms suffered more than larger ones (–2,5 versus –1.9 as a five-year average), which seems to confirm the significance of the firm’s size for its ability to respond to markets’ uncer-tainty5. The number of active firms (–9.87%) and employees (–10.04%), as well as the average num-ber of employees per firm declined in the two de-cades, falling from 18.96 in 2000 to 9.20 in 2021. Within this generally negative picture, there were, however, some positive aspects, for example, 2 Confartigianato Vicenza (2020).

By this way we formed four sets of municipalities. Groups A and B, with Qih > 3 and 2 ≤ Qih ≤ 2.99 re-spectively, included municipalities with very high and high concentration indexes. Group C en-compassed municipalities with average quotient (1 ≤ Qih ≤ 1.99). Finally, group D included mu-nicipalities with low indexes (0.50 ≤ Qih ≤ 0.99). Municipalities with Qih lower than 0.50 were not considered. The calculation of the concentration indexes covered five-year periods (2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2021).

The group with Qih between 1 and 1.99 lost only 4 municipa- lities in 20 years, and the group with Qih between 0.5 and 0.90 lost 8. Areas with high concentration indexes are therefore more stable and resilient than others because they have lost less firms. We also observe that regarding the polariza-tion of jewelry production, there are significant differences between the municipalities. Trissi-no maintains the highest concentration level throughout the whole period but its companies’ activities do not go beyond the boundaries of this municipality. In other words, it does not perform, at least in the twenty-year period covered by our research, any leading role in the sector’s develop-ment behind the municipality’s boundaries and does not lead to the involvement of adjacent areas in its core business. The situation in Vicenza and, to a lesser ex-tent, in Bassano is quite different. Almost all the municipalities bordering the provincial capital have been attracted into jewelry production and present remarkably high concentration index-es. The same can be said for Bassano del Grap-pa, where, though at lower levels than in Vicenza, jewelry spreads beyond the borders of single mu-nicipalities. Such differentiation appears substan-tially consistent with the historical formation of the three jewelry poles. Vicenza, as we have seen, boasts an ancient tradition of jewelry production. The industry has expanded progressively into the surrounding areas through imitative, and subcon-tracting processes. Bassano’s production is more recent and does not appear specifically linked to the city and its specific urban context, which might explain why it goes beyond the municipa- lities’ boundaries. Trissino’s district emerged in the mid-1950s as a result of the transformation of mechanical shops into jewelry ones mainly at the initiative of former workers of firms operating in Vicenza’s jewelry production. The sector’s further development was determined by the success of these first-comers, of their subcontracting strate- gies mainly based on local personal and family networks. These aspects explain why the cluster is still rooted in one municipality and has not moved beyond its borders. Finally, the stability of municipalities showing high specialization rates within the general con-text marked by a long-term crisis, mirrored, as we have seen, by the reduction in the number of employees and active firms, suggests that the ter-ritory still represents a valuable source of compe- titive advantage, compensating for adverse mar-ket transformations. This conclusion is confirmed by the worse performance of firms belonging to group D (low concentration) in comparison with groups A, B and C (Tables 6–12).Table 6 Indicators Territorial Groups – Percentage Variation 2000–2005 Employees Number of Firms Average number of employees per firmAverage Concentration IndexGroup A (I.C. >3.0) 5.96 58.51 –33.15 6.51Group B (I.C. between and 2.0 e 2.99) 44.81 63.95 –11.68 1.36Group C (I.C. between and a 1.0 e 1.99) –3.97 27.03 –24.40 –10.01Group D (I.C between and 0.5 e 0.99) –31.41 –54.29 50.03 –4.49Source: The author’s calculations are based on the Unioncamere-Infocamere dataTable 7Indicators Territorial Groups – Percentage Variation 2005–2010Employees Number of Firms Average number of employees per firmAverage Concentration IndexGroup A (I.C. >3.0) –42.19 –33.82 –12.65 1.36Group B (I.C. between and 2.0 e 2.99) –44.38 –28.37 –22.35 6.46Group C (I.C. between and 1.0 e 1.99) –45.95 –41.70 –7.28 8.72Group D (I.C. between and 0.5 e 0.99) 36.39 71.88 –20.65 13.51Source: The author’s calculations are based on the Unioncamere-Infocamere data392 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2022, 8(4), 384–395 doi: 10.15826/recon.2022.8.4.029Online ISSN 2412-0731Table 8Indicators Territorial Groups – Percentage Variation 2010–2015 Employees Number of Firms Average number of employees per firmAverage Concentration IndexGroup A (I.C. >3.0) –27.02 –17.69 –11.33 0.74Group B (I.C. between and 2.0 e 2.99) –36.49 –40.59 6.90 3.99Group C (I.C. between and 1.0 e 1.99) –17.99 5.11 –21.98 –1.79Group D (I.C. between and 0.5 e 0.99) –74.63 –50.91 –48.31 –19.65Source: The author’s calculations are based on the Unioncamere-Infocamere dataTable 9Indicators Territorial Groups – Percentage Variation 2015–2021  Employees Number of Firms Average number of employees per firmAverage Concentration IndexGroup A (I.C. >3.0) –10.01 –12.84 3.25 0.36Group B (I.C. between and 2.0 e 2.99) –19.44 –6.67 –13.68 –7.52Group C (I.C. between and 1.0 e 1.99) –71.66 –62.50 –24.44 6.77Group D (I.C. between and 0.5 e 0.99) –89.71 –4.07 –60.29 14.84Source: The author’s calculations are based on the Unioncamere-Infocamere dataTable 10Indicators Territorial Groups – Percentage Variation 2000–2021Employees Number of Firms Average number of employees per firmAverage Concentration IndexGroup A (I.C. >3.0) –59.77 –24.74 –46.54 9.14Group B (I.C. between and 2.0 e 2.99) –58.79 –34.88 –36.71 3.77Group C (I.C. between and 1.0 e 1.99) –87.94 –70.81 –58.68 2.59Group D (I.C. between and 0.5 e 0.99) –97.56 –90.00 –75.57 0.03Source: The author’s calculations are based on the Unioncamere-Infocamere dataTable 11 Homogeneous Territorial Groups – Average Index Concentration 2000–2021 111A (>3) B (2-2.99) C (1-1.99) D (0.5-0.99)TRISSINO/5.41 CAMISANO/2.96 VICENTINOMUSSOLEN-TE/1.74VI012 – BASSANO D.G./1.53 ZUGLIANO/0.74 LUGO DI V./0.91TORRI d.

Data clearly show that classes A and B (high and medium-high concentration) perform better in all the selected parameters. Such outcomes are further confirmed if we focus on the municipalities that remained in the same group from 2000 to 2021. The analysis that deals in this case with completely homogeneous classes totally confirms the above-mentioned re-sults (Tables 11-12). our data highlights that con-centration levels tend to grow during and after the crisis. Both findings are consistent with the scien-tific literature stressing the relevance of industrial districts for firms’ resilience to external shocks.ConclusionsThe study confirms our initial hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between con-centration patterns and economic performance, which was measured by using the number of active firms and employees as proxies. This evi-dence appears in line with the results of scientif-ic literature on industrial districts, which consi- ders proximity and concentration as elements of strength. This study represents the first step in broader research that may be continued to verify the resi- lience to external shocks of sub-sectorial compo-nents and explore the differences between single branches of the jewelry industry. The level of in-vestigation could also be disaggregated from that of “homogeneous areas by concentration index” to more analytical levels, e.g. a single municipa- lity or single area within one municipality, or, on the opposite, it could consider spaces with similar production patterns that transcend municipality boundaries. Further research may also include analysis of other sectors, and, if viewed from the comparative perspective, other Italian, European and non-European regions.ReferencesAparicio-Pérez, D. et al.
