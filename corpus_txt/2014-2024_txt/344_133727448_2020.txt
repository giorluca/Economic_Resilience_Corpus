Just a few energy recovery systemsare currently installed in PRSs and are mostly composed of radial turboexpanders coupled withcogeneration internal combustion engines or gas-fired heaters providing the necessary preheating.This paper clarifies the reason for the scarce diffusion of energy recovery systems in PRSs and providesguidelines about the most feasible energy recovery technologies. Nine thousand PRSs are monitoredand allocated into 12 classes, featuring different expansion ratios and available power. The focus ison PRSs with 1-to-20 expansion ratio and 1-to-500 kW available power. Three kinds of expandersare proposed in combination with different preheating systems based on boilers, heat pumps,or cogeneration engines. The goal is to identify, for each class, the most feasible combination bylooking at the minimum payback period and maximum net present value. Results show that smallsize volumetric expanders with low expansion ratios and coupled with gas-fired heaters have thehighest potential for large-scale deployment of energy recovery from PRSs. Moreover, the totalrecoverable energy using the feasible recovery systems is approximately 15% of the available energy.Keywords: energy recovery; natural gas distribution network; natural gas expander; natural gasengineering; economic analysis1. IntroductionThe natural gas network is designed to achieve an acceptable compromise between cost ofinfrastructure and cost of the energy spent to pressurize the gas. To reduce the volume of pipelines andmake the transportation efficient, the natural gas is compressed before the injection in the distributionnetwork [1]. However, just a small fraction of the pressure energy of the natural gas is effectivelyutilized to keep it in motion while the rest is usually wasted in pressure reduction stations (PRSs). Thesestations subdivide the distribution network into subsystems working at decreasing pressure levels asthe gas gets closer to the final users. For instance, the maximum distribution pressure for domestic unitsis 0.04 barg, whereas it ranges from 8 barg to 0.04 barg for industrial users and energy conversion plants.To guarantee the availability of natural gas at the various extraction points and make the interactionpossible between subsystems operating at different pressure levels, the natural gas network is equippedwith various pressure reduction stations (PRSs). In these stations, the pressure drop of the natural gasis obtained by means of simple and reliable throttling valves, which perform an isenthalpic processwithout any extraction of work. Alternatively, energy recovery technologies can be used to exploit theenergy associated with the pressure drop for power generation. The scientific literature agrees thatone of the most feasible energy recovery technologies for PRSs is the radial turboexpander-generator.Energies 2020, 13, 4453; doi:10.3390/en13174453 www.mdpi.com/journal/energiesEnergies 2020, 13, 4453 2 of 19However, this machine is quite expensive (also because it generally requires a gearbox) and, therefore,becomes more convenient as the size increases. Real installations of radial-turboexpander generatorshave worked profitably for years in several countries (e.g., in the US [2], UK [3], and Italy [4,5]).However, the number of installed machines is still relatively modest. Recently, a few authors proposedvolumetric expanders instead of the traditional radial ones because of the lower cost and higherrobustness. These features start to become increasingly important as the size of the energy systemdecreases and, for very small sizes, it may become necessary to pay off the investment costs inreasonably short periods. Diao et al. [6] developed a prototype of a screw expander working withnatural gas between 8 barg and 2 barg, finding an isentropic efficiency of about 70%. Howard et al. [7]studied an energy recovery solution including a small size radial turboexpander coupled to fuel cellsfor preheating and working between 6 barg and 2 barg. They found an averaged isentropic efficiencyof the expander of about 68%. Yao et al. [8] carried out a study on the performance of a twin-screwexpander as power generation unit working with natural gas between average pressures of 8 bargand 2 barg. They found that the expander could reach isentropic efficiencies of about 70% at designconditions, which decrease to 35% at off-design conditions. Yaxuan et al. [9] considered the energyrecovery from a natural gas network with a single-screw expander coupled with a heat pump toprovide the energy needed for preheating. The expander works both as power generation unit andpressure regulation device between 6 barg and 1 barg, and shows an isentropic efficiency rangingbetween 90% and 40%. Tian et al. [10] developed a mathematical model to predict the performance ofa single-screw expander employed in steam pressure pipelines to recover energy from the pressuredrop (7 barg – 1 barg) during intermittent operating conditions. They found that the maximumisentropic efficiency fluctuates between 73 and 83%. Barbarelli et al. [11] developed a prototypeof an innovative volumetric expander to recover energy from natural gas from a pressure drop of3.5 – 1 barg with a maximum achievable isentropic efficiency of about 40%. Kolansky et al. [12]conducted a thermodynamic analysis on rolling piston expanders adopted to recover the pressureenergy of natural gas. They found that the expander was able to achieve an isentropic efficiency ofabout 60% working with expansion ratio of 2. Some works deal with the optimization of reciprocatingpiston expanders using exergy analysis in energy recovery applications in natural pressure reductionstations [13,14]. They all suggest that this expansion system could have a high potential in the proposedapplication. As imposed by the Italian legislation, most of the expander installations require thepreheating of natural gas before the expansion process. This avoids the undesired condensation ofgas hydrates that could damage pipelines and other components of the network but, in contrast,it reduces the advantages of gas expanders in terms of energy efficiency. Thermal oil or water heatersare employed as gas preheaters because of the relatively low cost. However, numerous works in theliterature propose the utilization of different strategies to manage the preheating and increase the totalefficiency of the system, such as:(1) Using a solar thermal storage [15] or low-temperature thermal sources deriving from industrialprocesses and renewables [16,17].(2) Coupling (e.g., [18]) heat pumps with the turboexpander electric generator to invest part of theelectricity generated by recovery for preheating.(3) Utilizing the cold thermal energy available at the end of the expansion process for industrial ordomestic users [19] or as a cold source for power plants [20].(4) Using cogenerative (CHP) internal combustion engines (ICEs) to supply the thermal poweroutput for gas preheating and produce an additional electric power output [21].In any case, the electricity generated by the expander-generator can be sent to the grid, used forpreheating, or stored in the gas network as hydrogen [19,22,23].It is evident that this field represents an active research area in which a wide range of possibleenergy recovery solutions can be applied to PRSs. However, real applications are still very limiteddespite the stricter policies for energy saving adopted recently in several countries. In this context,Energies 2020, 13, 4453 3 of 19some questions arise: Why is the energy recovery from PRSs in natural gas distribution networkrarely proposed? Is it a matter of costs or efficiency? Are there one or more energy recovery solutionsthat could be feasible for a diffuse application to a large number of PRSs? How much energy can berecovered with acceptable costs and efficiency?The goal of this paper is to answer these questions by identifying the most economically feasibleenergy recovery solutions that could be employed in various “classes” of pressure reduction stationsfeaturing different expansion ratios and annual-averaged available power. The energy recoverysolutions considered in the economic evaluations were selected from among 12 commercially availablesystems including an expander-generator coupled to a natural gas preheating system. Available dataof a large sample (9000 PRSs) of real PRSs in the Italian gas distribution network were utilized toperform the analysis and eventually to calculate the amount of energy that could be recovered utilizingthe energy recovery solutions indicated by the results of the economic evaluation. The wide sample ofPRSs, and the various expansion ratios and flow rates of these PRSs, made the results general andapplicable also to other gas distribution networks.2.

The connection with Sicily Island is guaranteed by four Marine Terminals connecting the submarine pipelines to the onshore ones in Mazara del Vallo (Trapani), Messina, Favazzina (Reggio Calabria), and Palmi (Reggio Calabria).

The total storage capacity is about 16 billion m3 and is realized in exhaustedunderground deposits. Both the storage capacity and the LNG injection points are planned to beincreased in the next few years.3. MethodsThe methodology applied in this paper can be summarized into the following steps:(1) Selection of the classes of pressure reduction stations and where to perform the economic investigations;(2) Selection of the energy recovery systems;(3) Sizing of the energy recovery systems and calculation of the produced energy;(4) Calculation of payback period (PBP) and net present value (NPV); and(5) Calculation of the energy recovery efficiency.Each step is described in the following.3.1. Selection of PRS ClassesDetailed monitored data are available for the majority of the PRSs in the national pipeline network,whereas just a little information is available for those installed in the regional pipeline network(i.e., delivering gas to the domestic users). Gas distributors do not monitor the operation of thesestations because of their secondary role in the distribution network. The annual-averaged flow rate ofnatural gas and inlet and outlet pressure data are available for a sample of about 9000 PRSs. Figure 2shows the cumulative percentage distribution of the number of PRSs against (i) the annual-averagedavailable power (Figure 2a) and (ii) the pressure drops (Figure 2b), calculated with Equation (11).Figure 2 shows that about 99% of the PRSs of the sample provides an annual-averaged availablepower between 0 and 500 kW and performs a pressure drop with an expansion ratio between 1 and 20.It is worth noting that almost 75% of PRSs show an available power lower than 10 kW. To simplify thecalculations, 12 PRSs classes were identified, and for each of them a reference station was selectedas representative for the analysis in the following sections. In accordance with the data in Figure 2,the total power range was subdivided in four intervals: (i) 1–10 kW, (ii) 10–50 kW, (iii) 50–200 kW, and(iv) 200–500 kW. A minimum value of 1 kW was set since there was no information about performanceand costs of commercially available systems for these sizes. Similarly, the following three intervals ofEnergies 2020, 13, 4453 5 of 19pressure ratios were chosen: (i) 1–3, (ii) 3–8, and (iii) 8–20. As a result, 12 PRS classes (Figure 3) wereobtained.

Selection of the Energy Recovery Systems Almost the entirety of the works in the literature agree that the production of electricity by expander-generators is the most appropriate way to convert the mechanical energy available from the pressure drops in the PRSs. Despite this, the features of the PRSs that make the use of turboexpanders or volumetric expanders more profitable are often still not clear. It is, therefore, important to analyze the operating characteristics and costs of each kind of expander in relation to those of the PRSs. Moreover, a key point to optimize the design and operation of the energy recovery system as a whole is the proper choice of the thermal source required to avoid an excessive cooling of the gas, which could damage valves and pipelines because of hydrates’ icing. Some promising solutions such as the (1) and (3) ones listed in the Introduction are “location dependent” because they depend on the local features of the thermal sources and/or demands.

All possible combinations (12) among the expansion technologies and natural gas preheating systems considered in the analysis. 3.3. Sizing, Energy Consumption, and Electric Producibility of the Energy Recovery Systems The following subsections describe the methods used to size the energy recovery systems and to predict their annual electric production and energy consumption for gas preheating. 3.3.1. Expanders The size of the expander, identified here by the mass flow rate (𝑚 ) at design point, should be selected for each PRS in accordance with the annual trend of the natural gas mass flow rate, which is strongly affected by the seasonality of consumptions. Figure 5 shows the dimensionless curve of the natural gas mass flow rate derived from measured data of a real PRS installed in Padova (classified in class 2 of Figure 3). To simplify the calculations, this curve was substituted by a five-steps curve, keeping the total area below the curve unchanged, and was then used to reproduce the mass flow rate curves in all PRSs. This was done multiplying, for each PRS, the dimensionless mass flow rate of each step in Figure 5 by the known value of the annual-average mass flow rate through the PRS. Using the same trend for all the PRS classes reduces the accuracy of the calculation but strongly simplifies it. The loss in accuracy obviously depends on the kind of PRS that is considered. Certainly, it will not be high for the main cities in the northern part of Italy, where the trend of natural gas consumption (Figure 5) is similar to that of Padova. In any case, this trend shows a quite high difference between maximum and minimum consumption, which imposes a challenging task for the choice of the expander size. Similar trends are expected also for the mainland areas of Europe. The expected trends at lower latitudes are flatter, making the choice of the expander size easier. Figure 4.

For each of the six possible sizes, the annual producible electricenergy was calculated, using Equation (1), while the design point electric power output was calculatedby using Equation (2).Eel,exp =5∑step=1.mstep·∆his,step·ηis,step·∆tstep·ηel (1)Pel,DP =.mDP·∆his,DP·ηis,DP·ηel (2)where Eel,exp (kWh/y) is the annual electricity producible by the expander,.m (kg/s) is the expandermass flow rate, ∆his (kJ/kg) is the isentropic enthalpy drop, ηis (-) is the isentropic efficiency, and ∆tstepEnergies 2020, 13, 4453 7 of 19[h] is the time interval of each step. The values of the performance parameters at design point were setin accordance with those normally adopted in the design of the considered types of expander (Table 1).For single-stage, radial-turboexpanders, the blade tip speed (U) was limited to a maximum value of400 m/s. This constraint on the blade tip speed was achieved by choosing properly the enthalpy dropthrough the expander (∆his =C202 , where C0 is the isentropic spouting velocity), with the tip-speedratio ( UC0 = 0.7) at design point determined by the search of the optimal fluidynamic behavior [25].Thus, a pressure regulation system (with valves) is generally necessary before the expansion to adjustthe available enthalpy drop to the optimum one chosen for the expander. This adjustment reducesthe pressure drop without extraction of mechanical work because of the isenthalpic process in thevalves. The loss in potential mechanical work is higher with single-stage machines, and can be reduced,increasing the number of stages (the total ∆his was allocated in multiple stages and, therefore, the tipspeed of each stage could satisfy the design point constraints without adjustments of the pressuredrop). Double-stage, radial-turboexpanders were evaluated here (in addition to the single-stage ones)only for PRSs having a too high expansion ratio for a single-stage optimal machine, because theywould entail higher costs without increasing the power production. In these cases, we kept the sameideal enthalpy drop in each stage by fixing the stage exit temperature and, so, evaluating also theintermediate pressure. This criterion established, in turn, the maximum temperature of preheating ineach stage. Figure 7 shows the thermodynamic processes in a dual-stage turbine, expanding naturalgas between 50 and 10 bar. As mentioned above, the ideal enthalpy drop and the outlet temperaturewere set equal for the two stages. An iterative procedure allowed us to calculate the intermediatepressure between the two stages that satisfied the enthalpy drop and outlet temperature constraints.Scroll expanders were considered always as single-stage machines.Energies 2020, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 20   Figure 5. Dimensionless step (linked dots) and original (dashed line) function of the natural gas mass flow rate flowing through a reference PRS. The expander was sized for six different values of design point mass flow rates selected in between the maximum (𝑚 , ) and minimum values (𝑚 , ) by dividing equally the operating field (𝑚 ,  − 𝑚 , ) in Figure 5. For each of the six possible sizes, the annual producible electric energy was calculated, using Equation (1), while the design point electric power output was calculated by using Equation (2).

The values of the performance parameters at design point were set in accordance with those normally adopted in the design of the considered types of expander (Table 1). For single-stage, radial-turboexpanders, the blade tip speed (𝑈) was limited to a maximum value of 400 m/s. This constraint on the blade tip speed was achieved by choosing properly the enthalpy drop through the expander (Δℎ = , where C0 is the isentropic spouting velocity), with the tip-speed ratio ( = 0.7) at design point determined by the search of the optimal fluidynamic behavior [25]. Thus, a pressure regulation system (with valves) is generally necessary before the expansion to adjust the available enthalpy drop to the optimum one chosen for the expander. This adjustment reduces the pressure drop without extraction of mechanical work because of the isenthalpic process in the valves. The loss in potential mechanical work is higher with single-stage machines, and can be reduced, increasing the number of stages (the total Δℎ  was allocated in multiple stages and, therefore, the tip speed of each stage could satisfy the design point constraints without adjustments of the pressure drop).

Annual Available and Recoverable Energy from the PRSs The annual energy made available by the pressure drop in a PRS is calculated using Equation (10): 𝐸 = (𝑚 ∙ Δℎ , − 𝑄 , ) ∙ ∆𝑡    (10) 𝑃 , = . (11) Note that 𝑄 ,  (kW) is the preheating needed when the pressure energy content is dissipated with the standard throttling valves commonly installed in the stations. Accordingly, 𝑄 ,  is often null because the cooling deriving from the isenthalpic process allows satisfying the temperature constraint imposed by the legislation without any preheating. The energy recovery efficiency is calculated using the following equation: 𝜀 = 𝐸 − 𝐸𝐸 , =𝐸 , − (𝐸 , )𝜂 , − 𝐸𝜂𝐸 ,  (12) where 𝐸  (kWh) is the annual primary energy produced by the expander-generator, 𝐸  (kWh) is the annual primary energy consumed for preheating, 𝜂 ,  is the reference efficiency for the electricity production, and 𝜂  is the thermal efficiency of the considered preheating system. Note that in case of heat pumps, 𝐸  must be considered null and 𝐸  is the amount of electricity spent in the heat pump for preheating. Figure 10.

(11)Note that Qth,step (kW) is the preheating needed when the pressure energy content is dissipatedwith the standard throttling valves commonly installed in the stations. Accordingly, Qth,step is often nullbecause the cooling deriving from the isenthalpic process allows satisfying the temperature constraintimposed by the l gislation without ny preheating. The energy recovery efficiency is calculated usingthe following equation:ε =Eexp − EphEav,net=Eel,exp−(Eel,HP)ηel, re f−EphηthEav,net(12)where Eexp (kWh) is the annual primary energy produced by the expander-generator, Eph (kWh) is theannual primary energy consumed for preheating, ηel, re f is the reference efficiency for the electricityproduction, and ηth is the thermal efficiency of the considered preheating system. Note that in case ofheat pumps, Eph must be considered null and Eexp is the amount of electricity spent in the heat pumpfor preheating.3.5. Eco omic EvaluationsThe goal of the economic analysis was to calculate the PBP and NPV of the energy recoverysystems deriving from: the 12 proposed configurations (Figure 4), the six considered sizes (Section 3.3),and the 12 PRS classes (Figure 3). The analysis was performed for one reference station per class havingavailable power and pressure ratio approximately equal to the average between the upper and lowerlimits of its class. This simplification did not involve remarkable variations of the results, consideringthe objective of the current analysis. Taking into account 12 classes, 12 energy recovery systems and sixpossible sizes, 864 cases were evaluated. The PBP and the NPV were calculated as:PBP∑year=1NPV(year) − F0 = F(year)·(1 + k)−year− F0 = 0 (13)Energies 2020, 13, 4453 12 of 19where F(year) is the cash flow in the year being considered, k (=0.015) is the discount rate, and F0 is theinvestment cost. The cash flow takes into account (i) the revenues deriving from selling the electricityto the grid, (ii) the costs of operation, (iii) the cost of maintenance, and (iv) the taxes imposed by theItalian legislation to the electricity generation.3.5.1. Cost of the Investment and MaintenanceThe investment costs of the turboexpander-generators, scroll expander-generators, thermal oilheaters, and water heaters were evaluated using the module costing technique (MCT) proposed byTurton et al. [32]. The MCT evaluates the “bare module equipment cost” (CBM in Equation (14)), whichis the sum of direct and indirect costs of a specific component.CBM = C0P·FBM·Y (14)log10(C0P)= K1 + K2·log10(A) + K3·log210(A) (15)Y =CEPCI2019CEPCI2001=619.2397= 1.56 (16)CP0 is the purchase cost of the equipment at “base conditions” (equipment composed by standardmaterials, working at standard pressure and temperature conditions), which does not include directand indirect costs associated with installation material, piping, insulation, fireproofing, foundations,structural supports, instrumentation, electrical equipment, installation labor, transportations, insurance,salaries, temporary buildings, etc. The “bare module factor” (FBM) in Equation (14) was given as amultiplier to keep into consideration all these additional costs for the considered equipment (Table 3).CP0 is calculated using Equation (15) where A is the size parameter (kW) and the coefficients K1, K2, andK3 are specific for each component (Table 3). The MCT was updated using the Chemical EngineeringPlant Cost Index (CEPCI) of 2019 (multiplying factor Y in Equation (16)).Table 3.

The cost of investment of double-stage radial turboexpanders were evaluated considering eachstage as a single component. The maximum size of scroll expander was 100 kW, in accordance with theEnergies 2020, 13, 4453 13 of 19commercial availability of this kind of machine. Thus, when the size passes that limit, the installation inbatteries of multiple units is considered. Expander sizes that are lower than 10 kW cannot be evaluatedwith the MCT. Therefore, the following cost functions were used when the expanders’ size rangedbetween 1 and 10 kW.Radial turboexpander-generator CRE = 5647.89·P0.673 (17)Scroll expander-generator CSE = 706.0·P0.673 (18)where C (€) is the total investment cost and P (kW) is the power size of the equipment. These equationswere obtained by interpolating data provided by manufacturers. The annual maintenance costs wereset equal to 2% and 1% of the investment cost for the expander-generators and gas-fired heaters,respectively. The MCT does not provide specific cost functions for the CHP-ICE and heat pumps.Therefore, several manufacturers’ data were interpolated to generate the following cost functions:CHP-ICE CICE = 5647.89·Qph0.7074 (19)Maintenance (CHP-ICE) M% = 0.1932·e−0.001·Qph ·100 (20)Geothermal-HP CGHP = −0.2823· ln(Qph)+ 3.618 (21)Air-HP CAHP = −0.1877· ln(Qph)+ 2.253 (22)where M (%) is the annual maintenance cost of ICEs given as percentage of the total investment cost.The annual maintenance cost of the heat pumps was set equal to 1.5% of the total investment cost.The required lifetime of the energy recovery systems was 25 years. The CHP-ICEs can run up to90,000 h, corresponding to about 10 years of continuous operation. As a result, this preheating systemis substituted every 10 years and the corresponding investment costs are to be considered.3.5.2. Cost of Operation, Taxes, and Electricity ValueThe cost of operation is related to the consumption of natural gas in the expander preheatingsystems (it is equal to zero in the case of heat pumps). The natural gas consumption depends onthe performance of the preheating systems, as described in Section 3.3.2. Note that when the energyrecovery system is not sized for the maximum capacity of the station (.mDP <.mstep=1), a fraction of thenatural gas flow rate is expanded and preheated (if required) using the traditional throttling valvesystem coupled to gas-fired heaters. The average cost of natural gas was set to 0.15 €/Stm3. Table 4summarizes the costs associated with the production of electricity imposed by the Italian legislation [33].Note that these costs are valid even if the electricity is totally self-consumed (heat pumps).Table 4.

Selection of the Dominating SolutionsThe solutions provided by the economic analysis are considered feasible only when the PBP islower than the lifetime of the systems (25 years) and when the NPV is a positive value. For each PRSclass, the most convenient solutions were selected using a “dominating” criterion because of the twopossible objectives (maximization of NPV or minimization of PBP).

The ICEs became competitive only at high-power classes havingEnergies 2020, 13, 4453 15 of 19medium-to-high expansion ratios (classes Nos. 8 and 12). Classes Nos. 9, 10, and 11 did not showfeasible solutions due to the high temperature of preheating (i.e., high expansion ratio), which impliedhigh costs that cannot be repaid in a reasonable period because of the low power generated. Class No. 1did not indicate any need of preheating because of the low expansion ratio and the corresponding lowisentropic efficiency of scroll expanders. For a given energy recovery technology, the PBP and NPVincreased with the size of the system (i.e., on.mDP). The ranges of PBP and NPV shown in classes Nos.1, 2, and 3 (corresponding to low expansion ratio and small available power) suggest that maximizingNPV is never worth the related increase of the PBP. Thus, small size heat recovery systems should beconsidered as the most proper solutions for these classes. Conv
