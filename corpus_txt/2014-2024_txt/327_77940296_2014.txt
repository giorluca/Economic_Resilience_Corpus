(2, 5)Sea level rise and other stressors in the mid-Atlantic U.S. are impacting the resilience of coastal communities, and are increasing their overall physical and socio-economic vulnerabilities. The Deal Island Peninsula on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay, MD (Figure 1) is being used as a case study of a coastal heritage community that is experiencing these stressors and is involved in stakeholder-driven resilience and adaptation planning. The “Deal Island Peninsula Marsh & Community Project” is funded by the NERRS Science Collaborative.   Linking Marshes & Communities in the Midst of ChangeA collaborative approach to socio-economic assessment to increase coastal marsh and community resilience on the Chesapeake BayA Q-sort aims to assess diverse viewpoints and values on a topic through quantitative and qualitative techniques.1.  Socio-ecological service statements were derived from stakeholder inputs from the first project workshop• Services fell under three of following categories: consumptive use, non-consumptive use, and non-use (Figure 6)2.  A Q-sort activity was conducted at a public workshop (Figure 3)• 26 stakeholders sorted 19 cards in a pre-determined distribution (Figure 4) from more to less important (1, 3, 4, 6)• Each card had a typed statement of a socio-ecological service (Figure 5)• Stakeholders were asked to group services based on which they felt were more or less important to sustain in good condition for the long term• Stakeholders identified the most important services to sustain on the Deal Island Peninsula as 1) marsh system vitality, 2) marshes reducing storm and erosion impacts, and 3) habitat for juvenile fish, crabs, and oysters (Figure 7)1) Better understand stakeholder relationships with marsh ecosystems and services they provide.2) Bring stakeholder perceptions and values of socio-ecological services into a coastal decision-making framework.3) Bridge the gap between science and decision-making through improved communication and collaboration. • Semi-structured stakeholder interviews• Cultural models • Collection of marsh ecological data• Geospatial analyses • Adult experiential learning activities• K-12 education and outreach • Public stakeholder workshops• Science communication & translation• Stakeholder engagement in applied science investigations• Marsh restorationOngoing Work (project-wide)Collaborative Learning Apply ing  Soc ia l  Sc ience  & Anthropology  Too lsCultural Analysis Institutional AnalysisScan this barcode with your smart phone and dive into our project website!I would like to thank the NERRS Science Collaborative for funding and supporting my graduate education and this project, my adviser Dr. Mimi L.

University of New Hampshire2. University of Maryland3. Chesapeake Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve in Marylandwww.DealIslandMarshandCommunityProject.orgThe goals of this project are to: 1. Enhance stakeholder collaboration and elicit local knowledge2. Develop and test a broadly transferable process based on the Collaborative Learning approach that elicits stakeholder-driven coastal decision-making3. Examine coastal decision-making and socio-ecological service values using integrated ecological, economic, and anthropological applied science methods. AcknowledgementsbacFigure 1.

The focus of this poster is to describe the collaborative approach taken towards a socio-economic assessment of the Deal Island Peninsula.• Stakeholders are thinking about long-term impacts rather than only short-term needs (Figure 8)• The consistent focus across stakeholders on system-wide services should promote collaborative adaptation and problem-solving
