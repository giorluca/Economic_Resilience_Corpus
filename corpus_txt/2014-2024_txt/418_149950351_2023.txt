The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been felt by the Indonesian people since the implementation of the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) on March 15, 2020. Community activities are forced to be carried out through digital transformation in services, transactions and work, for example DKI Jakarta Provincial Government.  The Character Of Social Media Of The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to Help Inclusive… Sukarni Novita Sari, dkk 126 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023   The digitalization of media through the wide internet gateway is open to all people. Most of the world's population is connected to the internet. Digital media provides changes and even revolutions in the relationship between institutions and society. During this time, communication tends to be dominated by one-way and broadcast type, but now it has become interactivity. Institutions and audiences are entities (in internet language referred to as nodes) that are comparable, are in the same network, and can influence. For example, digital media constructs trust and sentiment through trending topics, viral, as well as issues discussed and stored (databases and archives) that can be accessed. (Nasrullah, 2021). The social media research trend is on the rise and is popular nowadays. This is evidenced by many researchers conducting research and publications in international journals discussing social media. Like (Jernigan, 2020), (Isaac Kofi Nti; Adebayo Felix Adekoya; Michael Opoku; Peter Nimbe,2020), (Enilda Romero-Hall; Erika Petersen; Renata Sindicic; Linlin Li, 2020), (Stephan Längle,2019), (Martins, 2022), (Kenneth Nwanua Ohei, 2019), (Ryanto Budiana et al., 2016), (Akbar et al., 2021), (Fajriyah et al., 2020), (Wilantika & Wibisono, 2021), (Sajane & Gaikwad, 2022) ,(Sajane & Gaikwad, 2022), (Uitz, 2012), (Charalambous, 2019), (Salafia & Diplacido, 2022), (Vaterlaus et al., 2022) dan (Squires, 2022)  Discussing Social Media helps in health, teaching and learning activities, leadership business, feminism, pop culture the role of Social Media The Regional Government helps provide information and handle the Covid-19 Pandemic And Evaluation of Local Government Performance through social media are happening around the world today.Based on the formulation of the problem above, the purpose of this study is to find out How is the Social Media Character of the  DKI Jakarta Provincial Government in helping inclusive and sustainable economic recovery in Jakarta.  METHOD This study uses the method of Phenomenology of Edmund Husserl. Husserl asserted that not only research but philosophy of theory or philosophy of science. The method used to find out from his experience actually becomes the truth he experiences.Method is to be understood here not as a technique of research, but in the etymological sense of a means of access to a field of research, which is to say that those considerations belong to the theory or philosophy of science. According to Husserl, the method of achieving eidetic knowledge is knowledge of reality. So, intentionality or directness to objective knowledge is a formal goal.Intentionally, denoting the presentational and objectivating function of consciousness, more precisely, the fact that the same object appears in a variety of manners of presentation, is entirely due to apperceptive characters. Practicing the phenomenological method, the non-essential elements are reduced through epoche. By placing non-essential elements to consciousness to capture the meaning and understanding of reality. (Poespowardojo, T. S., & Seran, 2015)  The character of social media in digital communication is as follows. First Network (network) between users. The word network (network) can be understood in terms of technology fields such as computer science which means infrastructure that connects computers and other hardware. This connection is necessary because communication can occur if computers are connected, including data transfer (Castells, 2002; Gane & Beer, 2008. Social media has the character of a social network. Of course, social media is built from social structures formed in networks or the internet. , as emphasized by Castells (2002), that the structure or social organization formed on the internet is based on an information network that basically operates based on information technology in micro-electronics.The network formed between users is a network that is technologically mediated by technological devices such as computers, mobile phones, to tablets. Although social networks on social media are formed through technological devices, such as the internet, it is not just a tool (tools). The internet also contributes to the emergence of social The Character Of Social Media Of The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to Help Inclusive… Sukarni Novita Sari, dkk 127 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023   bonds on the internet, values in virtual society, to the social structure on line. It's no surprise then. Manuel Castelles (2002: xxxi) says that "The network is the message, and the Internet is the messenger". Second Information (information) as a character in social media can be seen from two aspects. First, social media is a medium that works based on information. From the institutional side, social media is built based on information that is encoded (encoding) which is then distributed through various devices until it is accessed by users (decoding). From the user side, information becomes the basis for users to interact with each other and form a network community on the internet. Second, information becomes a commodity on social media. Every person who wants to log in to social media, then he must include his personal information regardless of the data is real or fabricated in order to have an account and access. This uploaded data becomes a commodity that can be traded from a business perspective. This data is also a representation of the identity of the user himself. Especially for users who have never met physically and met offline, the formation of a network on social media is certainly one of the reasons for the similarities such as regional origin, hobbies, to the status uploaded by other users. Information here becomes a commodity that is consumed between users. Third archives become a character that explains that information has been stored and can be accessed at any time and through any device. Any information that is uploaded on Facebook, for example, then the information does not just disappear when the turn of the day, month to year. The information will continue to be stored and can even be easily accessed (Nasrullah, 2015a). There are two changes to archives with the advent of communication technology, namely the ability of internet users to access archives and make changes to them; and secondly, the archive itself is becoming more developed due to what Appadurai calls "the nature and distributions of its users". Because archives in this case are not only seen as only certain official documents that are stored, but the internet itself with networks, information distribution, and mediation between humans and machines becomes a kind of data repository (see Appadurai, 2003:17).(Rulli Nasrullah, 2021) The objects used as informants in this research are Ms. Angelika Rosma, S.S., M.Sc. a Digital Media Practitioner who lives at Jalan Pulo Asem Utara 11 Number 41 East Jakarta and Mr. Heru Sudinta, SE., MM, 40 years old Media Practitioner Producer of Main News Television Station TVOne who lives in Bekasi City.The total number of informants are two people. This informant is seen to represent what he wants to study and is selected based on the context that the researcher wants to discuss in this study. The results of the study were formulated in two main terms, namely the quality of the research instrument, and the quality of data collection. The quality of the research instrument is in accordance with the validity and reliability of the instrument and the quality of data collection is in accordance with the methods used to collect data.Data collection is done naturally (natural setting), in the laboratory with experimental methods, at home, seminar meetings, discussions, and others. The technique of collecting is done by questionnaire (questionnaire), observation (observation), interview (interview), and collaboration. (Sugiyono, 2021) Data analysis in qualitative research is carried out during data collection. Researchers conduct interviews, if the answers interviewed after being analyzed feel unsatisfactory, the researcher will continue the question until the stage of obtaining data that is considered credible. Miles & Huberman (1992) suggested that activities in qualitative data analysis were carried out interactively. Activities in data analysis are data reduction, data display, and data verification.Conclusions in qualitative research answer the problem formulation, maybe not. The conclusions of qualitative research are expected to get new findings that have never existed or complement existing findings. The findings are in the form of a description or description of the object of research.  (Ronda, 2018).   The Character Of Social Media Of The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to Help Inclusive… Sukarni Novita Sari, dkk 128 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023   RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Researchers conducted interviews with key informant Ms. Angelika Rosma, S.S., M.Sc., a 45 year old Digital Media Practitioner who lives at Jalan Pulo Asem Utara 11 Number 41 East Jakarta. The character of social media in digital communication is as follows. First Network (network) between users. The word network (network) can be understood in terms of technology fields such as computer science which means infrastructure that connects computers and other hardware (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). The social media of DKI Jakarta Provincial Government from a network and qualitative perspective has shown good quality because the information is quite referential. Mrs. Angelika said that “... I looked for the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's social media. I observed on Instagram that from a network perspective, the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government and Jakarta residents. From a qualitative point of view, the quality is good because the information is quite referential. This means that from various sides the policies of the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta were conveyed. Not only emphasizing the health sector but also for example matters related to the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's own agenda to go abroad or related to economic recovery. Related matters are usually the Jakarta Smart Card (KJP). So I see from a networking point of view that the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta has built good quality for its citizens from a comprehensive reporting perspective. Then the second is also in terms of speed, meaning that we still have a look at the City Government's social media, for example, say City X is like that. In terms of speed, it is slow, which means that later it is considered not enough updates and also issues related to the City are also not answered. Meanwhile, for Instagram, the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is quite an answer. Then in terms of followers it is also quite booming even though it hasn't reached 1 million but it is good enough and this also shows the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta in managing social media. If you say it's optimal, I'd say not because the interaction from Jakarta residents from the chat column side is still not too high. However, in terms of reception and live, it is quite high. I see a lack of chit chat because the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta has no problem in this matter and the posts raised are also in clear areas. So we can see that the interaction isn't booming compared to the likes. It can get up to 5,000 likes, only about 30 comments. But anyway, it shows positive interactions from the Social Media of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government with Jakarta residents with its inclusive side I think is sustainable because the updates are always quite fast. We also see that the events organized by the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta relating to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in DKI Jakarta are also quite massive …” Second Information (information) as a character in social media can be seen from two aspects. First, social media is a medium that works based on information. From the institutional side, social media is built based on information that is encoded (encoding) which is then distributed through various devices until it is accessed by users (decoding). (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). The information submitted by DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's Social Media has been well and optimally represented. Mrs. Angelika said that "... The information conveyed by DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's Social Media has been represented well and optimally. I think this is indeed a function that is very closely related to social media. This is also related to DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's Cyber Public Relations to Jakarta residents. Second, because DKI Jakarta Province itself is the central capital in Indonesia. Information needs must be managed properly. Moreover, we are a very dense province. 12 million people during the day. 7 million people at night. Where 12 million people come from cities supporting cities for DKI Jakarta such as Bogor, Tangerang, Depok and Bekasi The Character Of Social Media Of The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to Help Inclusive… Sukarni Novita Sari, dkk 129 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023   to work in Jakarta. So of course very important information is needed by DKI Jakarta residents. The information side is then also to minimize areas of ignorance then areas where there is contact - real contact can be overcome by managing social media good luck. Cutting costs that were before the social media era was considerable. However, because now is the era of social media such as Instagram itself, it is still in the second highest ranking in Indonesia. Only the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is very well managed. So because the speed of the news is also quite fast from various sides, it is not only monotn from the news from one side but also shows the activeness of Social Media of the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta with the mandates that are charged…” Third archives become a character that explains that information has been stored and can be accessed at any time and through any device. Any information that is uploaded on Facebook, for example, then the information does not just disappear when the turn of the day, month to year. The information will continue to be stored and can even be easily accessed (Nasrullah, 2015a). (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). The Instagram Social Media Archive of the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is already good with a score of 8 out of 10. It can be improved and improved in the future. Mrs. Angelika said that “…There are the latest features in the characteristics of social media that the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is following. Like on Instagram right now there is a team. Just like on Tik Tok too. As from the hundreds of posts that have been submitted via Instagram DKI Jakarta Provincial Government. You can choose the top 3 posts, you can choose, for example, from those with the most likes, the most chit chat or controversial issues, issues that are still floating. I see that the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta has not done this from an archiving perspective. Archiving, which in the current context follows along and in tune with what the social media updates reveal. I think it's good enough and quite optimal, but it can be improved further. The improvement is of course if the maintenance of social media can be managed professionally. I think it's just a matter of fixing it and adding more because now Instagram is getting more advanced. Instagram has highlights that categories like that can be done by Instagram so that it makes its users even more friendly. Easier to find the information we want. On Youtube, we know that YouTube has channel categorization. If the videos are the same but if the channel categorization we can open the channels. We can adjust the channels according to the topic and theme. The Instagram Social Media Archive of the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is already good with a score of 8 out of 10. It can be improved and improved further in the future…” The researcher also conducted interviews with the informant Mr. Heru Sudinta, SE., MM is 40 years old. He is a Media Practitioner, Main News Producer for TVOne Television Station, who lives in Bekasi City. The character of social media in digital communication is as follows. First Network (network) between users. The word network (network) can be understood in terms of technology fields such as computer science which means infrastructure that connects computers and other hardware. (Rulli Nasrallah, 2021). The Social Media Character of DKI Provincial Government is able to provide a stimulus in recovering the economy in Jakarta. Mr. Heru said that “... Building a social media network is indeed capable of being a companion to the mass media in sharing information and knowledge. Individuals or groups can certainly become part of social media users, especially now that the internet network has bridged individuals and organizations to participate as users of social media networks. It says "free", technically of course. Because users must have an operator network to be able to actively surf social media. With regard to organizations as social media users with specific goals, the organization must determine the segmentation of who will receive or interact with the organization. If it is not right on target, then all social media publications will be biased. Before assessing the character of social media publications, the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is able or not to help economic recovery. So we have to investigate first, whether other social media users interact with the The Character Of Social Media Of The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to Help Inclusive… Sukarni Novita Sari, dkk 130 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023   Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta or not. Why? Because if it turns out that those who interact with the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's social media live in Papua, Kalimantan, Sumatra or Bali, that means they are not on target. However, personally as a resident of DKI Jakarta or in direct contact with the Capital City, I think the Social Media Character of the Provincial Government of DKI is able to provide a stimulus in recovering the economy in Jakarta. The reason is that the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta also cooperates with the mass media in social media publications as an image booster. News from the mass media is often re-uploaded to social media, so the role of social media for the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta is included in the category that contains regulative, informative, inspirational content for the universe of social media users…” Second Information as a character in social media can be seen from two aspects. First, social media is a medium that works based on information. From the institutional side, social media is built based on information that is encoded (encoding) which is then distributed through various devices until it is accessed by users (decoding) (Rulli Nasrullah, 2021). The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government is very selective about all its uploads on social media. Mr. Heru said that “…Regarding the informative nature of social media, I have to relate it to opinions. This information can be in the form of personal opinion and can be in the form of individual opinion. Personal Opinion means that any information uploaded to social media is personal responsibility (if an individual) or corporate responsibility (if an organization). so if there is a mistake or oversight or objection or claim, the legal basis that can be linked and used is the ITE Law. It's different with Individual Opinions, everything that is uploaded can be information from other people or other organizations. Like publishing news from the mass media, if there is an error or mistake or an objection or a claim, the legal basis that can be linked and used is in the form of the Press Law. In my opinion, the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government is very selective about all its uploads on social media. Apart from considering the informative side, there is a humanist burden (needs of many people) and of course inspirational in order to be able to attract the mass media…” The three archives become a character that explains that information has been stored and can be accessed at any time and through any device. Any information that is uploaded on Facebook, for example, then the information does not just disappear when the turn of the day, month to year. The information will continue to be stored and can even be easily accessed (Nasrullah, 2015a). (Rulli Nasrallah, 2021). Archives that are generally uploaded are in the form of public service advertisements, regional regulations, counseling, creative ideas, inspirational and informative stories in the form of good opportunities for residents. Mr. Heru said that “…Speaking of archives, we must first translate what archives mean, whether they are just audio, visual, audio-visual or virtual archives. Not all categories of archives are related to the public interest, but there are also archives in the form of confidential documents which are definitely not appropriate for uploading to social media. If what I understand are audio archives, visual archives, audio visual archives and virtual archives, then I think that through social media the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta has been able to help economic recovery. Archives that are generally uploaded are in the form of public service advertisements, regional regulations, counseling, creative ideas, inspirational and informative stories in the form of good opportunities for residents. The Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta, especially during the leadership of Governor Anies Baswedan, was able to collaborate on social media and mass media, so as to ensure the flow of valid information…”       The Character Of Social Media Of The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to Help Inclusive… Sukarni Novita Sari, dkk 131 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023   CONCLUSION Based on the Data Findings, Data Results and Discussions that the researchers have conveyed, it can be concluded that Pemerintah Provinsi DKI Jakarta has used Social Media Characters to assist an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery in Indonesia. The first character is from a network perspective between the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government and Jakarta residents. From a qualitative point of view, the quality is good because the information is quite referential. This means that from various sides the policies of the Provincial Government of DKI Jakarta were conveyed. Not only emphasizing the health sector but also for example matters related to the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's own agenda to go abroad or related to economic recovery. Second, using Social Media Characters. Second, Information such as the Social Media Information conveyed by the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's Social Media has been properly and optimally represented. The information side is then also to minimize areas of ignorance then areas where there are intersections that actually can be overcome with good social media management. Cutting costs that were before the social media era was considerable. Third, using the Third Social Media Character, the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's social media has been able to help economic recovery. Archives that are generally uploaded are in the form of public service advertisements, regional regulations, counseling, creative ideas, inspirational and informative stories in the form of good opportunities for residents. Researchers recommend several things. First, increasing social media interaction from Jakarta residents from the side of the chat column is still not too high. Second, improving social media skills is of course if the maintenance of social media can be managed professionally. Third, Big Data owned by the Social Media accounts of DKI Jakarta Provincial Government can be used for research, studies to plan and carry out various activities, including activities towards inclusive and sustainable economic recovery in Indonesia.
