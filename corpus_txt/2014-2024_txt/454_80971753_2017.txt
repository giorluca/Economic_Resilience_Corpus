These devastating impacts on the livelihoods of subsistence farmers persist in part due to the continuous reliance on indigenous climate information and cultivation of indigenous seed with a share of land of about 81%.   Garu-Tempane is located within the savannah sahel vegetation zone ― a region very vulnerable to climate variability and changes. With about 70% of the district’s population engaged actively in crop farming, changes in climatic conditions has been an undesirable phenomenon to deal with among farmers.  Climate-smart seed and scientific climate information has the potential to reduce the impacts of climate change. However, adoption rates in the district are low ― about 19% farm land coverage. It is thus exigent to investigate the reasons for the low adoption rate. Even though much is reported in literature on the low adoption rate of climate information and climate-smart seed among farmers, little is known about the hindrances to adoption.  With a system dynamics simulation model, this research explains the reference behaviour and identifies policy options for effective adaptation to climate change by subsistence farmers in the district. Anchored on adoption and diffusion of agriculture technology modelling, the research brings to light, the impact of climate information on crop yield and incomes of subsistence farmers in the district, the factors that affect adoption and how these can be addressed to enable farmers to turn the challenges of climate change into opportunities.   A rigorous approach of data collection and triangulation from participatory learning with communities, focus groups, interviews with climate information service providers and secondary data are the basis upon which conclusions are drawn. Identified in this study, main factors that affect the adoption of both climate information and climate smart-seed include: trust in climate-smart seed and scientific climate information, knowledge in the cultivation of climate-smart seed and input cost.  Trust in the climate-smart seed is necessary to speed up further adoption towards the transition from the indigenous seed trajectory to climate-smart seed.  Equally important is knowledge, comprising most importantly climate information (onset and cessation of rainfall and extreme weather events) and existing farm management practise as well as learning from extension services to meet the variability and changes in climatic conditions. According to the study, what farmers need is reliable farmer specific weather/climate forecast. It is indispensable in the knowledge upgrading process to make available climate information/seasonal forecast with in-season updates and climate resilient seed to enable farmers to make informed decisions to increase harvest.  Most important is the affordability of input costs especially of fertilizer cost because maize does well when fertilizer is applied to it. Farmer household income levels determines the affordability of climate information and seed. And adoption of scientific climate information iv  and appropriate advisories (climate-smart seed) is a necessary condition for a transition from subsistence agriculture to commercial farming and to make these affordable.  Proposed policy options from the simulation model include subsidising fertilizer prices further for example by 50% to increase adoption of climate-smart seed and information in the short run. This will help increase and stabilise incomes to enable farmers to pay the actual cost of fertilizer. Constructing climate information centres (designed with loud speakers) will help disseminate climate information/seasonal forecast to a number of communities at a time to reduce cost of individual subscription to climate information service providers. These centres could also serve as platforms for marketing farm produce. Instituting radio programmes would create a platform for farmers to share best practises to increase knowledge of other farmers as well as farmer field schools and demonstration farms. These would shorten trust adjustment in climate-smart seed and information and increase knowledge significantly within a short period of time for increased adoption.

uncertainty about the future. The impacts of climate change on agriculture, which include crop failure, translated to hunger and loss of incomes, are already being felt, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Such impacts add another layer of difficulty in achieving productive and secure livelihoods among the most vulnerable people on the continent. Climate change is better expressed one of the main challenges to development in general (Ambani and Percy 2014) and livelihoods and food security in the Sub-Saharan African region in particular, given that about 70% of the population is engaged in small-scale rainfed agriculture (Alemaw and Simalenga, 2015).    Rain-fed agriculture is severely exposed to the vagaries of climate change (Alemaw and Simalenga, 2015) in this region. Widespread hunger and rural poverty confirm the severity of climate change in Sub Saharan Africa. This is an indication of the urgent need to increase food production and poverty alleviation efforts. The combined effects of extreme weather events including droughts and floods presented by climate change continue to reduce crop yield thus affecting the resilience of rain-fed agriculture (ibid). The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, 2014) reports that, an estimated 223 million people currently in this part of the world are undernourished and it is envisaged that climate change could worsen this, increasing this figure by an additional 132 million by 2050.   In Ghana, the situation is no different. It can be described as worse in the savannah sahel vegetation zone where the study district-Garu-Tempane is located. This region experiences a single continually shorten rainfall season. Changing climate ― late start of the rains, reduced amount and erratic distribution of rainfall and temperature extremes has resulted in continuous shift in the crop planting period from early April in the 1960s to late April or early May in recent years (Tonah, 1993: Mensah-Bonsu, 2003). With about 70% of the district’s population engaged actively in crop farming, changes in climatic conditions has been an undesirable phenomenon to most especially to these farmers. Observations over decades in this part of the country indicate that such a change and variability in the climate has brought about unpredictable floods or dry spells induced by excessive rains and/or long periods of droughts.  2  It is thus glaring how agriculture production systems largely dependent on rain fall in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the study district is vulnerable to changes in climatic conditions bringing devastating impacts on household livelihoods. To minimise the devastating impacts of climate change, forecast that predict the weather to enhance understanding well ahead of the season is very beneficial to those involved in agricultural production if communicated in user specific and relevant format (Coe and Stern, 2011). Well documented evaluations of the resulting benefits from the applications of forecast affirm a potential to improve rural livelihood and agriculture production with such forecast. However, constraint of access and understanding the information available has been a hindrance to adoption of climate information especially among small holder farmers (Hansen et al. (2011). Reporting on a study on Zimbabwean farmers, Hansen et al. (2011) discovered that they achieved a 19% yield benefit in 2003/04 unlike their colleagues who did not apply the forecast to their decisions. Ambami and Percy (2014) allude to this fact adding that climate information plays a major role in understanding climate as a major influence on livelihoods, resources and development efforts.  The Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, (2014) discusses further these opportunities including adoption of ‘climate-smart’ agricultural technologies to build resilience to these changes. On the state of food and agriculture in the midst of climate change, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (2016) also emphasises the urgent need to support small holder famers and all whose livelihoods are intimately and inextricably linked to the climate with greater access to technologies and information to enable them to adjust their production systems and practices accordingly. This is necessary because continuous reliance on indigenous knowledge of predicting climatic conditions is no longer adequate. It can then be deduced that skilfully communicating seasonal forecasts tailored to the needs of the farmer helps to better understand the planting season and to make informed decisions to reduce their vulnerability.   However, it is the case in Africa and Ghana is no exception that there exists a considerable evidence of a gap between existing seasonal forecast and the information needed to support the decision- making processes of famers. It is often difficult for farmers to understand the current hard core scientific language and format in which such relevant forecast is communicated (Hansen et al. (2011). Farmers are not in need of general forecast but downscaled and locally interpreted information about the growing season beyond seasonal averages, transparently accurate in probabilistic terms and most importantly interpreted in a form that brings out clearly the implications of such forecast to agriculture (ibid). It is not enough to generate climate information because scientific understanding is only the beginning of the process of developing socio-economic benefits from satellite data. Such data must be turned into information to be disseminated at the right time in useable forms to individuals and organisations that put the information to practical use (Williamson et al, 2002). In view of this, the Community Based Adaptation 9 Conference highlights: “Communicating climate information to local communities needs to be revisited to ensure that available climate information is effectively adopted for decision making towards resilient livelihood (Nyasimi & Mungai, 2015). It has also been observed that where such farmer specific and detail information exists, it is usually 3  provided by private climate information services requiring that farmers bare the subscription cost, one major hindrance to adoption of such invaluable resource.  It is thus imperative that Agricultural Units and Agricultural Extension Personal collaborate with climate information service providers to provide user specific climate information (Coe and Stern, 2011). This collaboration would help to augment existing indigenous information and knowledge since indigenous climate information and knowledge is no longer adequate to support decision-making. Scientifically generated climate information is detailed enough to provide the amount, distribution, onset and cessation dates of rainfall and other relevant climatic factors, capable of enabling vulnerable groups to effectively adapt to irregular and inadequate rainfall distribution patterns.   Regardless of the existing literature that emphasises the relevant role climate information plays in effective climate change adaptation and especially safe-guarding livelihood, none gives an integrated, process-oriented policy perspective that helps study the dynamics of adoption of climate information. Specifically, the relationship between these factors that hinder or facilitate the adoption of climate information by farmers and how these can be addressed. In most cases where these factors are presented, an integrated policy leverage is absent.   This study focuses on adoption and diffusion of available scientific climate information and services/advisories, identifying the endogenously generated hindrance to adoption of agriculture technology and leverage points to facilitate the adoption process. The research emphasises how the causal-effect relationship among adoption of climate information and services, agriculture production and livelihoods could be well managed with sustainable policy options through the community-based system dynamics modelling approach. The system dynamics model developed, provides a concrete framework for the researcher to study the dynamics of adoption of climate information and climate- smart seed among rural subsistence farmers over time. The scenarios generated from the model then forms the basis for informed policies options presented in this research for alleviating and improving food security and incomes of the population under study.  1.2 REFERENCE MODE  Literature reviewed and data from the field revealed that there is a wide gap between the generation of climate information and the adoption of such information by the target end-users.  For instance, Patt & Gwata (2002) report limited utilisation of climate information among Zimbabwean farmers.  In Ghana, a study in Akasti (in the Volta region) in 2006 observed a similar situation. Of 26 farmers who were provided with weather forecast and information on the onset of the planting season and rainfall pattern, 9 farmers of the sample, that is 34.6% of the farmers agreed to heed the forecast and the advisory. The rest chose to follow their 4  indigenous knowledge. Of the 34.6% who agreed to plant early based on the climate information relayed to them, only 15% actually did (Adiku, 2012). Everyone else planted based on indigenous knowledge. A common finding in the above is that though scientifically generated climate information may be available there is still a gap between the generation and the actual adoption of this information in farmer decision-making. This gives rise to the need to study the dynamics of diffusion and adoption of the information and climate-smart seeds for effective adaptation to climate change.   Historical data on the adoption and coverage of climate information in the Garu-Tempane district is not available. As such, since the use of climate-smart seeds by farmers is accompanied by the dissemination of scientific climate information, coverage of the use of climate-smart maize seeds by farmers is used to as a proxy to determine the adoption of climate information in the study district. Available data suggests that improved seeds in general were introduced in the district in the 1990s (Ibrahim, Personal Communication). However, judging from the aforementioned cases on the usage of scientific climate information, it is not surprising to observe that as at 2010, only about 19% of cultivated land was with improved maize seed. It is thus the proxy for the estimated coverage of land under scientific climate information in this study. Deductively, about 81% of maize cultivated area is under indigenous seed. Farmers continue to rely on indigenous seed and ways of forecast. Indigenous forecast is however no longer adequate to predict changes and variability in climate. The indigenous seed is also less resilient to these changes that occur. The resultant low yields per farm is attributable to the effect of the low coverage of climate-smart seed with relatively higher yield potential, accompanied by scientifically generated climate information. To cope with the decreasing yield per unit of land, farmers who have the capacity are shifting to cultivating more land in order to meet their domestic food needs as well as for sale. However, with population growth, this is not a sustainable approach. Table 1.1 depicts the reference mode of behaviour motivating this study. Figure 1.1: Reference Mode of System Behaviour  Source: Garu-Tempane District Crop Unit, 2016 5  1.3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY The system dynamic approach to problem identification and problem solving is the main approach applied in this study. The approach is used because it allows the development of a framework that integrates the many factors presented in different studies thus laying the foundation for integrated feasible policy options to the problem identified. With a simulation model, it is possible to understand the dynamic implications of processes of accumulation in trust and knowledge building process which is necessary in the adoption of technology (Kopainsky et al 2012). Such a framework enables an in-depth analysis of the adoption of climate information and its impact on agricultural production, livelihood sustenance and effective adaptation to climate change given its emphasis on cause-effect relationship and accumulation characteristics. The approach helps to develop sustainable solutions guided by the feedback perspective of system dynamics given that the structure dictates the behaviour (Hovmand, 2014). It provides a scientific basis for investing in climate information illustrated through scenarios generated with the simulation model. In this study, it was essential to involve communities in this approach particularly because it facilitates learning among participants about the system, creates an opportunity for social learning among stakeholders whilst building social capital to support implementation of policies (Stave, 2010).   1.3.1 Research Objectives ● To develop a concrete simulation model that explains the reference behaviour and feasible policy options for effective adaption to climate change among subsistence farmers in the Garu -Tempane District. ● To determine the impact of the adoption of climate information and climate-smart seed on crop yield and incomes of subsistence farmer in Garu-Tempane, Ghana ● To examine the factors that influence farmers’ adoption of climate information and climate-smart seed.   1.3.2 Research Questions ● What is the impact of the adoption of climate information and climate-smart seed on crop yield and farmers income? ● What factors determine adoption of climate information among subsistence farmers in Garu-Tempane District?  ● What challenges and opportunities could hinder or support effective adoption of weather and climate information and services in the study district? 6   1.3.3 Techniques and Tools for Data Collection and Analysis Given the qualitative and quantitative nature of the research questions and the sample size of the study, the research strategy follows a mixed approach and is carried out as a mixed-method case study. Specifically, the following techniques were used: ● Secondary data collection/reviews  ● Semi-structured interviews ● Focused group discussions ● Community-based system dynamics modelling ● Pair-wise ranking Literature reviews complemented with expert interviews with purposively sampled stakeholders (subsistence farmers, agricultural units and climate information services providers) were conducted to seek expert views and to confirm the researcher’s observation of the actual system represented in this study. These expert interviews provided information relevant to identifying variables in the adoption of climate information.  Focus group discussion were conducted with communities to develop the causal structure, generating the problem under study. This formed the basis for the simulation model. After this extensive multi-method data collection; model building, testing, validation and analyses that studied the leverage points influencing adoption was then done. Results of these analysis from the model are the basis for the conclusions on how adoption can be strengthened, that is, which factors need to be focused on, in terms of policies to support the effective adoption of climate information and advisories.  1.3.4 Data Analysis Validation was conducted subjecting the model to various test to determine its robustness and usefulness in for its purpose. Focus was primarily on the interaction between crucial elements of climate information and seed adoption processes. Of much interest is the behavioural outcomes of the feedback mechanisms and causal relationships and not necessarily the exact numerical outputs. With a valid model. Scenario runs were generated from the simulation model based on which behaviour analysis was done. Such structural- behaviour oriented analysis informed the conclusions on the feasible policy options suggested thereof.    7  1.4 ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY This study is organised into six chapters. Chapter one is an introduction to the study. It encapsulates the background, problem statement; research questions, scope of study and research methodology. Chapter two covers literature reviewed on climate change and agriculture production, climate-smart seed variety adoption, climate information and service adoption, indigenous seed variety, indigenous climate information and adoption and household incomes. In chapter three, a description/documentation of the model is presented. Chapter four discusses the model validity and confidence in its usefulness. With a valid model structure in chapter four, model behaviour analysis and policies developed as leverage points to attain desired system behaviour is presented in chapter five. Chapter six discusses the researcher’s conclusion and recommendations for further studies.                         8   CHAPTER TWO  LITERATURE REVIEW   2.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter covers a review of relevant literature that specifies the boundaries for the study. It sets out the basis for assumptions regarding the model developed to represent the real system. Literature was reviewed on the adoption of climate information and its relevance in this context, the adoption of climate-smart seed, indigenous seed variety, and the characteristics of these seed varieties and how well these have been performing amidst changing climatic conditions.  2.2 CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations defines Climate-Smart-Agriculture as “agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience (adaptation), reduces/removes Green House Gases (mitigation) where possible, and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals”. In this definition, the principal goal and basic concept of Climate-Smart Agriculture is seen as food security and development (Food and Agriculture Organisation 2013a; Lipper et al. 2014). This suggests that for a practice or input to be classified climate-smart, it should exhibit the above qualities. These tenets of climate-smart agriculture are illustrated in the figure below, the guiding principle for the definition of climate-smart seed in this study:           9  Figure 2: Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA)   Source: Papuso, and Faraby, (2013) Climate Smart Agriculture. Seminar on Climate Change and Risk Management. 2.3 DETERMINANTS OF ADOPTION AND DIFFUSION OF AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY Adoption is defined differently by many authors. A common yet significant theme in the definitions is becoming knowledgeable of a technology, making the decision to attempt using it for the first time and continuous use over time. Loevinsohn et al., (2013) defines it as the process of integrating a new technology into existing practice which is often preceded by a period of experimenting and some degree of adaptation. For Bonabana-Wabbi, (2002) it is a mental process that an individual goes through from first hearing about an innovation to finally utilising it. Mwangi and Kariuki, (2015) agree with the other mentioned authors and goes further to make mention of a distinction of relative speed with which farmers make use of an innovation as the rate of adoption which encompasses the element of time and the level of use of that technology which also gives an idea of the intensity of the use of it within a given period of time.  Literature on the determinants of adoption of technology clearly show that many authors come out with categorisations of the determinants of technology adoption that fits best the context of their study. Relevant to this study is the categorisation by Loevinsohn et al. (2013). Farmers’ decision to adopt new technology is determined by the dynamic interaction between characteristics of the technology itself and their conditions and circumstances (ibid). Implementing the adoption decision is as a result of a series of individual decisions and these decisions are usually the result of making a comparison between the uncertain benefits of the new technology with the uncertain costs to be incurred (Hall and Khan, 2002). 10  Traditionally, economic analysis explains the adoption dynamics relative to personal characteristics and resources, imperfect information, risk, uncertainty, institutional constraints, infrastructure and availability of inputs (Uaiene, 2009). Recent literature on adoption includes social networks and learning as determinants of technology (ibid). Some others group these factors into different categories including those of Akudugu et al. (2012)’s grouping of the determinants of agricultural technology adoption into three categories namely; economic, social and institutional factors. McNamara et al, (1991) classify them into, farmer characteristics, the structure of the farm, institutional characteristics and managerial structure, while Wu and Babcock (1998)’s categorisation is into human capital, production, policy and natural resource characteristics.  The determinants of adoption and diffusion of new technology can be largely grouped into four main categories including varietal characteristics, farm-level characteristics, farmer characteristics and institutional characteristics as presented in the table 0.1.  Table 0:1Determinants of Adoption and Diffusion of New Agricultural Technologies Category Determinant Varietal Characteristics yield (expected gross margin, respectively), input prices uncertainty associated with the variety riskiness of the variety  Farm-Level Characteristics climatic and agro-ecological suitability of the location for the variety E.g. quality of the land  Farmer Characteristics agronomic expertise & skills, knowledge about variety, risk aversion, capital availability, access to credit  Institutional Characteristics consumer and market demand for improved varieties  Source: Kopainsky & Derwisch, (2009).  For the purposes of the study and development of the system dynamics model, only the endogenous determinants (those that can be altered depending on the farmers’ level of knowledge and resources and can be changed over time) were considered as described in this section. The only exception in this case was the consideration of input cost because the study 11  identified that income for that matter mater affordability of both climate-smart seed and information has a greater influence on the implementation of the adoption decision. Affordability is relative to the income levels of farmers.   2.4 METHODS OF DETERMINING AGRICULTURE TECHNOLOGY COVERAGE Two approaches can be used in measuring the rate of adoption of any agricultural innovation: in terms of the number of farmers who adopt the innovation and in terms of the total area on which the innovation is implemented or applied. These two measures will yield equivalent results when farm sizes are roughly the same and/or the rate of adoption is constant across farm sizes. There is no rule of thumb indicating which of these two measures is inherently better; one’s choice of either of them is dependent on the issue being addressed (Morris, et al, 1999). If one seeks to determine the number of people who have been affected by an innovation, it is appropriate to find out the proportion of farmers who have adopted the innovation. However, if the aim is to determine the economic benefits resulting from adoption, it is appropriate to find out the percentage of the area affected by adoption (Morris et al 1999). The penetration and utilisation of an innovation is conditioned by adoption and diffusion processes where adoption focuses on what makes a farmer begin to use an innovation and diffusion focuses on the speed of penetration into the potential market. This could be measured in terms of the percentage of total agriculture land area that is cultivated with improved seed or the percentage of farmers that adopt improved seeds (Kopainsky & Derwisch, 2009).  Taking into consideration the objectives of this research, it is not sufficient to only consider the number of farmers who have adopted climate information and climate-smart seed but more importantly how this adoption process affects the livelihoods of these farmers. Thus, the coverage of both climate information and climate-smart seeds are measured in terms of the percentage of land on which these technologies have been implemented.  2.5 CLIMATE-SMART SEED VARIETIES As discussed in chapter one, the severe and incessant climatic stress with its negative impact on food security and livelihood of the African continent has propelled research into climate-smart technologies to save the continent from the dire consequences. In the quest to reduce vulnerability and improve food security, the Drought-Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) project released 160 drought-tolerant maize varieties between 2007 and 2013 which were tried on demonstration grounds to validate their potency and adaptability to environmental conditions (La Rovere et al. 2010). In this guide, Drought-Tolerant Seed Variety (DTSV) designed by DTMA in its pursuit to reduce vulnerability to climate change and variability as climate smart seeds given the following features of this seed variety:  12  To begin with, the maize seed varieties developed by the project are drought-tolerant and have increasing yield potential even under moderate drought conditions, thus ensuring food security whilst raising income for farmers. The varieties are also adaptive such that they enable farmers to cope with more persistent droughts resulting from climate change. Added to that climate-smart seed possess a mitigative potential which helps farmers reduce greenhouse gas emissions by combining the use of drought-tolerant maize with farm management practises such as no-till agriculture. The characteristics of improved seeds that make them climate-smart are illustrated in figure 3. The figure depicts that rising temperature including other changes that come along with climate change could lead to a decrease in the maize growing area by 40% with a looming danger of widespread famine on the African continent and Ghana or the district as vulnerable to these changes such Garu-Tempane is equally highly likely to experience eve worse. However, if there is a paradigm shift from the cultivation of current maize varieties to high yielding climate-smart varieties, food insecurity will be minimised significantly with sustained significant adoption rates. Figure 3: Climate-Smart Seed Source: La Rovere et al. (2010).  Added to that La Rovere et al. (2010) in an assessment of the potential impacts of Drought Tolerant Maize for  Africa  project reports makes it known, the income generating characteristic that qualifies the drought tolerant maize seed as climate-smart. With sustained optimistic adoption rates and yield increases of 10-34% over non-drought-tolerant varieties by 2016 the project could lead to a cumulative economic benefit of nearly USD 0.9 billion to farmers and consumers alike. Drought-tolerant maize variety could assist more than four million people to escape poverty while improving the livelihoods of several millions of people. Moreover, farmers are reporting a percentage increase in yields of 20–30% above what they would attain with traditional varieties, even under moderate drought conditions (ibid). This vision is being implemented in many African countries and in the case of Ghana, Quality Protein Maize was released in Ghana in the early 1990s by the Crops Research Institute, Kumasi (Osei et al. 1999). However, widespread usage followed much later in most parts of the country.   13  2.6 SEED DELIVERY SYSTEM IN GARU-TEMPANE, GHANA Traditionally farmers would usually reserve seeds at harvest for sowing the next season. In the event that a farmer has no seed from the previous season, seeds are obtained from colleague farmers or from local markets. Over time, formal seed systems have emerged but traditional seed system still prevails in most parts of the country (Etwire1 et al, 2016). The informal or traditional seed system refers to the exchange of seeds or obtaining them as gifts or through purchase from local markets (ibid). This system of acquiring seed comprises about 80% of the total seed system for a considerable number of staple crops in Ghana (Louwaars & Boef, 2012). The formal seed system on the other hand is a framework of institutions connected through processes of production, multiplication, storage and marketing of specified quality improved seed varieties along with the interactions and support to provide seed to a particular end user (Etwire1 et a, 2016). Therefore, the formal seed system as described by (Cromwell, et al 1992) is a chain of longitudinal integration of activities from germplasm manipulation and selection to purchasing of seed by final customers through successive generations. The production of improved seed in Ghana is spear headed by the Crop and Scientific Research Institute (CSRI) supported by other producers.    2.7 CROP PRODUCTION IN GARU-TEMPANE DISTRICT Agriculture plays an important role in economic growth, food security, poverty reduction, livelihoods and rural development in Ghana (Ghana Statistical Service, 2008).  Agriculture in Ghana contributes to 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 3/4 of export earnings, and provides employment to 60 percent of the labour force (Breisinger, et al 2009). The sector grows at an average annual rate of 5.5%, a growth rate that has been more rapid than growth in the non-agricultural sectors in recent years (ibid). The main driving factor behind the rapid agricultural growth is the crop subsector dominated by staple crops such as maize, sorghum and rice. This subsector is the largest, contributing to more than two-thirds of the agricultural economy. Breisinger et al (2010) observed that the crop subsector contributed to 75 – 85 percent of agricultural growth between 1991 and 2006.   In Garu-Tempane District, smallholder farmers produce staple crops and livestock as their main livelihood activity. Their purpose of production is to address their immediate food consumption needs before other interests such as selling to raise income (Ibrahim, 2014). Statistics indicate that about 85.2% of the district’s population is engaged in unskilled agricultural forestry and fishery (Garu-Tempane District Assembly, 2014). From the 2014 Medium Term Development Plan of the district, the space economy of the district can be described as principally characterised by mainly the production of subsistence food crops, a few cash crops and livestock/poultry. About 70% of the district’s population is engaged in this 14  subsector producing major crops including millet, maize sorghum, rice, sweet potatoes and groundnuts.   Food crop cultivation in Garu-Tempane is largely possible during the single period of rainfall that occurs between May and August. For the rest of the year, there is less activity since agriculture is rain-fed (Garu-Tempane District Assembly, 2014). Engaged mainly in small-holder rain-fed agriculture, households find it difficult to meet their basic needs   due to unfavourable environmental conditions to support agriculture production even during the main cropping season. This is not surprising because one very crucial factor in agriculture activities; availability of water for agriculture is estimated to have decreased. It is estimated that about 1.55 to 1.65 cubic metres per square area of the rainfall is lost per annum as a result of evapotranspiration from open surfaces partly due to the low vegetative cover and dry nature of the land (Garu-Tempane District Assembly, 2014). Morover, farmers are faced with late start of the rains, reduced amount and erratic distribution of rainfall and temperature extremes has resulted in continuous shift in the crop planting period from early April in the 1960s to late April or early May in recent years (Tonah, 1993: Mensah-Bonsu, 2003)    2.8 MAIZE AS A CASE STUDY Maize is a staple food for more than 300 million people in Africa (La Rovere et al, 2010). Case studies of the Drought-Tolerant Maize for Africa (DTMA) gives it such description as “maize is life” in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) given its relevance for food security as well as economic well-being of majority of the continent’s populace who are largely food crop farmers (ibid). About 40% of Africa’s maize-growing areas have already started experiencing occasional climatic stress resulting in yield losses of 10–25%. Added to that about 25% of the current maize crops suffer recurrent drought leading to crop losses of at least half of the total harvest (ibid).   Maize is the number one crop in Ghana in terms of area planted and accounts for 50-60% of total cereal production. It is the second largest commodity crop cultivated in Ghana after cocoa (Millennium Development Authority, 2010). It accounts for over 20% of incomes earned by smallholder farmers in Ghana (Klutse et al, 2013) and food security not only to smallholder farmers in Ghana. According to Ministry of Food and Agriculture, (2011) it is produced mostly by smallholder resource poor farmers under rain-fed conditions subject to yield fluctuation due principally because it is determined by rainfall changes and to a much lesser extent market forces. Maize production according to Klutse et al, (2013) contributes to about 45% of agricultural production which remains the main source of livelihood for most Ghanaians and it provides employment to more than 60 percent of the population whilst accounting for 30% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 15   During 1997, more than half of Ghana’s maize coverage (53.8%) was planted with improved maize varieties (MVs). Although little reliable data exist that permit comprehensive comparisons with neighbouring countries, adoption is relatively high in comparison with her neighbours of like status where maize is grown mostly by subsistence-oriented farmers. Out of several major crops about 59.7% of the cultivated land is planted with maize in savannah Sahel vegetation zone of Ghana where the study district is located. Maize production has taken more than half the percentage of agriculture land under cultivation (Morris et al, 1999).  In addition to the fact that it is widely-consumed as a food staple, maize is particularly considered important in Ghana from a nutritional point of view. Maize constitutes an important and major component of many widely-patronised weaning foods for infants (ibid). For this reason, the Ghana Grain Development Project (GGDP) has invested considerable effort in breeding Modern Maize Seed Varieties with enhanced nutritional quality to improve the nutritional status of the population.  Varieties such as Obatanpa, released in 1992, is a so-called Quality Protein Maize (QPM) containing the opaque-2 gene, which confers unusually high levels of the amino acids lysine and tryptophan (Morris et al. 1999). It is also acknowledged that commendable effects have been recorded in controlled feeding trials of specialized populations including school children, soldiers and prisoners in Ghana with such variety (Morris et al. 1999). A more comprehensive study done by Afriyie et al., (1998) in Ghanaian children (0-15 months) fed with food supplemented with Quality Protein Maize and normal maize revealed that Quality Protein Maize fed children grew healthier, suffered fewer fatalities with relatively accelerated growth rates Osei et al. (1999) also conclude that QPM is superior to normal maize in terms of its protein content. Mamaba, a drought tolerant variety which is often adopted by subsistence farmers in drought prone areas including Garu-Tempane. As a result of long dry spells and drought, drought tolerant variety including mamaba are often sold in the district. cannot be left out as it also satisfies the drought tolerant characteristic of climate-smart seed.  Judging from above, such improved seed varieties can be considered climate-smart maize thus has a lot of benefits to improving the livelihood of the district. It has the potential not only to combat food insecurity but also improve nutrition associated with several measures of well-being, among which improved health, increased life expectancy, enhanced intellectual capacity, and increased ability to perform physical work cannot be over emphasised.  In conclusion, if subsistence farmers adopted high yielding, drought tolerant varieties described as climate-smart varieties, they will harvest excess food beyond which they can consume and so surplus food can be sold to for income to support household expenditure. 16  CHAPTER THREE  MODEL DOCUMENTATION/DESCRIPTION   3.1 INTRODUCTION This chapter of the thesis describes in detail, the structure of the model. It gives a vivid description of the assumptions based on which the model is developed. The chapter further presents a discussion on how the adoption of climate information and climate-smart seed, agricultural land under cultivation and food inventory operate individually as separate modules. It also discusses how the integrated interactions of these modules of the system culminate in improving the adaptive capacity of farmers to climate change.   3.2 MODEL DESCRIPTION  The model built for this thesis provides answers to how climate change has affected crop yields and its trickledown effect on availability of food, household income and adoption of agriculture technology (climate-smart seed and scientific climate information). Very critical in this study is the focus on dynamic precision rather than numerical precision. As proposed by Sterman (2000), it is more scientific to use one’s judgement to estimate the numerical values of variables that do not have exact numerical values and this estimate is usually very useful in a system than to omit them. “To omit such variables is equivalent to saying they have zero effect-probably the only value that is known to be wrong!” (Forrester 1961, pp. 57). Nevertheless, it is very much important to use reliable statistical methods to estimate the numerical value of parameters in assessing the model’s ability to replicate historical data when numerical data is available. Moreover, this must also be backed by evaluating the sensitivity of one’s results to the uncertainty in the model’s assumptions regardless of whether the model’s parameters are estimated judgmentally or statistical (Sterman, 2000).  3.2.1 Explanatory and Policy Models The core structure of the system described in this section represents the explanatory model of the real system. Central to the explanatory model is the stock; food inventory, average crop yield and the processes involved in refilling the stock through the inflow; harvesting when it is drained through the outflows; consumption and selling. This structure is guided by the stock adjustment/management structure in Sterman (2000). The second section of the system represents the suggested policy options that could be implemented to improve the state of the system. Seed adoption and climate information are at 17  the core of this process. The basic formulation regarding the adoption of climate information and seed adoption is based on the formulation of the Bass diffusion model of adoption of new technology (Sterman, 2000). Equally utilised is the formulations of the Malawi improved maize seed adoption model by Kopainsky et al, (2012).   3.2.2 Model Assumptions This section discusses explicitly the assumptions based on which the model was built and the justification for utilising them in the model Models built without boundaries grow without limit which might render them vague. To prevent this, every model is built with some assumptions that indicate the boundaries beyond which the model may not be applicable. Based on the objective of this study as spelt out in chapter one, the researcher set out four major pillars relevant to this study: food production, agriculture land and adoption (two main stocks of seed and information coverage/share of land) and population. As described in chapter one the reference mode presented earlier and the subsystem diagram in this chapter further consolidates the model boundaries. Figure 4 indicates the four modules crucial to this study: agriculture land under cultivation, food inventory, climate-smart seed adoption module, climate information adoption module and the population module. Figure 4:Sub-System Diagram   Timeframe for Model Simulation Improved seeds were introduced around the 1990s but widespread usage started in 2000 in the study district. The year 2010 is chosen as the base year because, there is no data available for the exact year of its introduction (Garu Tempane District Department of Agriculture, 2016).  18  This informs the choice of 2010 as the base year. This is supported by Sterman (2000), that modellers should trace as far back as data can be found to indicate the reference mode and motivation for the study. This model is simulated for a 20-year period (2010-2030).   Indigenous Seed Variety (ISV) All varieties of indigenous seed are characterised by relatively low yield potential worsened by the continuous changes in climatic conditions. Farmers generally achieve very low crop yields which is a characteristic of the indigenous seed used (Muzari et al., 2012). About 40% of Africa’s maize-growing areas face occasional drought stress, resulting in yield losses of 10-25%. Also, about 25% of the maize crop suffers from frequent drought and farmers experience losses of about half the harvest to drought (La Rovere et al. 2010). The length and amount of rainfall necessary for farmers to realise the full potential of the indigenous seed is non-existence. This greatly affects the wellbeing of households since the expectation of farmers is to obtain at the end of the cultivating season, a harvest sufficient to feed their families and excess sold to take care of household expenditure. Since farmers do not have the capacity to circumvent these challenges, they resort to increasing agriculture land under cultivation but most often due to capacity constraint, this increase is less than the existing gap. A more sustainable approach by District Department of Agriculture has been the introduction of climate-smart seed varieties (drought/flood resistant, early maturing and high yielding crops) as well as the information and management practises that come along with such seed variety to realise its yield potential.  Climate-Smart Seed Variety (CSSV) These are improved seed varieties that has relatively high yield potential compared to indigenous seed varieties. Thus, it has the potential to combat food insecurity whilst improving the income of households which qualifies improved seeds with such characteristics as climate-smart. With sustained optimistic adoption rates and yield increases of 10-34% over non-drought-tolerant varieties by 2016 such seeds could lead to a cumulative economic benefit of nearly USD 0.9 billion to farmers and consumers (La Rovere et al. 2010). It is also estimated that drought-tolerant maize variety could assist more than 4 million people to escape poverty while improving the livelihoods of many millions of people. Moreover, farmers are reporting a percentage increase in yields of 20–30% above what they would have harvested with their traditional varieties, even under moderate drought conditions (ibid).   Climate-Smart Seed Variety, Harvest and Income Nexus It is assumed that when a farmer acquires the seed and climate information and related services, the farmer would obtain a relatively higher yield not necessarily equal to the yield potential of the seed at least for the first time. This conclusion because, maize is not entirely a new crop in the study area and farmers can transfer a considerable amount of knowledge from cultivation of indigenous maize seed. Higher yields would be attained as the famer continues to gain 19  knowledge on the individual level and from group learning added to the information from adoption of climate information and applies it adequately. If the farmer can harvest sufficient food he will be in a better position to meet his domestic food needs with surplus food sold for some income. When income from the sales is increased, income surplus is accrued and then cost of information and seed and other relevant input cost is affordable to the farmer consequently influencing the adoption process. Given that the farmer continues to adopt the technology, food inventories and incomes will increase, eventually leading to breaking away from the vicious cycle of poverty.  Morris et al. (1999) argue that the use of an improved maize variety instead of a local maize seed variety results in a significant yield increase, even if fertilizer is not applied to the improved seed variety during cultivation. This, they found consistent with experimental data showing that well-adapted improved maize variety outperformed local varieties even under unfavourable production conditions. They also observed that when fertilizer is applied to both local and improved maize seed varieties, the size of the increase in yield is significantly greater for the improved maize seed variety relative to the local seed variety. This is attributed to the fact that most improved maize seed varieties have been tailored to respond to unfavourable production conditions. Consequently, if farmers can increase their yield so much with climate-smart seed varieties, they can sell of some because consumption needs will be satisfied to allow for sale of surplus.  Moreover, the fact that the farmer had more produce with the climate-smart seed would improve confidence in the climate-smart seed and this triggers the farmer’s decision to implement the adoption of climate-smart seed during subsequent seasons.  In developing countries like Ethiopia, widespread adoption of yield-enhancing agricultural technologies has been one way to eradicate poverty and to ensure food security. However, adoption of new technologies is not enough but sustained and continuous use of such technology (Tura et al 2010). In spite of the anticipated benefits, the danger is that if unanti
