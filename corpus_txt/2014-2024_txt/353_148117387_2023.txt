Given the volatile global economy, unfriendly policy towards Rus-sia and other external challenges, it is necessary to improve tools for predict-ing threats and risks to regional economic security and resilience. To this end, individual projections and indicators, as well as complex models should be examined.Research objective. The study aims to develop a new differentiated approach to diagnostics of indicators (projections) of economic security and resilience at the regional level, which can help visualize and evaluate threats to economic meso-systems. Data and Methods. Comparative and indicative approaches, ranking, piecewise linear approximation (scaling) and correlation analysis were used in the study.Results. As a result, the study presents the author’s system of indicators of eco-nomic security and risks to the regional economy based on a differentiated ap-proach. 36 indicators were grouped into 4 projections – general economic, social, technological and financial – and divided into sub-projections. In order to pro-vide adequate and comparable estimates in the regional and temporal context, various methodological principles were used: application of relative indicators; assessment of cost indicators of regional development using the number of fixed market baskets (FMB) of the region (ratio of the regional cost indicator and the cost of a fixed market basket). Such approach allowed us to evaluate regional eco-nomic security in dynamics. The diagnostics of resilience of regional economic systems was performed in the context of individual projections by comparing crisis and relatively stable periods. Conclusions. The methodology was tested using data from regions of the Volga Federal District. The study revealed specific projections, sub-projections and in-dicators affected by threats, as well as demonstrated the ability of regions of the Volga Federal District to face the crisis and, in particular, resist sanctions.KEYWORDSeconomic security, threats, indicators, socio-economic system of the region, projections, diagnostics, differentiated approach, resilience, sanction factorsACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe article has been prepared in the framework of the project “Develop-ment and substantiation of the con-cept, integrated model of resilience diagnostics of risks and threats to the security of regional ecosystems and technology of its application based on a digital twin” (grant of the President of the Russian Federation NSh-5187.2022.2 for state support of leading scientific schools of the Russian Federation).FOR CITATIONKaranina, E.V., & Karaulov, V.M.

R-economy, 9(1), 19–37. doi: 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002IntroductionGiven the volatile global economy, imposed sanctions, COVID-19 spread and other external challenges, nowadays it becomes important to en-sure economic security of national and regional systems in Russia. The present study examines economic secu-rity of regional systems and its projections, eco-nomic and mathematical methods and tools for predicting risks and threats to regional economic security and resilience in the context of economic sanctions and crisis. 21 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731The National Economic Security Strategy de-fines a threat to economic security of the Russian Federation as “the set of conditions and factors creating a direct or indirect possibility of harm to national interests”. Economic security risk is “the possibility of harming national interests of the Russian Federation associated with the implemen-tation of the threat to economic security”1. Thus, a set of negative factors can be seen as a threat to economic security, while probabilistic damage as-sessment can be considered as economic security risk, evidenced by decreasing indicator values. For instance, a decline in gross national product (GDP) poses a threat, and negative GDP dynamics char-acterizes a risk of a decrease in economic security.In this study, the following concept is used as a key one. Economic security of the region is a cat-egory characterizing the system’s ability to operate sustainably for a long time, including in the context of negative external influence. Economic security of the system is defined through the realization of its potential, taking into account the external influ-ences. Realization of the long-term potential of the economic system depends on the current external environment. The potential of the system should correspond to the average level of external threats, meaning that the relationship between the potential and external threats characterize the security of the whole system. The potential should be sufficient to reduce the negative external influence and ensure sustainable operation of the system. In this case, it is possible to talk about high level of economic se-curity. Comparison of the current system with its baseline state (long-term average state of the system in the absence of negative external influence) can define the level of economic security in any given moment. In order to assess the resilience of the sys-tem, the rate of recovery to the previous level of eco-nomic security (after an increase in external threats) should be compared with the baseline period.Various studies focused on predicting the impact of external factors on security and re-silience of regional socio-economic systems; in 2020, particular attention was paid to assessing the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Pobe-din, Balynskaya & Williams, 2021; Romanova & Ponomareva, 2021; Turgel & Usoltseva, 2020).In addition to the virus, external threats include the sanctions imposed on Russia by other states, which significantly affected the economic devel-1 Order of the President of the Russian Federation of May 13, 2017 No. 208. “On the Russian Federation Economic Security Strategy until 2030”.

To consider their influence, several studies analyzed observations at equal time intervals to compare sanction and rela-tively stable periods (Glazyev & Arkhipova, 2018; Minat & Polyakov, 2018; Gladkov, 2017).Numerous approaches to predicting indicators are present in the modern theory and methodology of economic security. To improve the diagnostics of economic security at the national and regional lev-el, it is required to create a set of indicators (that can be grouped into projections) and establish a thresh-old for their assessment. The number of both pro-jections and indicators can differ depending on the methodology used. The present article offers a new differentiated approach to diagnostics of threats and risks to economic security and resilience at the regional level. It can help visualize and evaluate threats to economic meso-systems. The developed approach can be applied to assess economic securi-ty of regional systems and its projections based on the economic and mathematical methods and tools for predicting threats and risks to regional econom-ic security and resilience in the context of economic sanctions and crisis. Using the scoring system, we defined points for security projections (group as-sessment) and the final (integral) assessment. Ac-cordingly, three levels of economic security were distinguished: dangerous state – high risk of a sig-nificant decline in economic security; safe state – high level of economic security, low risk of stability deterioration; intermediate (uncertain) state – neg-ligible risk of a decline in economic security. The concept of economic security and resil-ience of regional systems based on a historical approach is applied to demonstrate the systems’ resistance to 2022 sanctions and other external challenges, identify their strengths and weakness-es, indicate risks and threats to economic security of the constituent entities of the Russian Federa-tion and the duration of adverse effects.Theoretical basisBoth Russian and foreign scientists have in-vestigated the issues of monitoring and diagnostics of economic security. For example, European au-thors often pay special attention to circular econ-omy monitoring (Alaerts, Acker & Rousse, 2019; Avdiushchenko, 2018; Llorente-González & Vence, 2019). Katsikaris and Parcharidis (2010) examined indicators of social monitoring. There are also well-known studies on the development of financial sta-bility monitoring (Adrian, Covitz & Liang, 2015). 22 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731Combinations and differences between the concepts “monitoring” and “diagnostics” are giv-en sufficient attention in several works. For in-stance, the Cambridge Dictionary defines the verb “to monitor” as follows: to watch and check a situation carefully for a period of time. The term “diagnostics” comes from the Greek “diagnostikos”, which literally means “the ability to recognize threats.” Thus, based on the initial definitions, it can be established that “monitoring” and “diagnostics” are different concepts. “Moni-toring” is associated with supervision or control of an object, while the concept of “diagnostics” is linked with the subject’s ability to identify and as-sess risks and threats. Scientific literature presents the following combinations of the concepts “monitoring” and “diagnostics”:1) diagnostics is one of the stages (dimen-sions) of monitoring (Yushchuk, 2019);2) monitoring is one of the stages of diagnos-tics (Khoroshko, 2011);3) monitoring as a kind of diagnostics.Most researchers of financial and economic security, including Baidova and Kopylova (2020), support the first statement and consider diagnos-tics as the process of determining the state of an object, object, phenomenon or management by using a number of procedures in order to identify the most dangerous threats and vulnerabilities. Diagnostics aims to determine the actual state of the research object. Simultaneously, Baidova and Kopylova define monitoring as the technol-ogy of continuous and regular observation and analysis of a phenomenon or process. In contrast to diagnostics, monitoring allows researchers to compare data obtained at different time intervals, determine certain relationships between variables using the correlation approach and identify dy-namic trends of these relationships.Lyaushina and Sergeev (2018) as well as Mi-nakov and Lapina (2021) adhere to a similar ap-proach, stating that monitoring includes two key dimensions: diagnostics of economic security and reaction to the identified violations and de-viations. Minakov and Lapina (2021) point out that monitoring is aimed not only at assessing the severity of risks, but also at predicting the emer-gence of new risks or an increase in existing ones.Noskova (2020) also considers diagnostics to be part of the monitoring process, which includes the assessment of security, as well as strategic planning measures.In particular, it is necessary to consider the view of scientists of the Financial University un-der the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation on the relationship between the definitions of “monitoring” and “di-agnostics”. From their perspective, diagnostics is a process focusing on determining the actual state of the research object by using various analytical procedures, while monitoring is defined as “con-stant surveillance of a process in order to deter-mine whether it corresponds to the desired result or initial assumptions” (Zemskov et al., 2020). Scholars of our research school (Karanina & Loginov, 2017; Karanina & Kartavyh, 2017; Logi-nov et al., 2017) also participated in studies in the field of diagnostics and monitoring of risks and threats to economic security of the regions. The author’s proposed approach uses monitoring for ranking economic security in the context of in-dividual projections, regions, periods and other parameters. Dynamic monitoring can help deter-mine the level of security and its variation over time, as well as assess stability and variability rela-tive to the average/threshold security.Several studies examined the issues of diag-nostics of security indicators and creation of pro-jections taking into account factors and signals of crisis and sustainable development (Chichkanov, Belyaevskaya-Plotnik & Andreeva, 2020; Vasilye-va & Vasileva, 2022; Ignatieva, Mariev & Serkova, 2020; Zubarevich, 2020; Kuznetsova, 2014).In the present study, we propose to use a sys-tem of indicators (projections) of economic secu-rity and risks of the regional economy grouped as follows: general economic, social, technological and financial projections. To provide adequate and comparable esti-mates in the regional and temporal context, we selected the methodological principles presented by Kislitsyna et al. (2017):1) to use, if possible, relative indicators;2) to assess indicators of regional economic development in terms of per capita;3) to assess cost indicators of regional devel-opment using the number of fixed market baskets (FMB) of the region (ratio of the regional cost in-dicator and the cost of a fixed market basket).Due to the transformations of the indicators, we can assess the risk and economic security of regions taking into account their regional char-acteristics (regardless of the region’s size and the current price level). On the other hand, there is a possibility of diachronous comparison.23 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731Data and methodsThe system of regional economic indicators is based on characteristics that can be found in open sources. In particular, this study mostly uses data obtained from the collection “Regions of Russia. So-cial and economic indicators” and its appendices2. Selected indicators show two dimensions of economic security: security of the whole system (regional economy in general) and its most im-portant elements (economic security of producers and consumers, including security of the regional population). High, low and intermediate levels of econom-ic security (or risks that are economic distress sig-nals) were distinguished. These levels of economic security were determined by individual indicators using two threshold values. Threshold values can be established in different ways. First, it is possi-ble to use target indicators set by regulatory doc-2 Regions of Russia. Social and economic indicators. Appendix to the collection “Regions of Russia. Social and economic indicators”. Retrieved from: https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/pril-region2021.rar (In Russ.)uments or various socio-economic development programs. Another approach to the establishment of threshold values involves setting realistically achievable levels of security in the constituent en-tities of the Russian Federation, which can be fur-ther incorporated into regional development pro-grams for managing economic security. To this end, thresholds for some indicators of economic security can be determined using average Russian (or average for the federal district) values. In this case, indicators of economic security can be inter-preted as follows: economic security is considered sufficient if the value of the examined indicator is higher than the average Russian (average for the federal district) value, possibly with some margin. Tables 1-4 below present characteristics and indicators calculated on their basis for four pro-jections of economic security. In particular, Table 1 includes characteristics and indicators of general economic security. In this study, numerical values of economic security of the region are considered as indicators, calculated on the basis of character-istics – statistical data from open sources.Table 1 Characteristics and indicators of general economic security of the regionSymbol Used characteristic  (from open sources) SymbolModel indicator  (calculated based on characteristics)Calculation  of the indicatorEconomic development security of the regionC1.1 Gross regional product (GRP) per capita (RUB) I1.1 GRP per capita (fixed market baskets) C1.1 / C1.11 C1.2 GRP volume index (in constant pric-es;

Additionally, three sub-projections of economic security can be distin-guished in every projection, thus, it is possible to assess economic security of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation using 12 sub-projections.The proposed basic system of indicators can be used not only for analyzing the impact of sanc-tions imposed on the Russian Federation, but for examining the country’s resistance to external shocks, including the spread of coronavirus. Oth-er indicators of economic security can be added to the basic model; for example, in this article, we study the influence of the indicators of foreign economic activity on the basic model.To compare different indicators, their values were converted into a scoring scale, ranging from 1 to 100 points. 100 points indicate full economic secu-rity; 1 point means low economic security and a high risk of instability in the functioning of the regional economy according to the measured indicator. To establish the scale, the piecewise linear ap-proximation (scaling) was used for converting the indicator values. It is assumed that when indica-tor values change from the minimum to the max-imum possible values, the impact of the assessed factor on economic security can be represented graphically as an S-shaped curve. In particular, sufficiently small values of the factor (indicator) demonstrate the lack of economic security, while sufficiently large values mean the provision of economic security necessary. This curve can be approximated by a piecewise linear function (graph). The function is defined on an interval of real numbers (indicator values) and changes linearly between two threshold values. Thus, it is necessary to identify adequate threshold values in order to define intervals indicating chang-es in economic security. In this research, threshold values are established using target indicators set by regulatory documents or various socio-economic development programs, scientific and expert stud-ies. Threshold values are fixed deviations from the average Russian indicators noted in the period of relatively stable positive development. To deter-mine the threshold values, the round number bias was taken into account. For example, for dynam-ics indicators, the lower threshold corresponds to the index 100 (as a percentage), while the upper threshold is 106. Thus, dynamics is considered low below 102, average in the interval from 102 to 104 and high if the index is above 104.If the initial value of the indicator is 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 and its threshold values are 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎  and 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 , then the score of the indicator 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 is calculated as follows (given that larger values of 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 indicate a higher level of security): If 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 < 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎, then 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 = 1 (points); If 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 > 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏, then 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 = 100 (points); Otherwise 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 = 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏−𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎 ⋅ 99 + 1 (points). In case a larger value 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 means a lower level of economic security, the calculation changes: If 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 < 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎, then 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 = 100 (points); If 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥 > 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏, then 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 = 1 (points); Otherwise 𝑦𝑦𝑦𝑦 = (1 − 𝑥𝑥𝑥𝑥−𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏−𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎) ⋅ 99 + 1 (points). Using the score of the indicators, we deter-mined the points for security projections (group assessment) as the arithmetic mean. Then, based on the values of economic security for all projec-tions, the integral (final) indicator of economic security (IIES) of the region was calculated as the geometric mean. A simple arithmetic mean with-in one projection was used, since the indicators of the same projection can be quite strongly intercon-nected. Weighting coefficients would not be of use here, as the indicator values in one group are mu-tually compensated due to a significant number of indicators. On the contrary, indicators of different projections characterize various aspects of eco-nomic security. In this case, the low values of some projections should not be compensated by the high values of others. Thus, it is appropriate to use the geometric mean for assessing the integral indicator.Continuation of the table 427 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731For measuring qualitative characteristics of various aspects of economic security, we defined two threshold levels: 34 and 67 points: ● 34 or less points – dangerous state, high risk of a significant decline in economic security; ● 67 points or more – safe state, high level of economic security, low risk of stability deteriora-tion and decline in economic security;● from 34 to 67 points – intermediate (uncer-tain) state, negligible risk of a decline in economic security.This technique can be used for both individ-ual indicators and group assessments, including projections (sub-projections) the final (integral) assessment of economic security.This study considers years 2010-2013 as the baseline period. In 2014, foreign countries im-posed sanctions against the Russian Federation due to the events in Ukraine, as well as Sevastopol and the Republic of Crimea becoming part of the Russian Federation. Analysis of economic security in 2014-2016 and subsequent years demonstrates the ability of regional systems to resist sanctions, identifies their strengths and weaknesses, esti-mates the resilience of the system as the rate of re-covery to the previous level of economic security. It can be assumed that regional economic securi-ty systems can react similarly in connection with the 2022 events and the introduction of sanctions packages imposing further restrictions. Sanctions primarily affect foreign economic relations of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, namely, export, import and financial transactions. In particular, decline in net foreign investment to Russian regions, reduction in trade with non-CIS countries, increase in the share of trade with the CIS countries are expected.  It should be noted that while the share of trade between Rus-sia as a whole and the CIS countries changes insig-nificantly during the study period (the impact of the 2014 events is unnoticeable), different situation is observed in individual regions. Thus, the influ-ence of sanctions on regional development is an important factor. In order to assess the short-term impact, correlation analysis was applied to examine the relationship between current indicators of for-eign economic activity and indicators of economic security for the current and next year.ResultsThe proposed methodology was tested using data from regions of the Volga Federal District (VFD) and the Russian Federation as a whole for the period 2010-2020. In some cases, missing baseline data were replaced by estimates.Average values of indicators for the Russian Federation and the Volga Federal District, their coefficients of variation, threshold deviations from the average Russian indicators and thresholds of economic security are presented in Table 5.Table 5Average values of indicators (m) in the Russian Federation for 2010-2019, their variation  (coefficient of variation V) and threshold of economic security (lower – a and upper – b)4IndicatorRussian Federation Threshold Threshold deviation  from m РФ Share of VFD m in RF m Average, m V = σ/m Lower, a Upper, b a from m b from mI1 General economic (GES)I1.1. 35.5 8.3% 28.0 units 40.0 units -21.1% 12.7% 82.7%I1.2 102.3 1.7% 100.0% 106.0% -2.2% 3.6% 100.2%I1.3 102.7 2.8% 100.0% 106.0% -2.6% 3.2% 100.5%I1.4 102.8 8.6% 100.0% 106.0% -2.7% 3.1% 99.7%I1.5 2.32 6.2% 1.80 units 3.00 units -22.4% 29.3% 127.6%I1.6 17.7 7.9% 13.0 units 22.0 units -26.5% 24.3% 115.6%I1.7 2.24 3.8% 2.00 units 2.60 units -10.7% 16.1% 92.5%I1.8 101.1 3.5% 100.0% 106.0% -1.1% 4.8% 99.6%I1.9 1.74 6.5% 1.40 units 2.00 units -19.4% 15.1% 93.6%I2 Social (SS)I2.1 0.27 202.0% -0.15% 0.15% -87.3%I2.2 100.5 2.0% 98.5% 101.5% -2.0% 0.9% 98.8%I2.3 720.1 8.7% 650 people 800 people -9.7% 11.1% 102.6%28 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731IndicatorRussian Federation Threshold Threshold deviation  from m РФ Share of VFD m in RF m Average, m V = σ/m Lower, a Upper, b a from m b from mI2.4 6.7 19.2% 4.5 children 5.7 children National Project Healthcare 92.4%I2.5 65.8 2.6% 62.5 years 70.4 years -5.0% 7.0% 98.6%I2.6 76.7 1.4% 72.8 years 82.0 years -5.0% 7.0% 99.8%I2.7 12.2 7.9% 7.0% 16.0% Target 7-10 105.0%I2.8 5.6 14.3% 3.5% 8.0% Target < 4 92.8%I2.9 33.2 4.6% 28.0% 40.0% -15.6% 20.6% 100.0%I3 Technological (TS)I3.1 22.3 10.2% 15.0% 30.0% -32.8% 34.3% 104.3%I3.2 46.8 6.9% 45.0% 60.0% -3.8% 28.3% 109.2%I3.3 102.0 1.6% 100.0% 106.0% -2.0% 3.9% 101.1%I3.4 11.0 19.0% 10.0% 25.0% Target 112.7%I3.5 5.34 17.0% 8.0% 20.0% Target 227.3%I3.6 19.2 3.0% 15.0% 30.0% -21.8% 56.3% 119.7%I3.7 49.9 6.4% 45.0% 60.0% -9.8% 20.2% 100.6%I3.8 3.5 13.0% 2.5 т 4.0 т -29.3% 13.1% 83.0%I3.9 2.9 17.1% 2.0 th. m3 3.5 th.m3 -30.7% 21.3% 102.7%I4 Financial (FS)I4.1 14.0 23.4% 7.0% 16.0% -49.8% 14.7% 76.0%I4.2 31.3 4.9% 24.0% 36.0% -23.2% 15.2% 93.6%I4.3 15.2 10.8% 12.0% 18.0% -21.2% 18.2% 98.6%I4.4 -1.66 -9.0%-0.0% 1.0%-10.0% Target [-3%; 4%] 219.8%I4.5 171.3 34.2% 100.0% 400.0% -41.6% 133.4% 150.4%I4.6 17.5 8.4% 12.0% 24.0% -31.4% 37.1% 86.8%I4.7 10.3 10.0% 16.0% 40.0% -44.8% 37.9% 81.4%I4.8 5.1 24.1% 16.0% 40.0% -15.1% 112.2% 109.7%I4.9 6.8 50.4% 2.0% 11.0% -70.4% 63.0% 95.0%Source: compiled by the authors44 The coefficient of variation V is calculated using the formula: V = σ/m, where σ is the mean square deviation of the indicator for 2010-2019, and m is its average value. In the General economic indicators group, the thresholds of five indicators are measured as the number of fixed market baskets (units) of the constituent entity.During the study period, the changes in general economic indicators across Russian regions were in-significant, as indicated by the low coefficient of vari-ation (less than 10%). Social indicators differ more significantly. In particular, moderate coefficient of variation was observed for two indicators, while the indicator I2.1 “Population change” was character-ized by high variation (more than 200%) due to Sev-astopol and the Republic of Crimea becoming part of the Russian Federation. For this reason, estimates of threshold deviations from the average population change for 2010-2019 are not presented.Low and moderate coefficients of variation are characteristic of technological indicators. Indicators of the financial projection are the most volatile: high coefficients of variation (more than 25%) are record-ed for two of them. The coefficient of variation is different for the indicator I4.4 “Ratio of balance and consolidated budget revenues of the constituent enti-ty”, since it has both positive and negative values, for which thresholds should be established separately. Further, we present the results of the diagnos-tics of individual projections and integral level of economic security (using data from regions of the Volga Federal District).Table 6 includes indicators for assessing the dynamics of the integral indicator in the “General economic security” projection.Continuation of the table 529 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731Table 6Assessing economic security of regions of the Volga Federal District: “General economic security” projectionRegions \\\\ year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Russian Federation 42 60 53 56 42 33 40 44 48 57 33Volga Federal District 46 61 59 56 46 29 35 38 36 51 36Republic of Bashkortostan 59 75 77 76 47 40 29 42 37 49 29Mari El Republic 40 46 57 38 55 45 14 31 32 40 20Republic of Mordovia 43 40 35 24 53 25 36 37 30 45 43Republic of Tatarstan 77 92 88 68 72 66 73 70 66 75 59Udmurt Republic 41 46 34 31 37 29 31 16 31 30 23Chuvash Republic 33 45 45 15 23 20 17 17 16 40 19Perm Krai 45 63 40 49 48 30 20 34 36 32 30Kirov Oblast 34 37 20 5 36 11 20 9 23 14 26Nizhny Novgorod Oblast 46 53 49 50 45 29 29 33 29 54 28Orenburg Oblast 44 45 38 51 32 20 28 36 31 38 32Penza Oblast 32 45 46 50 43 39 31 28 31 40 41Samara Oblast 51 56 63 57 38 23 30 28 27 45 34Saratov Oblast 30 45 41 46 37 20 26 31 21 29 37Ulyanovsk Oblast 32 43 29 32 23 13 25 32 8 28 24Source: compiled by the authorsIn the second half of the study period, a de-crease in economic security in the “General eco-nomic security” projection is observed. The main reason for that is the introduction of sanctions in 2014 due to Sevastopol and the Republic of Crimea becoming part of the Russian Federation. In general, economic security of the country and the Volga Federal District declined to dangerous levels in 2015, but it reached the intermediate lev-el in 2016. By 2019, economic security returned to its pre-sanctions level. However, security risks are unevenly distributed among regions of the Volga Federal District. According to the “General economic security” projection, economic security in the Republic of Tatarstan slightly declined, but remained high or close to high. In the majority of other constituent entities, economic security declined from intermediate to dangerous levels (less than 34 points); only half of them managed to recover and return to the intermediate state by 2019. In 2020, economic security of numer-ous constituent entities (and of Russia in general) once again declined to a dangerous level due to the negative influence of the spread of coronavi-rus and introduction of quarantine measures. Dy-namics of the “General economic security” pro-jection for regions of the Volga Federal District is shown in Figure 1.Assessment of economic security and risks of regions of the Volga Federal District in 2010-2020 for the “Financial security” projection is present-ed in Table 7.During the study period, general financial security of all regions of the Volga Federal Dis-trict remained at the intermediate level. Nev-ertheless, the situation developed in different ways in terms of individual projections. For instance, values of the “Debt for loans granted by credit institutions to individuals per capi-ta” indicator declined from safe (for all regions of the Volga Federal District in the beginning of the study period) to dangerous levels in 12 constituent entities in 2020. Simultaneously, the situation improved in terms of price growth. Financial security is quite sensitive to negative effects. The sanctions policy greatly affected fi-nancial security of regions of the Volga Feder-al District in 2014 leading to its decline. After a couple of years, financial security completely recovered in some constituent entities, and re-mained at a lower level in others.  Collective de-clines in financial security also were recorded in 2018 and 2020 due to the negative impact of the COVID-19 spread. Dynamics of the “Financial security” projection is presented in Figure 2.30 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731Figure 1.

This percentage has not increased significantly: the 2017-2019 annual indicator is 2.5 times less than the 2011-2013 average indicator, while the 2020 indicator decreased by 6 times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The situation developed differently in regions of the Volga Federal Dis-trict. For example, in Ulyanovsk oblast, posi-tive net foreign direct investment increased by 3 times in 2014-2016, and then decreased by almost 8 times in 2017-2019 compared to the period 2011-2013. In the Republic of Tatarstan, this indicator first increased by 70%, and then exceeded twice the value of 2011-2013. In Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, positive net foreign direct investment decreased by almost 2 times, and then became negative.More indicative of the impact of sanctions is the indicator of per capita trade with non-CIS countries. This indicator grew only in Ulyanovsk oblast; as for the remaining 13 regions, the indi-cator decreased by more than 10% in 11 constit-uent entities and by more than 20 % in 7 regions. In the Republic of Bashkortostan, Udmurt Re-public, Orenburg oblast and Samara oblast, the average annual indicator continued to decline in 2017-2019. In the Republic of Mordovia and Penza oblast, however, the indicator recovered and even increased by a third compared to the pre-sanction level. In general, introduction of sanctions did not lead to a significant increase in trade with the CIS countries: the share of trade remained relatively stable or unstable in various constituent entities. In particular, 6 regions of the Volga Federal District are characterized by vol-atile changes in the share of trade (coefficient of variation is 30% or more) (Figure 3).Figure 3. Share of trade between regions of the Volga Federal District and the CIS countriesSource: compiled by the authorsContinuation of the table 833 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731Correlation study of the influence of foreign economic activity on economic security shows that the change in per capita trade with non-CIS countries has a direct tangible (absolute value of the correlation coefficient is at least 0.5) short-term impact on the integral indicator of economic security in the current year in the Russian Federa-tion, the Volga Federal District and 8 regions of the Volga Federal District. However, with a one-year lag, the tangible impact was observed only in the Chuvash Republic and Saratov oblast. The impact on general economic security is similar or slightly higher. Per capita trade with non-CIS countries has a longer lasting effect on technological secu-rity. In the current period, it has an inverse and negligible effect (absolute value of correlation co-efficient is less than 0.3) in the Russian Federation and the Volga Federal District, becoming tangible with a one-year lag. In regions of the Volga Fed-eral District, significant correlation is observed in 5 regions in the current period, and in 7 regions with a one-year lag. Simultaneously, either direct or inverse (not necessarily short-term) correla-tion can be observed.The effect of net foreign direct investment per capita on economic security is less pronounced and somewhat different. In general, this indica-tor has a tangible impact on the integral indica-tor of economic security, as well as on projections of general economic security, social security and financial security across the Russian Federation. In the Volga Federal District, it has a tangible im-pact only on social security with a one-year lag. As for regions of the Volga Federal District, the studied indicator has a tangible but multi-direc-tional impact with a one-year lag on the indicator of economic security (5 regions), social security (4 regions) and technological security (4 regions).Based on the correlation analysis, it is pos-sible to predict the impact of 2022 sanctions on economic security of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. Sanctions significantly affect foreign economic activity of the constitu-ent entities of the Russian Federation, trade and net foreign direct investment may decrease sever-al times. This impact on the integral indicator of economic security and general economic security is usually short-term (during the current year). Figure 4. Correlation between the trade volume with non-CIS countries per capita and economic securitySource: compiled by the authors34 r-economy.comR-ECONOMY, 2023, 9(1), 19–37 doi 10.15826/recon.2023.9.1.002Online ISSN 2412-0731As for individual regions, the effect may be multi-directional and last longer. The effect on technological security may not be immediately obvious; it also may be multi-directional and last longer. Feedback can indicate the implementa-tion of import substitution policy in regions. The structure of trade has a significant impact on eco-nomic security of regions, usually with a time lag, especially on technological security. On the other hand, sanctions did not lead to growth in trade with the CIS countries, as the share of trade re-mained the same across the Russian Federation. Dynamics of net foreign direct investment per capita significantly affects short-term financial security. Simultaneously, financial security influ-ences technological security with a one-year lag.The COVID-19 spread in 2020, as well as in-troduction of sanctions significantly limited for-eign economic activity. Thus, indicators of eco-nomic security recovery in 2021 can be used to predict the possibility of restoring economic se-curity of Russian regions affected by international sanctions in 2022. The proposed differentiated ap-proach takes into account sustainability and eco-nomic security of various regions, as well as their ability to respond to external threats.ConclusionsThe proposed approach to diagnostics can be applied to evaluate economic security of the con-stituent entities of the Russian Federation, iden-tify emerging risks, compare them and study in dynamics. Additionally, it can be used to assess the sustainability of the economic security sys-tem and the ability of regional economy to adapt to negative external challenges, in particular, the 2014 sanctions affecting economic development of regions of the Volga Federal District.In general, intermediate level of security re-gions in terms of resilience was characteristic for all regions of the Volga Federal District (with the exception of Kirov oblast) until 2014. In 2014-2015, however, the values of 5 constituent entities decreased to dangerous levels. By 2019, economic security in terms of its integral indicator returned to the intermediate level in all regions of the Vol-ga Federal District. During the study period, economic security in the Republic of Tatarstan Figure 5.

Thus, external challenges practically do not affect economic se-curity of the Republic, which can be considered the most resilient. Decrease in financial security of the regions in 2014-2015 after a year caused a decline in tech-nological security. However, increase in techno-logical security will not necessarily lead to the recovery of technological security; moreover, this decline may continue. Sanctions affect indicators of foreign econom-ic activity, in particular, trade volume with non-CIS countries per capita and net foreign direct in-vestment per capita. The impact on the structure of trade (the share of trade with the CIS countries) is insignificant. Changes in trade with non-CIS countries in the current period have a tangible im-pact of the integral indicator of economic security and general economic security. After a year, such an impact becomes insignificant. The impact on technological security, however, usually becomes evident after one year. Changes in net foreign di-rect investment significantly affect financial secu-rity in the current period. Since the introduction of COVID-19 restric-tions in 2020 led to a weakening of foreign econom-ic and trade relations, the ability of regional systems to restore economic security in 2021 can be used to predict the possibility of restoring economic securi-ty affected by international sanctions in 2022.ReferencesAdrian, T., Covitz, D., & Liang, N.
