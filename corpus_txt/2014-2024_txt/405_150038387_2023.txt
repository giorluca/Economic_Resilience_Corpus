Brine pre-treatment is important to remove species that may impair the performance of other technologies involved and to increase recovery effi-ciencies. Hence, nanofiltration and calcium precipitation were proposed as pre-treatment stages. Nanofiltration was studied to separate monovalent from multivalent elements (Fonsalía desalination plant case study), while economically, it was evaluated whether it would be better to place it before (Scenario 1) or after (Scenario 2) a Ca(II) precipitation stage, considering that Ca(II) can produce scaling in membranes. Three commercial mem-branes were tested using synthetic brines at 30 bar. Experiments (65 % permeate recovery) showed that Fortilife XC-N and PRO-XS2 membranes presented higher Ca(II) and Mg(II) rejection than NF270. Heating the brine for Ca(II) precipitation jeopardizes the economic feasibility of the project. Scenario 1 was the best configuration since it presented lower total levelized cost (≈1.6 €/m3 inlet, without heating the brine for Ca(II) removal). In such scenario, PRO-XS2 reported the best selectivity between monovalent and multivalent elements.  * Corresponding author at: Chemical Engineering Department, Escola d'Enginyeria de Barcelona Est (EEBE), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)-Barce-lonaTECH, C/Eduard Maristany 10-14, Campus Diagonal-Besòs, 08930 Barcelona, Spain.

Introduction It is estimated that >90 % of biodiversity loss and water stress [1] and 10 % of total greenhouse gas emissions (57.6 Gt CO2 eq/y in 2018 [2]) come from resource extraction and processing. The transition to a circular economy model, where the life cycle of materials is extended and the waste is reduced to a minimum, is essential for European Union (EU) to develop a sustainable, low carbon, resource efficient and competitive economy [3]. Besides the environmental benefits, this transition gives competitive advantages by protecting businesses against scarcity of resources and volatile prices [4]. At the moment, the EU is lacking primary resources for several materials that are necessary for its economy, and the main input for them come from non-EU countries. To reduce the dependence on importations, the EU has created a list of Critical Raw Materials, which includes those elements of economic importance and high supply risk, such as borate, magnesium, and va-nadium, among others [5]. This is aligned with the circular economy schemes that EU is promoting, as it aims to recover these critical ma-terials from secondary sources. In the last years, the concept of seawater mining has emerged, which is devoted to the recovery of critical raw materials from concentrated brines, such as seawater reverse osmosis (RO) brines [6]. Nowadays, about 74 % of global desalination installed capacity use RO technology [7]. RO is a pressure-driven membrane technology based on the use of a semi-permeable barrier that allows water transport while the perme-ation of salts is hindered. Therefore, purified water is obtained as permeate [8]. Nevertheless, the rejected brine (with approximately twice the concentration of the feed solution) is usually discharged into the sea, having adverse effects on the marine ecosystems. However, this brine can be used as a secondary source for the recovery of critical raw materials with a suitable selection of recovery technologies. Searching for improved brine management strategies within the framework of circular economy and to promote the recovery of sec-ondary raw materials from seawater, the European Union's Horizon 2020 Sea4Value project (https://sea4value.eu/) is under development. The project aims to recover valuable minerals and metals from seawater desalination plant (SWDP) brines, focusing on B(III), Mg(II), Ca(II), Sc (III), V(V), In(III), Ga(III), Li(I), Mo(VI), and Rb(I), most of them included in the EU's critical raw materials list. The project relies on three principles: to apply a circular supply model, to develop highly efficient separation technologies and, to integrate these and existing technologies into a multi-mineral modular brine mining process able to obtain mul-tiple resources at the same time [9]. In recent decades, with the growth in the number of SWDPs, research related to the recovery of valuable raw materials from the brines generated has increased. However, most literature focus on species abundant in seawater (major elements, at g/L levels). Fewer studies have been published regarding the recovery of the minor (10 mg/L or less) minerals and metals present in brines (such as Li(II) [10], Rb(I) [11] and B(III) [12]). In this sense, Kumar et al. [13] performed an evaluation of the recovery of elements from seawater brine based on the market price of the element, extraction cost and concentration in brine. It resulted in the feasibility of extracting target elements such as B(III) and Rb(I), highlighting Mg(II) and Li(I) with greater economic potential, which are the ones that are expected to be recovered within the Sea4-Value project. Khalil et al. estimate that worldwide about 1.5 million EUR are daily thrown back to the oceans as waste considering just the Li present in SWDP brine [14]. However, most of the published works are focused on extracting one or two elements and are still at initial level (lab-scale). The Sea4Value project (developed under the umbrella of EU through the Critical Raw Materials Action Plan) aims to bring these technologies to a higher technology readiness level (TRL) by developing a multi-mineral mining process. It is worth commenting on the effect of low concentrations of ele-ments in compromising the economic viability of extraction. In fact, the operating and maintenance costs of the extraction must be compensated with the recoverable amount of the element and its market price. In this regard, large flow rates are crucial for an affordable extraction of potentially profitable compounds, especially when market prices are also remarkably high. Shahmansouri et al. reported that elements such as Rb(II), Li(I), Si(IV), Sr(II) and Cs(I) would be profitable to extract for flow rates above 50,000 m3/d. However, Rb(II) would be economically feasible to extract at flow rates below 5,000 m3/d [15]. In addition, other authors reached similar conclusions stating that B(III) (1–10 ppm) and Li(I) (0.1 ppm) were within the limits of profitable elements for extraction. Other elements (Mo(VI), V(V) and Ga(III)) with higher market values but lower concentrations showed economic challenges to reach a profitable extraction [13]. The proposed pre-treatment of this brine mining process consists of a nanofiltration (NF) and a calcium removal stage. The pre-treatment is important to separate the elements into two streams to optimize their recovery (working with smaller volumes and higher concentrations is technically and economically advantageous) and to remove elements that may decrease the efficiency of the recovery downstream. NF is a pressure-driven membrane technology that hinders the transport of multivalent species, while the monovalent ones can permeate [16]. Indeed, the application of NF for the treatment of SWDP brines has been studied previously. For instance, Ali [17] proposed the use of NF as desalination brine pre-treatment for a series of RO stages in a zero liquid discharge configuration. Rejections of 98 %, 91 %, 54 % and 46 % were obtained for Mg(II), Ca(II), Cl(− I) and Na(I), respectively. Du et al. [18] developed and modeled a process train for NaOH production from SWDP brine using NF as pre-treatment. It was estimated that for 10,000 kt/year of brine treated, about 35,000 t/year of NaOH could be produced, increasing in 50 % the water recovery and reducing by 29 % the brine disposal at the desalination plant. These studies highlighted the possi-bility of NF for separating monovalent from multivalent elements in the permeate and concentrate respectively, for a further recovery process. On the other hand, Ca(II) precipitation is commonly used as a pre- treatment in SWDP brine valorization schemes, even more so if mem-brane technologies are used downstream [19]. In fact, the precipitation of Ca(II) insoluble salts (e.g., gypsum (CaSO4⋅2H2O(s)) or calcite (CaCO3(s))) may result in scaling [20]. The formation of inorganic salts may reduce the flow rate through the pipes, drop the efficiency of heat exchangers, and decrease the productivity of membrane and thermal processes [21]. Wang et al. [22] used a modified sodium carbonate method to remove Ca(II) from brine coming from seawater multi-effect membrane distillation. It was concluded that the factor with the highest impact in Ca(II) removal efficiency was temperature. At optimum operating conditions (85 ◦C, an equimolar dosage of sodium carbonate and brine salinity higher than 56 g/kg) it was possible to reach an ef-ficiency of up to 85.4 % for Ca(II) removal, with a Mg(II) co- precipitation lower than 6.7 %. Chrisayu and Hanum [23] studied the extraction of Ca(II) from seawater in Indonesia (about 553 mg/L of Ca). After evaporating 50 % of the seawater and dosing 100 g/L oxalic acid, 99.99 % of the calcium precipitated. Therefore, under the appropriate circumstances, Ca(II) removal may be accomplished in order to avoid membrane scaling. The objective of this work is to describe the relevance of NF as a pretreatment stage in a global process dedicated to the valorization of RO SWDP brines by recovering minerals and metals and to study the techno economic aspects of the proposed multimineral brine mining pretreatment including precipitation of Ca(II) and NF. To our knowl-edge, it could be the first process capable of recovering so many minerals simultaneously from SWDP brine. Thus, the NF performance of new commercial membranes (PRO-XS2 from Hydranautics and FilmTec Fortilife XC-N from Dupont), developed to enhance the rejections of multivalent ions in high-salinity media, was experimentally evaluated and the results were compared to those obtained by the traditional FilmTec NF270 from Dupont. It is worth mentioning that there are no previous studies on the performance of PRO-XS2, while only a few ar-ticles cover Fortilife XC-N [24], but none of them studied its M. Figueira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Desalination 549 (2023) 1163213performance for brine treatment. A Ca(II) precipitation stage in the pre-treatment train has been considered from the economic point of view. Nevertheless, it is neces-sary to consider that Ca(II) precipitation usually requires an increase in energy and chemicals consumption. However, capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX, respectively) could be reduced if only the NF concentrate (about half the volume of original brine) feeds the Ca (II) precipitation stage. Thus, two scenarios were proposed: i) NF placed before the Ca(II) precipitation stage; and ii) to install the Ca(II) pre-cipitation stage before the NF to avoid the potential scaling issues in NF. In this work, a case study was proposed for the Fonsalía (Canary Island) desalination plant, one of Sea4Value partners, evaluating both scenarios from a technical and economic point of view in order to evaluate the optimal configuration for the brine pre-treatment, prior to the metal and mineral recovery train. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Case study: the seawater desalination plant in Fonsalía (Canary Islands) The desalination plant in Fonsalía (Canary Islands) uses RO tech-nology to produce 14,000 m3/day of potable water. As its conversion rate is 40 %, the brine production is 21,000 m3/day, which is currently discharged into the ocean at 225 m far from the coast [25]. This desa-lination plant could be considered a large scale SWDP since its pro-duction capacity is between 10,000 and 50,000 m3/d [26]. However, extra-large RO SWDPs around the world now achieve capacities such as 330,000 m3/d [27], reaching up to 600,000 m3/d [28]. It is expected that a larger SWDP will be able to establish this trace element recovery approach due to economics of scale. Since the high fluxes of brines generated could balance out the critical lower concentration and even-tually accomplish a feasible net production. The two scenarios proposed for the pre-treatment are illustrated in Fig. 1, considering a permeate recovery of 65 % for NF (the same determined experimentally). However, only the pre-treatment stage of Sea4Value process is depicted in Fig. 1 due to confidentiality reasons. The subsequent stages include: advanced membrane crystallization, multi-effect distillation, ion-selective polymer inclusion membranes, bipolar membranes electrodialysis, adsorption and different solvent extraction techniques [9]. In scenario 1, only the multivalent-rich stream (i.e. concentrate) feeds the Ca(II) precipitation unit, which could save costs during the Ca(II) removal but would also increase scaling problems in the NF membrane. Meanwhile, in scenario 2 all the brine feeds the Ca(II) removal unit. Since the Ca(II) precipitation is performed with excess of NaHCO3, scenario 2 needs a stage of acidifi-cation to avoid precipitation of carbonates, such as calcite and aragonite [29]. 2.2. Reagents For preparing the synthetic brine solutions that resemble the SWDP brines, anhydrous Na2SO4 (Glentham Life Sciences), NaHCO3, NaCl, H3BO3, Li2CO3, Rb2CO3, In2O3, NH4VO3 (PanReac), KCl, MgCl2⋅6H2O, Ga (NO3)3 (Alfa Aesar), Sc2O3, Na2CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and (NH4)6Mo7O24 (MERCK) were employed. All reagents were analytical grade. Besides that, HNO3 69 % from PanReac was used to condition sam-ples for ICP and HCl 37 %, from the same supplier, was employed to Scenario 121000 m3/day21000 m3/day7350 m3/dayMulvalent rich streamMonovalent rich stream13650 m3/day7350 m3/daySWDP brineScenario 221000 m3/day7350 m3/dayMulvalent rich streamMonovalent rich stream13650 m3/daySWDP brineAcidificaonNanofiltraonCa (II) precipitaonNanofiltraonCa (II) precipitaonFig. 1.

Desalination 549 (2023) 1163214adjust pH of the synthetic brine. 2.3. NF set-up A flat-sheet experimental set-up was used to assess the performance of the three commercial thin-film composite NF membranes (PRO-XS2 from Hydranautics, FilmTec Fortilife XC-N and FilmTec NF270 from Dupont) for brine valorisation. Firstly, 8 L of synthetic brine solution were placed in the feed tank and isothermally maintained with a refrigerator at 25 ± 5 ◦C throughout the entire experiment. Further-more, the high-pressure diaphragm pump (Hydracell, USA) variation frequency was set to 36 Hz. The feed solution was propelled inside a flat- sheet membrane module (GE SEPA™ CF-II) with an active membrane area of 0.014 m2 and polypropylene spacers of 36 mil. Two pressure gauges were allocated at the feed and concentrate streams to monitor transmembrane pressure (TMP). Besides, TMP and flow were adjusted through a by-pass and needle valves. A flowmeter (Bürkert FLOW) measured the concentrate flow. Finally, a cartridge filter (10 μm) was placed in the concentrate stream to avoid corrosion particles from entering the pump. 2.4. Experimental methodology The composition of the synthetic brine prepared was established after analysis of real brine samples coming from Fonsalía desalination plant (results of analysis presented in Table 1). Table 1 also lists the composition of the synthetic brines used in the experiments and com-pares it with SWDP brines from literature. The first brine (brine 1, pH 7.5) feeds the NF stage treating directly the brine coming from the SWDP (scenario 1). The second brine (brine 2) feeds the Ca(II) selective pre-cipitation stage before the NF unit (scenario 2) thus, the original brine composition was modified accordingly. Molinari et al. [20] tested Na3C6H5O7, Na2CO3 and NaHCO3 as calcium precipitation reagents for SWDP brine and reported better results for NaHCO3 (reduced magne-sium loss in the precipitated CaCO3(s)). Hence, NaHCO3 was selected in this study as precipitation reagent. The following assumptions were made to determine the composition of brine 2: NaHCO3 was used in excess (10 %) to precipitate calcium, resulting on Ca(II) removal of 90 % and 10 % of Mg(II) removal [20]. Since the precipitation was performed with excess of NaHCO3 there would be a concern related to the pre-cipitation of carbonates that could also result in membrane scaling. Therefore, pH adjustment would be necessary to avoid precipitation of CaCO3(s) [29]. A simulation was performed with PHREEQC software for brine 2 composition, at pH 6.5 (presented in Fig. A.1 — Supplementary Information) and it was determined that there would be a risk of gypsum precipitation (CaSO4⋅2H2O(s)), but there would not be precipitation of aragonite and calcite (polymorphs of CaCO3(s)) for % permeate recovery below 80 %. Therefore, the pH was set to 6.5 in brine 2 to avoid car-bonates precipitation. Due to the low concentration of Li(I), In(III), Rb (I), V(V), Ga(III), Sc(III) and Mo(VI) in the SWDP brines (μg/L levels), it was decided to spike their concentrations to 0.5 mg/L to make them measurable by the analytical techniques in order to determine clearly the rejection trends. Initially, simulations carried out with the WAVE software from Dupont [34] with the membrane NF270 determined that to achieve a permeate recovery of 65 %, the feed pressure had to be set at 30 bar (results from the simulation are included in Table B.1 — Supplementary Information). Therefore, a pressurization stage at 32 bar and 5 L/min (crossflow velocity of 1 m/s) was performed before each experiment. Initially, distilled water was used followed by pressurization with the brine in a closed-circuit configuration (recirculation of permeate and concentrate). Then, the experiments were performed in open-circuit, hence the concentrate obtained from the NF module was recycled into the feed tank, while the permeate was extracted out of the system. In this way, it was possible to simulate several NF modules in series. Experi-ments were performed at constant TMP (30 bar) and feed flow (3.5 L/ min, crossflow velocity of 0.7 m/s) until 65 % permeate recovery was achieved. Concentrate and permeate samples were collected at the beginning of the experiment and after recovering 0.25 L of permeate. Conductivity, pH and temperature were monitored in all samples. 2.5. Analytical methodologies Samples were analyzed by ionic chromatography (DIONEX AQUION) with the aim of determining Cl− and SO42− concentrations. Precisely, a DIONEX-ADRS 600 column and 25 mM KOH as mobile phase were used. Moreover, carbonate concentration was determined by automatic titration (Mettler Toledo T70 — Rondolino) using 1 mM HCl solution as titrant. Finally, concentrations of the other elements in so-lution were determined by spectrometry (7800 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and 5100 inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) from Agilent Technol-ogies). Conductivity and pH of samples were determined on-site via a pH-meter (CRISON GLP-22) and a conductimeter (CRISON GLP-31). 2.6. Experimental data analysis For the calculation of rejections (R(%)), Eq. 1 was employed using the permeate (c′) and feed concentrations (cf). R(%) =[1 −c′cf]⋅100 (1) Likewise, concentration factors (CF) and permeate recoveries (% p. r.) were calculated through Eqs. 2 and 3, respectively, where c′ ′ is the Table 1 Brines composition (mg/L) simulating the composition for the two proposed scenarios and comparison among different brines composition found in literature.

A plunging in rejections is expected as more permeate is recovered due to a progressive concentration of the feed (only the concentrate was recirculated to the feed tank), which can be related to: i) a decrease in the permeate flux at higher % p.r. due to the increase in the osmotic pressure of the feed solution, and ii) a higher concentration gradient across the membrane, resulting both in a decrease in rejections [35]. CF =c′ ′cf(2)  %p.r. =[V ′Vf]⋅100 (3) To obtain the permeate flux (Jv, LMH), Eq. 4 was used in which A (m2) and t (h) stand for membrane area and sample-collecting time respectively. Jv =V ′A⋅t(4) In addition, average selectivity factors (SF) along p.r. between monovalent species and multivalent species on every membrane were calculated using Eq. 5, where Rmon and Rmulti are the average rejection along p.r. of the average monovalent group and multivalent group, respectively. SF =100 − Rmon100 − Rmulti(5)  2.7. Economic evaluation assumptions The two scenarios proposed in Fig. 1 were considered for the esti-mation of CAPEX of the brine pre-treatment. The Fonsalía desalination plant produces about 21,000 m3/day of brine. Adel et al. [36] reported that the permeate flow in a RO desalination plant can decrease by 25 % between two cleaning-in-place (CIP) procedures. As 21,000 m3/day was considered an average value, it was assumed that the production of the desalination plant could range between 24,000 and 18,000 m3/day approximately. The permeate production in the NF for 65 % p.r. (maximum value obtained experimentally) was estimated to be 13,650 ± 2,000 m3/day or 569 ± 83 m3/h for both scenarios. Ning [37] reported that a complete NF system that produces 226 m3/ h of permeate (with a p.r. of 65 %, using 29 pressure vessels with 6 membrane elements in each vessel, at 25 bar) had a CAPEX of 1.2 million 2015EUR including direct and indirect costs, but excluding the cost of pressure vessels and membrane elements. This cost was updated to 2021 (1.3 million 2021EUR) based on the inflation rate for the period of time. Eq. 6 was used to calculate the inflation rate in Spain for the period. Inflation Rate (%) =CPIfinal year − CPIinitial yearCPIinitial year× 100 (6)  where CPI is the consumer price index. The annual average (CPI 2021 =100 since it was the base year and CPI 2015 = 93.4) of general CPI calculated by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics was used [38]. Then, a cost correlation was used (Eq. 7) to determine the NF CAPEX (excluding pressure vessels and membrane elements) based on the reference value, where n is the correlation parameter that depends on the equipment considered. The smaller the value of n, the more ad-vantageous is the scale-up [39]. A typical value of n for RO/NF systems is 0.85 [39], Costcase study = Costreference(Sizecase studySizereference)n(7) For the calculation of number of membrane elements (membranes) needed in this case study, Eq. 8 was used, where Qp (L/h) is the total permeate flow rate, Jv (LMH) is the average volumetric flux obtained experimentally for each membrane and Ae (m2) is the active membrane area of one element. The active membrane area of one element was considered 37 m2 for NF270-400/34i [40] and for PRO-XS2 [41], and 34 m2 for Fortilife XC-N [42]. number of elements =QpJvAe(8) For the Ca(II) precipitation stage, the work of Molinari et al. [20] was considered. The synthetic brine used by the authors had the same con-centration of major elements as the brine 1 used in this work (corre-sponding to scenario 1). It was concluded that the optimal conditions to obtain the maximum Ca(II) removal were obtained using NaHCO3 with a molar ratio HCO3− /Ca(II) = 3 and temperature of 60 ◦C. The CAPEX for the Ca(II) precipitation was calculated according to Chen et al. [43], who considered indirect costs as 10 % of direct costs. The flow rate feeding this stage (about 21,000 m3/day for scenario 2 and 7,350 m3/ day for scenario 1) was considered in Eq. 7 to calculate the CAPEX using n = 0.49, typical of precipitation systems [39]. On the other hand, membrane scaling could significantly reduce productivity and permeate quality, increasing the frequency of mem-brane cleaning and reducing membrane lifespan [44]. The reduction of membrane lifetime could increase the OPEX of the project. It is expected that with scenario 2 (see Fig. 1), the previous removal of Ca(II) would decrease membrane scaling and increase NF membrane lifetime. The replacement of membranes is typically 5 to 10 years [45]. Since Ca(II) precipitation is the main issue regarding membrane scaling in this case, it was assumed that for scenario 1 the lifetime of membranes was 5 years while for scenario 2 it was 8 years. An in-line acidification system in scenario 2 was proposed to reduce the brine pH to 6.5, before the NF technology. This proposed system should not induce significant changes in CAPEX, but the consumption of HCl is significant for OPEX estimation. The consumption of HCl was based on the NF experiments where about 45 mL of HCl 37 % (pure) were required to decrease the pH of 30 L of the synthetic brine 2 to 6.5 (Section 2.4). With a simple direct correlation between volumes and considering the density of the solution as 1.19 kg/L, the mass of HCl 37 % solution necessary to adjust the pH of 21,000 ± 3,000 m3/day of brine was estimated (37,485 ± 5,000 ton/day). Still related to OPEX, the maintenance cost was supposed to be 3 % of CAPEX [46]. For the labor cost, it was presumed that 2 supervisors and 6 operators were necessary. Eq. 9 was used to calculate the capital charge factor [47], where r is the interest rate and m is the plant lifetime. An interest rate of 5.5 % was assumed for a conservative approach since 5.5 % was the highest value in the past 20 years in Spain (currently the interest rate is 3 %) [48]. The total cost including CAPEX and OPEX was levelized using the capital charge factor and normalized by the inlet flow of SWDP brine [49]. capital charge factor =r(1 + r)m(1 + r)m − 1(9) Finally, the specific energy consumption (SEC) is the amount of en-ergy needed to produce a unit volume of permeate, expressed in kWh/ m3 [50]. For the calculation of SEC, Eq. 10 was used [51]: SEC =Qf TMP36Qpη(10)  where Qf (L/h) is the feed flow rate and η is the efficiency of the pump, which was assumed to be 0.80. Table 2 summarizes the main assumption used at the economic evaluation. M.

Desalination 549 (2023) 11632163. Results and discussion 3.1. Technical NF results considering the NF step prior to Ca(II) precipitation (scenario 1) 3.1.1. Major elements The rejection values obtained with the NF set-up for the elements in major and minor concentration in brine 1 (no calcium removal pre- treatment before NF) are depicted in Fig. 2. It was targeted to achieve with the new membranes (Fortilife XC-N and PRO-XS2) rejections higher for multivalent and lower for monovalent elements than the re-jections reported in literature for NF270 (Ca(II) = 50 %, Mg(II) = 71 %, NaCl = 12 %, K(I) = 5 % and S(VI) = 91 % [57]). As a result, NF270 membrane fed with brine 1 showed markedly differences in major divalent elements (Fig. 2a). Indeed, S(VI) was the most rejected element (85 %), followed by Mg(II) and Ca(II), being rejected 75 % and 60 %, respectively. It is worth mentioning that S(VI) was present in the solution as SO42− , then it was the most rejected ion due to Donnan exclusion, one of the governing hindered mechanisms in NF. Precisely, polyamide Thin-Film Composite (TFC) NF membranes surface arises an electric field depending on pH due to the protonation/depro-tonation of the amino and carboxylic free radicals in the active layer. Above isoelectric point (IEP), membranes acquire negative charge. For example, the IEP of the membrane NF270 is in the range of pH from 3.00 to 4.05 for 1 to 50 NaCl mol/m3 [58]. Thus, counter-ions might permeate easier than co-ions due to charge attraction/repulsion. Then, Donnan exclusion explains the fact that cations such as Ca2+ and Mg2+were less rejected than anions (e.g., SO42− ), for pH above IEP [59]. Regarding the monovalent elements (Na(I), Cl(− I), K(I), IC), their rejections were around to 20 %, 30 %, 35 % and 47 %, respectively for NF270. These rejections, in contrast to divalent species could be explained by the second governing exclusion mechanism: dielectric exclusion [60]. Due to the difference of dielectric constants between solution and the polymeric matrix, the ions in solution must lose the hydration shell, which is proportional to the square of the absolute charge of the ions [61]. Therefore, it was expected that multi-charged species were more repelled than mono-charged/non-charged ones. Furthermore, a declining trend in rejections, as more permeate re-covery (p.r.) was obtained, was another key aspect shared barely among some major elements. In fact, as it can be seen in Fig. 2a rejections for Mg(II), IC, K(I) and Cl(− I) lowered from 78 %, 51 %, 34 % and 30 % at 0 % p.r. to 68 %, 43 %, 24 % and 21 % at a 66 % p.r., respectively. Un-likely, the rest of species maintained a constant tendency along the p.r. and even though some declining trend was observed, it was not steeper enough to assure a diminish in rejections. Overall, divalent elements (Mg(II)) shrinkage in rejections only achieved a 12 % drop while monovalent (K(I) and Cl(− I)) lowered their rejections in 30 % at maximum levels of % p.r.. The explanation that covers exclusion mechanisms justifies various shrinking trends in rejections between monovalent and multivalent. As mentioned, more permeate recovered means a more concentrated feed because only the concentrate stream was recirculated back to the feed tank. As a result, a greater concen-tration gradient raised and due to Fick's law of diffusion, species permeated trough the membrane easily and rejections gradually decreased. Nevertheless, dielectric exclusion influence is more severe in multivalent species rejections than in monovalent. Thus, even with a steeper concentration gradient that lowers rejections, multivalent re-jections dropped at a smoother slope than monovalent ones. Regarding Fortilife XC-N performance in major elements rejections (Fig. 2c), the following average values were obtained for Ca(II), Mg(II) and S(VI): 78 %, 83 % and 77 %, respectively. In contrast to the high rejection for divalent element, monovalent ones had their rejections distributed between 30 % for K(I) to 13 % for both Cl(− I) and Na(I). On the other hand, IC showed mild-high rejections (50 % on average). The wide gap in rejections that was laid between divalent and monovalent elements strengthen the hypothesis that dielectric exclusion had greater influence than Donnan exclusion when evaluating the rejection of spe-cies by NF membranes. In addition, again most of the species exhibited a notably diminishing trend in rejections as % p.r. increased. Rejections of Ca(II), Mg(II) and S(VI) (divalent species), that were 83 %, 88 % and 81 % at 0–10 % p.r. decreased to 69 %, 75 % and 75 % at maximum permeate recovery achieved (65 %), respectively. Meanwhile, mono-valent species (IC, K(I), Na(I), Cl(− I)) showed a drop in rejections from 57 %, 30 %, 28 % and 21 % to 49 %, 22 %, 15 % and 13 %, respectively. Furthermore, the relative falls (%) in rejections per element uncovered the fact that monovalent (14 %, 26 %, 46 % and 38 %) suffered more serious declines that divalent elements (16 %, 14 % and 7 %). Concerning major elements rejection when using PRO-XS2 (Fig. 2e), divalent species such as Ca(II), Mg(II) and S(VI) showed average re-jections around 70 %, 86 % and 90 %, respectively. Among the divalent group, it could be observed that Ca(II) achieved rejections values below the ones for Mg(II) and S(VI) for all the p.r. studied range. Precisely, it was stated a 20 % rejection gap among them. Moreover, since S(VI) dominant species was SO42− at experimental pH conditions, its high rejection was easily explained as a resultant combination of Donnan and dielectric exclusions. In contrast, monovalent elements reached considerably low rejection values between 33 % and 20 %. Average rejections obtained for K(I), Na(I) and Cl(− I) were 23 %, 27 % and 31 %, respectively, although IC showed higher rejections (64 % on average). Consequently, due to dielectric exclusion, monovalent and divalent el-ements (excluding IC) were separated by a rejection gap of about 30 %. Regarding the expected decline in rejections as more permeate was extracted, a slight general downward trend could be perceived. In exception of Mg(II) and Ca(II) of which rejections shrunk from 89 % and 73 % to 83 % and 65 % at a 67 % p.r., respectively. 3.1.2. Minor species Referring to NF270 performance on rejecting minor species (Fig. 2b), multivalent species (i.e. Sc(III), In(III), Ga(III), Mo(VI) and V(V)) were highly rejected (80–100 %). As showed in Table 2, it is worth mentioning that Sc(III) and In(III) rejections will be explained in the multivalent group even though both elements are present as a non- charged species. The explanation lays in a strong size exclusion due to a coordination of hydroxyl ions and water with the central ion. For instance, it could be observed experimentally that In(OH)3 adopted an octahedral structure in coordination with 3 water molecules and 3 hy-droxy ions ([In(H2O)3(OH)3]0) [62]. In addition, due to dielectric exclusion as the most influent exclusion mechanism, multivalent ele-ments showed higher rejections in comparison to monovalent (i.e. Rb(I) and Li(I)) and non-charged species (such as B(III) in the form of boric Table 2 Main assumption used for the economic evaluation (€ = 2021EUR).

Figueira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Desalination 549 (2023) 1163217acid at pH below 9.24, i.e. H3BO3(aq) [63]), that exhibited rejections at least 45 % lower than the multivalent ones. Moreover, Rb(I), Li(I) and B (III) were found within the low-rejected elements achieving average rejections of 30 %, 16 % and 3 %, respectively. B(III) showed the lowest rejection because the electromigration exclusion mechanisms did not influence it as a non-charged specie. About the fall on rejections due to an increment in feed concentration, a slight trend was observed in multivalent elements. Nevertheless, a gradual drop on Rb(I) and Li(I) was exhibited from 31 % and 17 % to 23 % and 10 %, respectively at 67 % p.r. The relative decrease in rejections was around 25 % and 41 % of initial rejection values. In experiments with the Fortilife XC-N membrane (Fig. 2d), multi-valent elements registered elevated rejections that were sustained along the % p.r. and comprised rejections between 90 and 70 %. However, V (V) showed lower rejection (64 %) than the rest of multivalent. In fact, V (V) in solution at the experimental pH was expected to be a mixture of VO2(OH)2− and VO3OH2− , as indicated by the speciation diagram of V(V) done with the Hydra/Medusa software [30] presented in Supplementary Information, Fig. C.1. As a result of its presence as a monovalent species, rejections were expected somewhat lower than multivalent ones. Un-likely to multivalent ions, a compact rejection range was not reached by monovalent elements since Rb(I) was rejected around 30 %, while Li(I) and B(I) were 5 % and − 5 %, respectively. Besides, Sc(III), In(III), Mo (VI), Ga(III), V(V), Rb(I) and Li(I) exhibited a shrinkage in rejections as more permeate was recovered dropping from 90 %,90 %, 86 %, 89 %, 67 %, 35 % and 11 % at 3 % p.r. to 79 %, 81 %, 72 %, 71 %, 60 %, 26 % and − 3 % at 62 % p.r., respectively. Nevertheless, this trend could not be observed for B(III) as its rejections were on average close to 0 %. In other words, relative fall on rejections for Sc(III), In(III), Mo(VI), Ga(III), V(V), Rb(I) and Li(I) were the following: 12 %, 10 %, 16 %, 20 %, 10 %, 25 % and 125 %. As a result, it could be inferred that monovalent elements tended to suffer more serious declines in rejections. On the results of the PRO-XS2 membrane (Fig. 2f), multivalent were highly rejected and even V(V) rejections were above 80 %. Additionally, Sn(III), In(III), Mo(VI), Ga(III) rejections were all comprised above 95 % and in some occasions, extremely close to 100 %. As a result, such high rejections created a remarkable wide gap in rejections between mono-valent and multivalent. In monovalent group, Rb(I) rejections were around 25 % while Li(I) and B(III) were approximately 10 % and − 2 %, respectively. In addition, no remarkable falls were observed on re-jections as %p.r. was increased, except for Li(I), whose rejections low-ered from 15 % to 5 % at the maximum % p.r. achieved (62 %). 3.2. Technical NF results considering the NF step after Ca(II) precipitation (scenario 2) 3.2.1. Major elements The rejection values obtained with the NF set-up for the elements in major and minor concentration in brine 2 (calcium removal pre- treatment before NF) are shown in Fig. 3. Concerning NF270 results with brine 2, multivalent elements such as Ca(II), Mg(II) and S(VI) showed rejections close to 60 %, 70 % and 83 %. As it can be seen in Fig. 3a, multivalent elements did not form a narrow rejection range and between each three elements laid a significant 10 % gap. Once again, S(VI) was the most rejected element because of an intense influence of electric exclusion mechanisms on its main specie (SO42− ). Along the same scenarios, a compact rejection group within monovalent elements could not be achieved since Cl(− I) and IC re-jections remained slightly higher (50–55 %). Meanwhile, Na(I) and K(I) rejections were low (~20 %) as expected due to their single positive charge. Moreover, a dropping tendency on rejections as more permeate was recovered was observed for Mg(II), S(VI) and Cl(− I). Concretely, their rejections shrunk from 80 %, 91 % and 54 % to 67 %, 79 % and 37 % at maximum p.r. (67 %). Among these three elements, the multivalent (Mg(II) and S(VI)) showed less pronounced declining (13–16 %) than the monovalent (31 % rejection for Cl(− I)).

M. Figueira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Desalination 549 (2023) 1163218With regard to Fortilife XC-N (Fig. 3c), Ca(II), Mg(II) and S(VI) showed close rejections comprised in a gap ranging from 75 to 90 %. On average, 77 %, 81 % and 85 %, respective rejections were achieved. Furthermore, S(VI) was the most rejected specie as expected due to the exclusion mechanism mentioned before. Also, IC was the most rejected monovalent element with a rejection of 50 %, still bellow multivalent elements rejections. Nevertheless, the rest of monovalent (K(I), Cl(− I) and Na(I)) rejections were even lower and more compact (35–15 %). Precisely, their average rejections were 22 %, 25 % and 15 %. In this scenario, a declining trend on rejections could mainly be observed in monovalent elements. In that way, K(I), Cl(− I) and Na(I) decreased from 23 %, 32 % and 21 % to 15 %, 22 % and 10 % at 67 % p.r. Moreover, relative shrunk on rejections were the following: 34 %, 31 % and 52 % for K(I), Cl(− I) and Na(I). Unlike, divalent rejections seemed to barely drop. About PRO-XS2 (Fig. 3e), divalent Mg(II) and S(VI) were rejected on average approximately (83 %) and showed rejected profiles remarkably similar. In contrast, Ca(II) was rejected substantially less (68 %) than both divalent Mg(II) and S(VI). On the bottom of rejections, monovalent ones comprised a compact group of rejected species (between 32 % and 3 %) with average rejections for K(I), Na(I) and Cl(− I) of 21 %, 14 % and 23 %, respectively. Nevertheless, IC showed higher rejections (>60 %). 3.2.2. Minor species In the experiment using the NF270 membrane (Fig. 3b), Sc(III), In (III), Mo(VI) and Ga(III) showed rejections particularly high (~90 %) conforming a high-rejected compact group. However, V(V) was not so highly rejected (70 %) due to its speciation as an equimolar mixture of VO2(OH)2− and VO3OH2− . Contrary to high-rejected elements, mono-valent ones comprised a group of low rejected elements located below a 45 % rejection gap from V(V). As a result, monovalent elements were remarkably separated in rejections in comparison to multivalent ones. Furthermore, Rb(I), Li(I) and B(III) had average rejections of 22 %, 9 % and − 4 %. B(III) showed fundamentally negative rejections. Since B(III) is neutral-charged due to its speciation (see Fig. C.2 — Supplementary information), it is not repelled by electric fields generated by the membrane. And as the permeate volumetric flux is way lower than the feed volumetric flow, depending on molecules electromigration it could happen that a greater permeate concentration is achieved in comparison with the feed concentration of boron [64]. Additionally, an undeniable shrunk on rejections appeared for all species regardless B(III). Sc(III), In (III), Mo(VI), Ga(III) and V(V) fell from 95 %, 97 %, 91 %, 91 % and 79 % to 87 %, 83 %, 79 %, 79 % and 66 % at a 67 % p.r.. In contrast, monovalent Rb(I) and Li(I) had a drop from 26 % and 10 % to 19 % and 2 %, respectively. Moreover, it could be observed that multivalent ele-ments (Sc(III), In(III), Mo(VI), Ga(III) and V(V)) had an 8 %, 14 %, 13 % and 16 % relative decreasing on rejections from their initial value. Meanwhile, monovalent (Rb(I) and Li(I)) showed deeper falls (27 % and 80 %, respectively). Fortilife XC-N (Fig. 3d) caused noticeably high rejections on Sc(III), In(III), Ga(III) and Mo(VI), that showed average rejections of 85 %, 85 %, 80 % and 82 %, respectively. However, V(V) rejections were way lower than multivalent ones (50 %). Regarding monovalent elements, a wide gap in rejection appeared between Rb(I) (20 %), Li(I) (− 7 %) and B (III) (− 15 %). Moreover, remarkable decreasing trends were observed in Rb(I), as it rejections shrunk from 30 % to 17 % at a 67 % p.r. Furthermore, a subtle decreasing tendency in V(V) appeared lowering its rejections from 61 % to 51 %. Assessing PRO-XS2 performance in multivalent elements (Fig. 3f) showed overlapped rejections from Sc(III), In(III) and Mo(VI) (around 90 %). In addition, V(V) rejections were scattered around 65 and 80 %. And Ga(III) showed its rejections comprised between 58 and 78 %. About monovalent elements, all presented low rejections since Rb(I), Li (I) and B(III) were rejected on average 21 %, 2 % and 10 %, respectively. In fact, both Li(I) and B(III) acquired negative rejections after a 30 % p. r., reaching rejection values slightly below − 20 % at the highest % p.r. (62 %).

M. Figueira et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Desalination 549 (2023) 11632193.3. Comparison among the membranes and scenarios tested Overall, the new commercial membranes PRO-XS2 and Fortilife XC- N presented a higher rejection of Ca(II) and Mg(II) than the traditional commercial membrane NF270. For example, while NF270 presented Ca (II) rejections below 60 % at 65 % p.r. for both scenarios, PRO-XS2 reached 65 % Ca(II) rejection and the values for Fortilife XC-N were even higher than 70 %. Regarding Mg(II), the rejections at 65 % p.r. were about 70 % for NF270 in both scenarios, 75 % and 83 % for For-tilife XC-N and 85 % and 78 % for PRO-XS2 in scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Considering major elements in scenario 1, PRO-XS2 was the membrane whose rejections varied the least with the increase in %p. r., while in scenario 2 the performance of Fortilife XC-N was more constant independently on % p.r. Regarding the minor elements, Fortilife XC-N and NF270 presented similar behavior for scenarios 1 and 2 while the rejection profile of PRO- XS2 changed considerable. In scenario 1 the rejection of Sc(III), In(III), Mo(VI) and Ga(III) given by PRO-XS2 was always above 95 %. Never-theless, in scenario 2 the rejections of Sc(III), In(III) and Mo(VI) reached 85 % and Ga(III) 78 % at 65 % p.r. The value of 85 % was higher than that obtained with other membranes, however in the case of Ga(III), PRO-XS2 presented lower rejections than the other membranes. Overall, PRO-XS2 was the best membrane for separation of minor monovalent and multivalent elements in scenario 1 but in scenario 2 NF270 had a better performance. The obtained results were compared with those previously published in the literature. It must be highlighted that in most of the cases, the studies published referring to the treatment of seawater or SWDP brines do not focus on the behavior of minor elements. Liu et al. [65] performed similar experiments regarding the influence of permeate recovery on seawater brine elements rejections using NF. A DL2540 (GE Co. Ltd.) spiral wound membrane was used to assess the rejections behavior considering the following feed composition in mg/L: Na(I): 20,520; Ca (II): 630; Cl(− I): 36,900; K(I): 830; S(VI): 5,200; Mg(II): 2,480; IC: 240. Initially, rejections (%) at 12 bar were as follows: 0, 60, 10, 8, 100, 92 and 30 for Na(I), Ca(II), Cl(− I), K(I), S(VI), Mg(II) and IC, respectively. However, at maximum p.r. obtained (54.3 %) at 12 bar and 7.33 L/min inlet flowrate, rejections decreased noticeably for Mg(II) and Ca(II) to 37.8 % and 87.8 % respectively, while the same dropping trend was observed for Cl(− I), K(I) and Na(I), whose rejections reached a bottom at 5 %. In addition, a double-stage NF and electrochemical disinfection was proposed by El-Ghzizel et al. [66] to produce drinking water from local underground water (Kenitra, Morocco) using NF90 spiral-wound membranes (DuPont). Concerning the double-stage NF process, the following rejections (%) were reported at 75 % p.r. at 5 bar and 7.66 L/ min inlet flowrate: K(I): 78.6 %, Na(I): 84.4 %, Mg(I): 96.3 %, Ca(I): 92.9 %, IC: 92.3 %, Cl(− I): 96 % and S(VI): 96.5 %. Nativ et al. [67] studied a hybrid 6NF monovalent selective and RO process with the aim of desalinating brackish water using the following composition (in mg/ L): Ca(II): 188; Mg(II): 166; Na(I): 1,118; and Cl(− I): 2,269. Their ex-periments were performed at 6 bar in a pilot-scale plant formed by 1 module of 4 GE DL-4040-F1021 Stinger membranes. Under the tested conditions, it was possible to recover 70 % of water as permeate, obtaining overall rejections of 52.6 %, 69.9 %, 10.4 % and 14.4 for Ca (II), Mg(II), Na(I) and Cl(− I), respectively. Scarce studies were found focused on analyzing NF rejections of all the minor elements considered in this work when treating SWDP brine. For instance, Somrani et al. [68] studied the separation of Li from salt lake (Chott Djeri, Tunisia) brines using NF. Using the 10-fold diluted brine (340 mg/L of Mg(II) and 6 mg/L of Li(I)), the polyamide TFC membrane NF90 by Filmtec (Dupont) was used to separate Li(I) from Mg (II). The values of rejection reported were 100 % for Mg(II) and 30 % for Li(I) operating at 25 bar. Werner et al. [69] studied the influence of pH for the separation of In(III) and Ge(IV) using the polyamide TFC mem-brane NF99HF (Alfa Laval). Authors reported an In(III) rejection of 100 % for single salt solutions of 10 mg/L of In2(SO4)3 at pH values higher than 6. The results of In(III) rejection in this work were slightly lower, showing that the presence of other elements in brine may interfere in the rejections. In fact, ionic strength has a direct influence on pKa of species [70]. For that reason, speciation distribution of elements may vary because of the displacement of equilibrium pKa and hence, its rejections. 3.3.1. Multivalent and monovalent concentration and selectivity factors Concentration factors of the different elements in solution were calculated (see Figs. D.1 (major elements) and D.2 (minor elements) — Supplementary Information). At 65 % p.r. only the membrane PRO-XS2 had concentration factors higher than 2 for Mg(II) in both scenarios. The PRO-XS2 also presented concentration factors higher than 2 for S(VI) in both scenarios and for Ca(II) in scenario 1 (it was about 1.9 in scenario 2). Moreover, in order to identify which membrane would provide the best selectivity in the two scenarios evaluated, selectivity factors be-tween monovalent and multivalent elements were calculated (see Table 3). A higher selectivity among major (SF = 4.3) and minor (SF =38.4) elements was achieved by PRO-XS2 operating in scenario 1. Meanwhile in scenario 2, Fortilife XC-N reached the highest selectivity among the three membranes for major elements (SF = 4.7) and NF270 reported a better selectivity referred to minor elements (SF = 9.5). The values of permeate flux at initial conditions and at 65 % p.r. for the three tested membranes for both scenarios are also summarized in Table 3. The increment in permeate recovery resulted in a drop of permeate flux due to the increase of osmotic pressure in the feed side. In scenario 1, the average reduction in permeate flux was about 8 % while in brine 2 it was about 22 %. For both brines, the membrane that pre-sented the smallest reduction was the Fortilife XC-N. Scenario 1 was expected to have a greater decrease in permeate flow due to scaling problems caused by gypsum and calcite, however a longer period of time would be needed to observe influence of scaling in reduction of permeate flow [71] since all the experiments were completed in <12 h. Considering scenario 2, Fortilife XC-N had the highest permeate flux, the highest Ca(II) and Mg(II) rejections at 65 % p.r (about 75 % and 83 %, respectively) and major elements selectivity. However, it presented the lowest minor elements selectivity when compared to the other two membranes. It is worth mentioning that Sea4Value is interested on recovering not only minor elements but also Mg(II) and Ca(II). For scenario 1, NF270 presented the highest permeate flux but the lowest rejection of Ca(II) and Mg(II) and selectivity of major species, while PRO-XS2 presented the highest selectivity between monovalent and multivalent elements for major and minor elements but the lowest permeate flux. The economic analysis can elucidate if the difference in permeate flux between the membranes significantly affects the cost expenditures of the pre-treatment.

Desalination 549 (2023) 116321103.4. Techno-economic assessment of brine pre-treatment in the Fonsalía desalination plant The results obtained experimentally were used in the economic analysis. Hence, Table 4 collects the results of CAPEX and OPEX for each scenario and each membrane. The permeate fluxes obtained for each tested membrane (for scenario 1 and scenario 2) were used for the calculation of the number of membranes needed in each scenario. The number of membrane elements was calculated using Eq. 8 for each permeate flux reported in Table 3 (considering 65 % p.r.) and it was oversized by a 10 % as a margin of error. Besides that, it was considered that each pressure vessel contained 6 membrane elements, hence, the number of elements was adjusted to be a multiple of 6. The number of membranes needed and the total CAPEX for NF are listed in Table 4. As the consumption of NaHCO3 depends on the concentration of Ca (II) on the stream feeding the precipitation tank, for scenario 1 it was necessary to consider the Ca(II) concentration at the concentrate stream after the NF set-up for the 3 different membranes at 65 % p.r. (Section 3.1). The cost of NaHCO3 related to remove Ca(II) is reported in Table 4. The SEC of NF was calculated using Eq. 10 and resulted in 1.6 kWh/ m3. The value obtained was the same for scenarios 1 and 2 since the total permeate and feed flowrate were the same in both cases. The SEC ob-tained was slightly lower than the values reported in the literature for large-scale RO and NF systems, whose SEC normally varies between 2 and 4 kWh/m3 [72]. Besides, the simulation performed with WAVE software (see Table B.1 in Supplementary Information) resulted in SEC of 1.6 and 1.7 kWh/m3 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively, values very close to the one obtained experimentally. With the SEC value and the permeate production of 13,650 m3/day (Fig. 1), it was possible to calculate the NF energy consumption related to pumping requirements, as shown in Table 4 (OPEX). The cost of energy in Spain for business was considered to be 0.103 €/kWh [73]. As can be seen in Table 4, scenario 1 presented lower values of CAPEX since the size of the precipitation vessel is smaller than in sce-nario 2. Regarding OPEX, Table 4 presents the main expenditures excluding energy consumption of Ca(II) precipitation. The variation between scenarios is significant since the OPEX for scenario 2 is at least 40 % higher than for scenario 1. This occurred since the difference in cost of membrane replacement was not so significant as expected and the cost of chemicals represented the largest expenses. The cost of HCl consumption (only in Scenario 2) was the second highest operational expenditure excluding the energy consumption of Ca(II) precipitation. The cost of the added NaHCO3 was the highest expenditure representing at least 80 % of the total OPEX and it was also higher for scenario 2. Therefore, the total levelized cost TLC that considers both OPEX and CAPEX was higher for scenario 2. One of the critical parameters on Ca(II) removal as calcium car-bonate is the temperature. Fig. 4a presents the influence of the tem-perature of Ca(II) precipitation in the TLC calculated for this case study and Fig. 4b presents an estimation of the variation of Ca(II) removal percentage with temperature based on Molinari et al. [20] work. The TLC at 25 ◦C is the one presented at Table 4 while for the other tem-peratures, the cost of heating the brine for Ca(II) precipitation (calcu-lated using Aspen Hysys [74])was added. The difference in TLC between the membranes was too small to be noticed in the graph (standard deviation between the membranes was 0.09 and 0.11 €/m3 for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively). Hence, Fig. 4a shows only the average value of TLC for the three membranes in each scenario. PRO-XS2 presented the highest TLC in both scenarios while NF270 presented the lowest TLC in both scenarios, but Fortilife XC-N presented the same TLC of NF270 in scenario 2. Besides, Fig. 4b shows that it is possible to reach 90 % Ca(II) removal heating the brine up to 70 ◦C, but in Fig. 4a it is reported that this increase in temperature significantly impacts the TLC of the project. As can be seen in Fig. 4a, the temperature of Ca(II) precipitation has a greater impact on scenario 2 since the flow rate of brine feeding the precipitation stage would be higher. However, in both scenarios the cost of heating the brine can be higher than all the other expenditures considered. For example, to reach the 60 ◦C proposed by Molinari et al. [20] the cost of heating the brine would result in a TLC 2 times and 3 times higher for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. Such a high TLC for the pretreatment stage alone could jeopardize the economic feasibility of the complete brine mining pro-cess. However, at room temperature the Ca(II) removal % is about 50 %. Therefore, other alternatives must be evaluated, such as increasing the pH of Ca(II) precipitation stage (authors reported that it is possible to reach a 60 % Ca(II) removal at pH 9.5) or decreasing the temperature of Ca(II) precipitation. For scenario 1 it is possible to have 80 % Ca(II) removal at 50 ◦C with a TLC of about 2.7 €/m3 inlet, a value similar to the TLC for scenario 2 at room temperature. It is clear that scenario 1 would be the best option since it presented lower values of OPEX and CAPEX in all the scenarios proposed. The largest concern regarding scenario 1 was the cost of membrane replacement due to scaling in NF. However, the economic analysis showed that other expenditures were more significant. The membrane with the highest selectivity factor between mono-valent and multivalent species for scenario 1 was PRO-XS2, for minor and major elements. Although this membrane presented the lowest permeate flux resulting in the highest CAPEX and OPEX among the three Table 4 CAPEX and OPEX for the 2 scenarios proposed in this case study, considering the 3 membranes tested and excluding energy consumption of Ca(II) precipitation.

Desalination 549 (2023) 11632111membranes, this did not reflect in a big difference economically since the variation between membranes was lower than 10 % for the TLC of the pre-treatment stage. As the difference between CAPEX and OPEX is so small, membrane selectivity should be prioritized over permeate flux since higher selectivity results in higher materials recovery. For example, Mg(II) was selected as one of the elements with higher eco-nomic potential regarding SWDP brine mining [13]. As the Mg(II) re-covery is designed for the concentrate stream, the amount of Mg(II) in the NF concentrate should be as high as possible. In this case, for the brine production of the Fonsalía SWDP, the NF270 membrane concen-trate stream would contain about 3,000 ton Mg(II)/year less than the concentrate stream obtained by the PRO-XS2, whereas the Fortilife XC-N membrane concentrate stream would contain about 1,000 ton Mg(II)/ year less than PRO-XS2. Therefore, as mentioned before, the efficiency of multivalent and monovalent separation was a priority to ensure the maximum recovery of minerals and metals from brine, hence the membrane PRO-XS2 was selected for the pre-treatment of brine coming from the Fonsalía SWDP. Table 5 collects the summary of the trade-offs between cost and membrane performance (for the best scenario) that should be considered in this case. 4. Conclusions The lack of primary resources in the EU is promoting the need for implementing circular economy schemes, such as the recovery of raw materials from SWDP brines. However, it is necessary to pretreat such streams to maximize the recovery of these materials. This study postu-lates two pre-treatment scenarios based on a combination of Ca(II) removal
