This	 led	to	the	issuance	of	several	policies	by	the	government	to	ensure	economic	recovery.	Therefore,	this	study	aims	to	examine	the	government	policies	implemented	as	a	response	to	the	impact	of	COVID-19.	These	policies	are	generally	grouped	into	four,	which	include	fiscal,	monetary,	macroprudential,	and	emergency	liquidity.	A	descriptive	qualitative	method	was	used	to	analyze	their	performance	in	dealing	with	the	economic	crisis	caused	by	COVID-19	using	Nvivo12	Plus	software.	The	results	showed	that	the	most	widely	used	is	fiscal	policy,	 with	 62%,	 followed	 by	 macroprudential	 with	 20%,	 while	 monetary	 and	 emergency	liquidity	are	9%	and	6%,	respectively.	This	implies	that	fiscal	policy	is	the	main	support	for	the	Indonesian	 government's	 economic	 recovery,	 especially	 in	 the	 economic	 recovery	 situation	during	the	pandemic	and	after.	Keywords:	Government	Policy;	Economic	Recovery;	Pandemic					Introduction	Economic	 recovery	 is	 often	intertwined	with	 the	problem	of	poverty,	which	has	become	a	crucial	challenge	 for	governments	 in	different	 countries	 and	a	public	issue	prioritized	in	the	Sustainable	Development	 Goals	 (SDGs)	 (Sugiharti,	Purwono,	Esquivias,	&	Jayanti,	2022).	This	problem	 is	 dynamic,	 complex,	 and	multidimensional,	 making	 it	 a	development	 priority	 (Purwono,	Wardana,	 Haryanto,	 &	 Khoerul	 Mubin,	2021).	 Meanwhile,	 the	 social	 protection	system	 is	 one	 of	 the	 policy	 options	 to	minimize	poverty	and	an	effort	 to	realize	the	agreed	sustainable	development	goals	(Rassanjani,	 Harakan,	 Pintobtang,	 &	Jermsittiparsert,	2019).	Van	 Leeuwen	 &	 Földvári	 (2016)	showed	 that	 the	 Indonesian	 government	has	 organized	 several	 absolute,	 relative,	cultural,	 and	 structural	 anti-poverty	programs.	 Meanwhile,	 Nursini	 (2019)	explained	 that	 poverty	 alleviation	 efforts	have	 also	 been	 established	 with	 several	strategies	 and	 policies	 in	 the	 context	 of	fiscal	 decentralization.	 It	 has	 been	discovered	that	there	are	two	strategies	to	alleviate	 poverty,	 which	 include	 1)	protecting	 poor	 families	 and	 groups	 of	I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Journal	of	Governance	Volume	7,	Issue	3,	September	2022  624 people	 by	 meeting	 their	 needs	 through	different	 fields;	 and	 2)	 organizing	 a	training	 program	 to	 empower	 those	affected	 to	 undertake	 new	 poverty	prevention	 efforts	 (Gunarsih,	 Sayekti,	 &	Dewanti,	2018;	Laurens	&	Putra,	2020).	COVID-19	affected	both	 the	health	and	 economy,	 as	 well	 as	 the	 social	situation	of	the	communities	in	Indonesia	(Musa,	 2022;	 Suryahadi,	 Al	 Izzati,	 &	Suryadarma,	2020).	The	pressure	was	also	observed	 to	 have	 extended	 to	 the	 world	economy	(Kickbusch	et	al.,	2020).	Several	studies	 found	 that	 the	 economies	 of	certain	 countries,	 such	 as	 Indonesia,	 the	United	States,	 Japan,	China,	 the	European	Union,	 and	 Singapore	 experienced	negative	 global	 economic	 growth	(Kickbusch	 et	 al.,	 2020;	 Li	 &	 Mutchler,	2020;	Tamesberger	&	Bacher,	2020;	Wang	&	 Sun,	 2021;	 Wolff	 &	 Ladi,	 2020;	 Yap,	2020)	 due	 to	 the	 COVID-19	 pandemic,	which	 has	 also	 caused	 resource	 scarcity,	social	 disorganization	 and	 dysfunction,	mental	 health,	 crime,	 and	 increasing	poverty	 as	 well	 as	 unemployment	 rates	(Aktar,	 Alam,	 &	 Al-Amin,	 2021;	Wasserman,	 Iosue,	 Wuestefeld,	 &	 Carli,	2020).	Gibson	&	Olivia	(2020)	investigated	the	problem	of	 the	pandemic	 in	 terms	of	inequality	 and	 poverty	 in	 Indonesia	 and	found	 a	 percentage	 decline	 in	 the	country's	economy.	An	increase	of	1.84%	was	 recorded	 in	 the	 unemployment	 rate,	which	 is	 29.12	 million	 people,	representing	 14.28%	 of	 the	 working-age	population	 due	 to	 COVID-19.	 This	 was	further	 explained	 to	 include	 2.56	million	previously	 unemployed,	 0.76	 million	affected	 workforces	 (BAK),	 1.77	 million	people	unable	to	work,	and	24.03	million	people	 who	 experienced	 a	 reduction	 in	their	working	hours	(Indonesia,	2019).	This	 is	 the	 reason	 the	 Indonesian	government	 issued	 policies	 to	 seek	economic	 recovery	 and	 investigate	 the	effect	of	rising	unemployment	(Gandasari	&	 Dwidienawati,	 2020;	 Olivia,	 Gibson,	 &	Nasrudin,	 2020).	 The	 government	regulation	 in	 lieu	 of	 Law	 Number	 43	 of	2020	deals	with	the	State	Financial	Policy	and	 Financial	 System	 Stability	 for	Handling	the	COVID-19	Pandemic	and/or	Facing	 the	 Threats	 That	 Endanger	 the	National	 Economy	 and/or	 Financial	System	 Stability.	 This	 regulation	 is	concerning	 the	 state	 financial	 policies,	which	 include	 regional	 financial	 and	financing	 policies	 (Disemadi	 &	 Shaleh,	2020;	Pati,	2020).	Meanwhile,	the	financial	system	 stability	 includes	 the	 policies	 for	handling	 financial	 institution	 problems	that	threaten	the	national	economy	and/or	financial	system	stability.	The	government	has	 begun	 to	make	 efforts	 to	 restore	 the	national	 economy	 through	 the	 National	Economic	Recovery	Program,	which	 is	 in	line	 with	 the	 declining	 economic	performance	leading	to	the	disruptions	in	health	 and	 economic	 recovery	 spending.	The	 aim	 is	 to	 maintain	 and	 improve	 the	economic	performance	of	business	actors	from	the	real	and	financial	sectors	during	the	COVID-19	pandemic	and	to	ensure	that	the	 poverty	 rate	 does	 not	 increase	massively	(Muhyiddin	&	Nugroho,	2021).	There	 is	 an	 increasing	 interest	 in	investigating	the	theoretical	framework	of	policy	response	to	the	impact	of	COVID-19	on	the	economy.	This	ranged	from	several	dynamics	 and	 factual	 facts	 related	 to	 the	I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Madani	&	Hartaman,	Analysis	of	Government	Policy	in	Economic	Recovery	During	Pandemic	in	Indonesia	     625 pandemic,	 economic	 recovery,	 and	poverty	 categorized	 into	 four	 aspects	 of	fiscal,	 monetary,	 macroprudential,	 and	emergency	 liquidity	 policies	(Suksmonohadi	 &	 Indira,	 2020).	 These	were	further	used	to	analyze	government	policy	 on	 economic	 recovery	 during	 the	COVID-19	pandemic	in	Indonesia.		Fiscal	policy	is	defined	as	the	use	of	government	 revenue	 and	 expenditure,	such	 as	 taxes,	 subsidies,	 government	transfers,	 and	 spending,	 to	 maintain	economic	 growth.	 The	 government’s	 role	in	 managing	 state	 finances	 through	 the	adjustment	of	revenues	and	expenditures	with	 the	 APBN	 greatly	 affects	 national	income,	 income	 distribution,	 job	opportunities,	 and	 national	 investment	(Maipita,	 Dan	 Jantan,	 &	 Razak,	 2010;	Nasiqoh,	2022;	D.	Silalahi	&	Ginting,	2020).	This	 budgeting	 deals	 with	 the	 supply	 of	public	 goods	 and	 resource	 mobilization,	while	 the	distribution	of	people's	 income	as	 a	 whole	 is	 an	 important	 element	 in	creating	 prosperity	 for	 the	 country.	Furthermore,	 fiscal	 policy	 regulates	 the	equilibrium	 of	 the	 unemployment	 rate,	price,	or	inflation	rate	(Ostrom	&	Ostrom,	2019;	 Priyono,	 2016),	 as	 well	 as	 state	revenues	 such	 as	 customs	 and	 excise,	foreign	 exchange,	 tourism,	 income	 tax,	land	 and	 building	 tax,	 imports,	 etc.	According	to	Sayadi	(2021),	fiscal	revenue	also	 regulates	 state	 expenditure	 on	 such	things	 as	 weapons,	 aircraft,	 government	projects,	 the	 construction	 of	 public	facilities	 and	 infrastructure,	 or	 other	programs	related	to	public	welfare.	Monetary	policy	is	a	central	bank’s	action	of	controlling	monetary	quantities,	such	as	 the	money	 supply,	 interest	 rates,	and	 credit.	 In	 Indonesia,	 the	 policy	 is	contained	 in	 Law	 No.	 23	 of	 1999,	 which	was	 later	amended	in	Law	No.	3	of	2004,	and	 it	 states	 that	 Bank	 Indonesia,	 as	 the	central	 bank,	 needs	 to	 achieve	 and	maintain	 stability	 in	 the	 value	 of	 the	rupiah,	 such	 as	 price	 stability	 (inflation)	and	 the	 rupiah	 exchange	 rate	 (Hubara,	Nurrahma,	&	Jannah,	2021).	Expansionary	monetary	 policy	 deals	 with	 overcoming	unemployment	 by	 increasing	 people's	purchasing	power;	increasing	the	amount	of	 money	 circulating	 in	 a	 recession	 or	depression;	 and	 the	 practice	 of	 easy	money	policy;	but	when	the	money	supply	is	 too	 high,	 known	 as	 inflation,	 a	 tight	money	 policy	 is	 implemented	 (Juhro,	Narayan,	&	Iyke,	2022;	Latifah,	2015).	Macroprudential	policy	is	an	effort	to	 monitor	 and	 evaluate	 the	 financial	system	as	a	whole	with	the	ultimate	goal	of	reducing	 crisis	 costs.	 Efendi	 (2019)	elucidated	 the	 role	 of	 this	 policy	 in	mitigating	 systemic	 risk,	 which	 includes	the	 reduction	 of	 potential	 financial	imbalances;	 building	 defenses	 against	economic	 downswings;	 and	 identifying	and	 addressing	 common	 exposures,	 risk	concentrations,	 linkages,	 and	dependencies	among	financial	institutions	that	have	the	potential	to	transmit	risks	to	the	financial	system	as	a	whole	(Qudraty	&	Suriani,	 2017).	 The	 macroprudential	policy	has	two	dimensions	to	measure	the	existence	 of	 systemic	 risk,	 and	 these	include	 the	 risk	 in	 different	 financial	institutions	 interconnected	 through	 the	balance	sheet	(cross-sectional	dimension)	and	systematic	risk	that	occurs	from	time	to	time	between	the	financial	system	and	the	 real	 economy	 through	 the	 credit-to-I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Journal	of	Governance	Volume	7,	Issue	3,	September	2022  626 GDP	 ratio,	 banks'	 aggregate	 liquidity	conditions,	 and	monetary	 amounts	 (time	dimension)	(Akbar	&	Wibowo,	2021;	Jeon,	Yao,	Chen,	&	Wu,	2022;	Yoel,	2016).	Emergency	liquidity	is	central	bank	money	 loans	 or	 securities	 that	 serve	 as	collateral	in	the	money	market	during	the	liquidity	 difficulties	 of	 the	 national	economy,	 specifically	 in	 extraordinary	situations	and	in	times	of	crisis.	This	helps	to	 overcome	 the	 temporary	 and	extraordinary	 liquidity	 shortages	 in	financial	 institutions	 caused	 by	 market	pressures	 or	 company-specific	 pressures	(Achmad,	Sulistiyono,	&	Handayani,	2021;	Karno	 Widigdo,	 2020).	 Furthermore,	 it	refers	 to	 funds	 outside	 of	 normal	monetary	 operating	 policies	 to	 enable	banks	 or	 financial	 institutions	 that	 are	experiencing	liquidity	difficulties	to	repay	their	debts.	Another	study	described	it	as	a	short-term	 funding	 loan	 that	 is	 intended	for	 solvent	 banks	 that	 are	 experiencing	temporary	 solvency	 but	 illiquid	 liquidity	conditions	 with	 collateral	 requirements	(Gauthier,	 Lehar,	 Pérez	 Saiz,	 &	 Souissi,	2015).	 It	 is	 important	 to	 note	 that	emergency	 liquidity	 is	 not	 only	 provided	for	 solvent	 banks	 that	 are	 experiencing	temporary	 liquidity	 difficulties	 (this	 is	considered	a	 traditional,	 conventional,	 or	classic	 ELA)	 but	 also	 given	 to	 insolvent	banks	 in	 crises	 as	 requirements	 for	collateral	 known	 as	 the	 haircut	 system	(Duygan-Bump,	 Parkinson,	 Rosengren,	Suarez,	&	Willen,	2013;	Lastra,	2016).	The	 policy	 responses	 to	 overcome	the	 impact	 of	 COVID-19	 among	 all	 the	government	policies	 described	 above	 are	grouped	 into	 four,	 which	 include	 fiscal,	monetary,	 macroprudential,	 and	emergency	liquidity.	Figure	1.

The	 data	 collected	 was	processed	 through	 the	 software	 and	compared	with	predetermined	indicators.	Moreover,	 the	 coding	 process	was	 based	on	 the	 type	 of	 policy	 utilized	 in	 dealing	with	 the	 pandemic,	 while	 classification	Types of Policies to Overcome Covid-19Fiscal PolicyMacroprudential PolicyMonetary policyEmergency LiquidityI I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Madani	&	Hartaman,	Analysis	of	Government	Policy	in	Economic	Recovery	During	Pandemic	in	Indonesia	     627 refers	 to	 the	 process	 of	 retranslating	 the	encoded	 data	 and	 sorting	 with	 Nvivo	cross-tabulation	in	order	to	compare	each	data	 point.	 The	 model	 used	 in	 Nvivo	 is	called	 a	 five-step	 analysis,	 in	 which	 the	final	 stage	 is	 displayed	 in	 the	 form	 of	graphs	and	tables	(Woolf	&	Silver,	2017).	Result	and	Discussion	The	COVID-19	pandemic	caused	an	increase	in	the	percentage	of	poor	people	in	most	provinces	 in	 Indonesia,	such	that	22	out	of	34	provinces	had	been	affected,	according	 to	 BPS	 data	 in	 June	 2020.	Poverty	due	to	the	pandemic	continues	to	spread	among	community	groups,	and	this	has	 prompted	 the	 government	 to	 take	strategic	steps	to	suppress	its	increase.	Figure	2.	Percentage	of	Poverty	Rate	in	Indonesia	2019-2021		Source:	Processed	by	the	Author	(2022)	The	data	for	2019,	2020,	and	2021	showed	that	the	average	poor	population	in	 Indonesia	 had	 reached	 10.68%,	indicating	 that	 poverty	 is	 still	 a	 serious	problem.	 It	 was	 observed	 that	 Papua	Province	had	the	highest	in	the	last	three	years	because	of	its	low	development	level	in	education,	health,	and	welfare,	thereby	causing	 it	 to	 be	 the	 poorest	 area.	Meanwhile,	 the	 results	 in	 2019	 revealed	that	Bali	Province	had	the	lowest	poverty	rate	in	three	previous	years.	The	increase	in	 poverty	 experienced	 in	 almost	 all	provinces	in	2020	was	due	to	the	COVID-19	 pandemic,	 but	 it	 has	 been	 reduced	 in	2021,	 specifically	 in	 30	 provinces	 of	 the	country.	This	success	came	from	the	effort	of	 the	 Indonesian	 government	 in	 dealing	with	 the	 pandemic,	 which	 goes	 hand	 in	hand	with	the	country’s	economic	growth.	It	is	concluded	that	the	National	Economic	Recovery	 Program	 conducted	 in	 2021	yielded	 good	 results	 due	 to	 the	 positive	economic	growth	recorded.		Figure	3.

It	 was	observed	 that	 the	 country’s	 economy	slumped	at	the	beginning	of	the	COVID-19	outbreak	 in	 Q2	 of	 2020	 but	 was	 able	 to	survive	and	grow	positively	in	Q2	of	2021.	Therefore,	 there	 is	a	need	to	analyze	 this	policy	that	helped	to	recover	the	economy	from	the	pandemic.			Analysis	 of	 Government	 Policy	 in	Indonesia's	 Economic	 Recovery	 Amid	the	COVID-19	Pandemic	Suksmonohadi	 &	 Indira	 (2020)	grouped	 policy	 responses	 for	 addressing	COVID-19’s	 impact	 into	 four,	 which	include	fiscal,	monetary,	macroprudential,	and	 emergency	 liquidity.	 The	 significant	impact	of	 the	economic	downturn	due	 to	COVID-19	 has	 prompted	 the	 government	authorities	 to	 take	 aggressive	 steps.	 The	authorities	 also	 launched	 several	 stimuli	as	an	addition	to	the	policy	measures	that	strengthen	the	health	sector	to	overcome	the	 impact	 of	 the	 economic	 downturn.	These	 policy	 targets	 are	 very	 broad,	ranging	 from	 households,	 corporations,	MSMEs,	 and	 even	 local	 governments,	 as	well	 as	 targeting	 different	 economic	sectors.	Figure	4.	Types	of	Government	Policies	in	Overcoming	the	Economic	Crisis	in	the	Pandemic													Source:	Data	processed	through	Nvivo12Plus	The	 analysis	 showed	 that	 fiscal	policy	was	the	most	widely	used	with	62%,	followed	 by	macroprudential	 policy	with	20%,	 while	 monetary	 and	 emergency	liquidity	 were	 9%	 and	 6%,	 respectively.	This	result	is	certainly	interesting	because	the	 government	 was	 consistent	 with	 the	use	 of	 policies	 globally,	 as	 published	 by	Yale	 University,	 which	 shows	 that	 fiscal	policy	 is	 the	 most	 used,	 followed	 by	macroprudential,	 monetary,	 and	emergency	liquidity.	It	is	important	to	note	that	South	Korea	and	the	US	are	the	most	aggressive	countries	in	enforcing	policies,	particularly	 fiscal	 and	 macroprudential.	Meanwhile,	 it	 has	 been	 discovered	 that	fiscal	 policy	 is	 the	 mainstay	 of	 the	Indonesian	 government's	 economic	recovery.			Fiscal	Policy	during	the	Pandemic	I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Madani	&	Hartaman,	Analysis	of	Government	Policy	in	Economic	Recovery	During	Pandemic	in	Indonesia	     629 Fiscal	 policy	 is	 defined	 as	 the	actions	 taken	 by	 the	 government	concerning	income	and	expenditure	(D.	E.	Silalahi	&	Ginting,	2020).	 It	 is	 focused	on	the	transfer	effects	in	different	important	sectors,	 such	 as	 income	 and	unemployment	 risk	 management	 as	 a	response	 to	 the	 COVID-19	 crisis	 (Bayer,	Born,	 Luetticke,	 &	 Müller,	 2020;	 Elenev,	Landvoigt,	 &	 Van	 Nieuwerburgh,	 2020;	Faria-e-Castro,	 2021).	 It	 is	 important	 to	note	 that	 the	 analytical	 model	 in	 this	present	study	is	simpler	than	other	models	and	allows	for	a	broader	fiscal	policy	with	much	 richer	 settings	 in	 terms	 of	governance	 heterogeneity.	 The	 economic	crisis	 caused	 by	 the	 COVID-19	 pandemic	has	 prompted	 many	 governments	 to	provide	economic	stimulus	through	fiscal	policy	 (Bui,	 Dräger,	 Hayo,	 &	 Nghiem,	2022),	relating	to	income	and	expenditure.	This	 policy	 is	 observed	 in	 government	regulation	 No.	 3	 of	 2020	 concerning	 the	implementation	 of	 a	 recovery	 program	applied	 to	deal	with	 threats	and	stabilize	the	 financial	 system	 in	 order	 to	 save	 the	national	 economy.	 An	 indicator	 of	 fiscal	policy	 that	 has	 a	 positive	 effect	 is	 the	realization	 of	 capital	 expenditures	 in	Indonesia,	which	increased	in	2021.	Figure	5.	Capital	Expenditure	Realization	Of	Provincial	Government	In	Indonesia	(thousand	rupiahs)	2019-2021		Source:	Processed	by	the	Author	(2022)	The	capital	expenditure	data	of	33	provinces	in	the	last	3	years	decreased	in	2020	 but	 increased	 drastically	 in	 several	areas	 in	 2021,	 such	 as	 Banten,	 South	Sulawesi,	 West	 Java,	 Aceh,	 and	 West	Papua.	 The	 BPS	 data	 showed	 that	 the	realization	 of	 capital	 expenditure	 in	Indonesia	 rose	 by	 133.7%	 (q-to-q)	 and	rose	by	10.6	%	(y-on-y).	 It	was	observed	that	 the	capital	expenditure	budget	has	a	positive	 effect	 on	 poverty	 reduction	 in	Indonesia	when	 juxtaposed	with	 poverty	rate	data.	Fiscal	 policy	 also	 creates	 a	 better	investment	 climate	 for	 capital	 market	players,	especially	investors,	to	enable	the	state	 to	 generate	 more	 revenue	 from	business	taxes	(NISP,	2021).	Realization	of	investment	 in	 Indonesia	 in	 the	 second	quarter	 of	 2021	 between	 April	 and	 June	increased	by	16.2%	compared	to	the	same	period	 in	 the	 previous	 year	 (Rp.	 191.9	trillion),	 as	 published	 by	 the	 Ministry	 of	Investment/Investment	 Coordinating	Agency	(BKPM),	which	reached	Rp.	223.0	trillion.	Furthermore,	there	was	also	data	01.000.000.0002.000.000.0003.000.000.0004.000.000.0005.000.000.0006.000.000.000 AcehNorth SumateraWest SumateraRiauSouth SumateraJambiBengkululampungWest JavaCentral  JavaDI Yogyakarta East JavaWest KalimantanCentral KalimantanSouth KalimantanEast KalimantanNorth SulawesiCentral SulawesiSouth SulawesiBaliSoutheast Sulawesi West Nusa… East Nusa…MalukuPapuaNorth MalukuBantenBangka BelitungGorontaloKepulauan  RiauWest PapuaWest SulawesiNorth Kalimantan2019 2020 2021I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Journal	of	Governance	Volume	7,	Issue	3,	September	2022  630 on	 cumulative	 investment	 realization	 for	the	period	of	January	to	June	2021,	which	reached	Rp.	442.8	trillion.	The	percentage	of	 investment	 realization	 in	 Java	 Island	based	on	distribution	was	52.4%	with	an	investment	value	of	Rp.	100.6	trillion,	but	for	other	parts	of	the	country,	it	was	47.6%	with	 an	 investment	 value	 of	 Rp.	 91.3	trillion.	Khan	 (2007)	 describes	 how	investment	 is	 one	 of	 the	 influential	indicators	for	economic	growth	because	it	has	 a	 positive	 impact	 on	 the	 production	process	in	an	increasingly	active	business	and	 also	 increases	 household	consumption.	Fiscal	policies	that	promote	investment	 have	 a	 positive	 correlation	with	 the	 country's	 infrastructure	development,	 which	 aids	 economic	recovery.	BKPM	(2021)	discovered	that	an	increase	in	national	income	or	GDP	is	able	to	 support	 the	 development	 efforts	undertaken	 by	 the	 government.	 For	example,	 investors	 were	 able	 to	 give	positive	sentiment	to	keep	realizing	their	investments,	 whether	 they	 are	 in	 the	preparation,	 construction,	 or	 production	stage,	 because	 of	 the	 enactment	 of	 Job	Creation	 Law	 No.	 11	 of	 2020	 and	 its	operational	 guidelines	 in	 the	 form	 of	 PP	No.	 5	 of	 2021,	 which	 licensed	 the	Implementation	 of	 Risk-Based	 Business.	This	led	to	several	groundbreakings	by	the	companies	from	April	to	June	2021	as	the	investment	was	successful.	The	 dominant	 fiscal	 policy	 issued	by	the	Indonesian	government	also	led	to	several	 budget	 realizations	 that	 had	 a	positive	 effect	 on	 economic	 growth	 and	national	economic	recovery,	including	the	realization	 of	 personnel	 expenses,	 which	increased	by	2.7%	in	2021,	the	increase	in	the	 realization	 of	 goods	 and	 services	expenditures	by	25.1%;	and	an	increase	in	the	 realization	 of	 social	 assistance	 by	23.5%.		Policies	 on	 macroprudential,	monetary,	and	emergency	liquidity	The	 macroprudential	 policy	received	 only	 20%	 of	 all	 the	 policies	implemented	 by	 the	 Indonesian	government,	 while	 monetary	 and	emergency	liquidity	received	9%	and	6%,	respectively.	 It	 was	 discovered	 that	 this	policy	 maintained	 the	 stability	 of	Indonesia's	 financial	 system	 amidst	 the	pressures	 of	 the	 COVID-19	 pandemic	(Junaedi,	 Arsyad,	 Norman,	 Romli,	 &	Salistia,	 2021;	 Wismayadi,	 2021).	Indonesia's	macro-financial	conditions	are	overshadowed	by	the	uneven	recovery	of	the	 global	 economy,	 which	 is	 due	 to	 the	magnitude	 of	 the	 fiscal	 and	 monetary	stimulus	 as	 well	 as	 the	 development	 of	different	 vaccinations	 and	 efforts	 to	 deal	with	 the	 spread	 of	 the	 disease.	 The	increase	 in	 COVID-19	 cases	 due	 to	 the	spread	 of	 the	 delta	 variant	 is	 very	 rapid	and	has	increasingly	colored	the	dynamics	of	 global	 financial	 markets	 based	 on	 the	Fed's	 planned	 signal	 to	 normalize	 policy	(tapering)	 at	 the	 end	 of	 2021.	 It	 is	important	 to	 note	 that	 maintaining	financial	 sector	 resilience	 is	 the	 role	 of	Bank	 Indonesia,	 the	 government,	 and	relevant	 authorities	 in	 implementing	shared	 responsibility	 in	 the	 financial	sector.	This	 is	the	reason	various	policies	are	 synergized	 with	 extraordinary	measures	 under	 the	 National	 Economic	Recovery	 program	 to	 overcome	 the	I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Madani	&	Hartaman,	Analysis	of	Government	Policy	in	Economic	Recovery	During	Pandemic	in	Indonesia	     631 adverse	 effects	 of	 the	 pandemic	 on	 the	economy	 and	 financial	 system,	 promote	intermediation,	 and	 accelerate	 national	economic	 recovery.	 This	 synergy	 is	pursued	 through	 formulation	 and	implementation	under	the	umbrella	of	the	Financial	System	Stability	Committee.		Conclusion	The	 policies	 implemented	 by	 the	Indonesian	 government	 to	 address	 the	impact	 of	 the	 COVID-19	 pandemic	 were	categorized	into	four,	which	include	fiscal,	monetary,	 macroprudential,	 and	emergency	 liquidity.	 It	 was	 discovered	that	fiscal	policy	was	the	most	widely	used	with	 62%,	 followed	 by	 macroprudential	policy	 with	 20%,	 while	 monetary	 and	emergency	 liquidity	 had	 9%	 and	 6%,	respectively.	 Fiscal	 policy,	 therefore,	became	 the	 main	 choice	 for	 economic	recovery	 as	 indicated	 by	 its	 positive	effects,	 such	 as	 an	 increase	 in	 capital	expenditures	during	the	second	quarter	of	2021	 by	 16.2%	 compared	 to	 the	 same	period	in	the	previous	year.	This	enabled	the	 government	 to	 increase	 its	expenditures	 on	 personnel,	 goods	 and	services,	 and	 the	 provision	 of	 social	assistance.
