Petroleum Engineering   Montana Tech of the University of Montana 2015  ii Abstract The objective of this work is to determine optimal inter-well spacing and hydraulic fracture length of the Three Forks assets in the Williston Basin operated by SM Energy. SM Energy is an independent exploration and production company with operations across North America, mainly in Texas and North Dakota. SM Energy recently switched to infill drilling development in their North Dakota assets and is interested in knowing the economically optimal number of wells that can be drilled per two-section drilling unit.   A simulation approach was taken in this research to address SM Energy’s issue. For research purposes a small pilot area was chosen from the Williston Basin with twelve operating wells. The pilot area is located at Colgan Field, Williston Basin North Dakota USA. The geological and reservoir model of the pilot area was simulated in Petrel and hydraulic fracture properties were obtained from SM Energy and incorporated into the Petrel model.   After building a sound geological model the next focus was to match observed production data from the wells in the study area. After validating the model by successful history matching, the simulated model was used to answer the study question. The study question was answered by evaluating different case scenarios with symmetrical well spacing and varying well densities. Economic analysis was performed using current drilling costs, operating costs and a range of oil prices. Results from economic analysis were used to determine the most profitable situation for SM Energy.  Another focus of this thesis was on high water cuts in the operating wells. The study wells are operating around 50% water cut. In this work water influx was modelled using different aquifer models and flow geometries to match the water production data from the field. This work determined the number of wells that can be drilled economically in the Three Forks asset. In addition, SM Energy also benefits by understanding the predominant source of water influx in the study area.    iii Dedication I dedicate this thesis to my parents K.S.

Introduction The main objective of this thesis is to determine optimal inter-well spacing and hydraulic fracture length for production from the Three Forks formation of Northwestern North Dakota through reservoir simulation. The purpose of this work is to better understand and provide solutions for operational problems faced by SM Energy. SM Energy focuses their drilling in the Bakken and Three Forks formations in their Gooseneck prospects in McKenzie, Williams and Divide Counties, North Dakota. As an operator, SM Energy faces challenges such as high water cut in newly drilled wells, developing effective stimulation strategies, and determining optimal well spacing.  The study area for this project is Colgan field, Gooseneck prospect (27) Divide County, North Dakota. As of January 2014, thirty-four wells have been drilled in the Colgan field to hold the lease for the acreage, but additional infill wells must be drilled to maximize recovery. In this work, twelve operating wells in the Colgan field selected to study. A geological model of the study area constructed based on data from the operator and public domain sources. Because our study area has low permeability, all twelve wells are hydraulically fractured. The hydraulic fracturing properties were obtained from the SM Energy and the results were incorporated into the reservoir simulation model. After gaining confidence in the simulation model through history matching, the model used to answer the study question.  Another important aspect of this project was to understand the water production from the study area. Currently, the field produces a range of water cuts between 25-60% with an average 50% water cut field-wide. No source of water influx has been identified so far. To better understand this problem, this study investigated the effects of various aquifer models to simulate the water production from these wells. Water production increases the operating costs because 2 produced water must be treated for impurities and re-injected back into the ground. Identifying the source and the pattern of water influx will help the operating company to decrease the capital cost for future developments.  The desired outcome of this project is to determine the optimal combination of well density and fracture length required to produce Three Forks formation reserves most economically. If successful, this research will help SM Energy plan their future development strategies in the Williston Basin as well as advance the understanding of unconventional reservoirs.  Problem Statement This thesis investigated a pilot area in the Williston Basin Three Forks formation to determine the optimal inter-well spacing and hydraulic fracture length to maximize economic recovery.  3 2. Background The Williston Basin is a sedimentary basin as shown in Figure 1 extending across North Dakota, South Dakota and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Williston Basin is a prolific oil producing area, producing from many geologic formations. The Three Forks, a Devonian aged formation, is one of these oil-producing strata and is the subject of this study.     Figure 1: Extent of Williston Basin in USA and Canada   Figure 2 shows the study area, which is located in Colgan field, Divide County in North Dakota. The study area consists of twelve operating wells in sections 13, 24, 17, 18, 19 and 20 in Township 163 and Ranges 101 and 100 W, as shown in Figure 3. 4  Figure 2: Colgan Field, Divide County, North Dakota     Figure 3: Map Showing Twelve Wells in Study Area  Initially little was known about the Three Forks formation and it was generally thought to be unproductive. However, in recent years the Upper Three Forks formation has developed into a significant resource play in the Williston Basin (1). Figure 4 shows the stratigraphic column of Colgan Field 5 the petroleum source rocks and reservoir in the Williston Basin (4). Oil production from the Three Forks is enabled by both horizontal drilling technologies, which expose a larger amount of reservoir to the wellbore than vertical wells, and hydraulic fracturing, which stimulates movement of hydrocarbons in low permeability reservoirs.      Figure 4: Stratigraphic Column of the Petroleum Source Rocks  and Reservoir in Williston Basin. (Webster, 1984)  According to United States Geological Survey (USGS) assessment methodology, there are undiscovered reserves estimated at 7.4 billion barrels of oil, 6.7 trillion cubic feet of associated/dissolved natural gas, and 0.53 billion barrels of natural gas liquids in the Bakken and Three Forks formations in the United States portion of the Williston Basin (1). The USGS assessment of the Bakken formation and underlying Three Forks formation is that “oil generated in the upper and Lower Bakken shale members migrated locally into low-permeability and variable porosity reservoirs to dolomitized units of Three Forks formation” (1). This geologic 6 sequence gives us a hint about the movement of water and pressure of natural fractures in the formation and will help to model the water influx in this basin.  The Devonian-aged Three Forks pay zone thickness ranges up to 12 feet and can be found at a depth of approximately 8,100 feet true vertical depth (TVD). Typical Three Forks wells in the Gooseneck prospect have a total measured depth of 18,000 feet that includes an approximately two-mile horizontal section. Sitchler and Cherian (4) reported that the Three Forks formation has low reservoir porosity (less than 8%) and permeability (less than 0.1md). A summary of pay zone thickness, broken down into a dolomite layer and a silty shale layer, is given in Table I. The upper bench pay zone thickness is around 7 to 8 feet in the study area (27). The total thickness of the Three Forks formation is approximately 110 feet to 260 feet basin wide. It is believed that the Three Forks zone has oil potential below our study area pay zone (1). It also could be a possibility that there is oil migration from the zones below to the upper Three Forks bench. In this work the zone below the upper Three Forks bench will be evaluated for oil potential.

Literature Review The goal of this literature review is to understand the complex geological structure of Three Forks formation. An Independent Study course was undertaken with Professor Burt Todd, Montana Tech Petroleum Engineering Department in the Fall of 2013 to research Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) publications related to the Three Forks formation in the Williston Basin. The results of which are presented here. Since the Three Forks formation is a relatively new prospect, not much literature was available, so the Bakken formation in the Williston Basin was also reviewed. Key learnings gained from the literature review were used to model geological and well completion properties of the twelve operating wells in the study area.   Bakken and Three Forks Geology in Williston Basin The Bakken formation is located in Western North Dakota, Eastern Montana, and Southern Saskatchewan Canada, as a subsurface formation within the Williston Basin. Figure 5 shows the Williston Basin and the extent of the Bakken formation within the basin.    Figure 5: Bakken Shale Formation Distribution within the Williston Basin (25). 8  The Bakken complex is a rock unit from the late Devonian to early Mississippian age occupying 200,000 square miles of the subsurface in the Williston Basin (refer to Figure 3). The Bakken complex consists of the Bakken shale and its adjoining formations, the Three Forks or Sanish mudstone below, and Lodgepole formation above (13). Figure 6 shows the Bakken formation lying between the overlying Lodgepole formation, which is conformable in most areas, and the underlying Three Forks formation, which is unconformable. Cox and Cook (2) state that the Bakken formation is both Devonian and Mississippian in age as the contact lies within the upper portion of the Middle member. The Bakken formation is composed of three distinct members - the Upper Shale Member, a Middle Siltstone Member and a Lower Shale Member. The Upper and Lower Bakken Shales are highly organic rich and serve as the petroleum source rocks for both Bakken and Three Forks formations.   Figure 6: Schematic Cross-Section Across the Williston Basin Showing three members of the Bakken Formation and the on lapping relationship with the Three Forks  In North Dakota, the Middle Bakken Member can reach up to 80 feet of thickness at depths approximately 9,500-10,000 feet. However, Zander and Czehura (6) said that toward the 9 west in Montana, the Middle Bakken thins to 6 to 15 feet of pay at approximately 10,000 feet in depth. This gives us a good understanding about variation in pay zone thickness throughout Williston Basin. Warpinski and Mayerhofer (7) reported that porosity and permeability within the middle member are generally very low. Porosity averages 5%, while permeability averages around  0.04 mD. However, the highest values of permeability are associated with naturally occurring fractures. Iwere et al., 2012, report that water cut ranges between 0-55% depending on where the wells are located and whether the initial water saturation is in equilibrium (26). The temperature of the Middle Bakken Member is about 240 ͦ F, which is often referred to as the “Bakken Kitchen” where the oil is cooked and moved to other areas in the basin. Roth and Roth (5) observed that the Three Forks formation has been recently developed as a distinct reservoir in portions of Williston Basin. The reservoir properties were similar to that of the Middle Bakken Member, with the exception of the high water cut from the producing wells operating in the Three Forks formation.  The contact between the Bakken and Three Forks formations appears conformable in the deeper portions of the Basin and unconformable in the Basin flanks. The geology of the Three Forks can be subdivided into four units: the first, second, third and fourth benches (5). The first and second benches of the Three Forks are widespread across the Basin, while the third bench has the presence of more shale and anhydrites, and the fourth bench is locally developed. The Upper Three Forks bench consists of a dolomite interbedded with shale and had been the primary reservoir target to date (5). The type log for the Three Forks formation is shown in Figure 7 (11). The dolomite in the upper half of the target zone is approximately three feet 10 thick. The shale has a gamma signature of 140-160 API gamma ray units (GAPI), indicating the Upper Bench in the Three Forks formation is a shaly dolomite.    Figure 7: Type Log Showing Three Forks Formation (11)  SM Energy wells have been drilled in the 1st and 2nd benches in Three Forks formation in the Gooseneck and Colgan fields where the study area is located. The Three Forks formation in our study area ranges from approximately 8,100 to 8,200 feet TVD (2). The geologic model of the Bakken formation and underlying Three Forks formation implies that oil generated in the Upper and Lower Bakken shale members migrated locally into low-permeability and variable porosity reservoirs of the Middle Bakken member and dolomitized units of the Three Forks formation. The Pronghorn Member of the Bakken formation, which had previously been referred to as the “Sanish” sand has recently been placed within the Bakken petroleum system (1). The 11 Pronghorn member of the Bakken formation, although geologically and stratigraphically defined as part of the Bakken formation, is assessed with the Three Forks formation. Where present, the Pronghorn member is in fluid communication with the underlying Three Forks reservoirs. The operator suggested the Middle Bakken Member may be supplying the Three Forks with water along with crude oil. This is a theoretical idea, but this project will test the theory by modelling water influx to understand the migration of water into the Three Forks formation. Because of the geology of the Bakken system, a thorough analysis of log and core data is important in building the geological model. In this thesis a simulation approach was used to describe the geological structure of Three Forks formation. Too often unconventional reservoirs are considered “cookie cutter” developments where a winning formula is blindly applied with little technical analysis (2). However, achieving economic returns in a resource play can be challenging and requires careful planning and detailed evaluation. The thin net pay and the presence of water production in the Three Forks requires in-depth study to optimize recovery and economics of Three Forks production.   Effective Completion and Stimulation in Horizontal wells. Cox et al. (2) stated that unconventional resource plays could provide a long-term supply of oil and gas for North American energy demands. Wells completed in unconventional plays typically exhibit limited drainage areas and produce a majority of recoverable reserves at low rates. Due to the limited flow capacity of these reservoirs, typical development strategies include some form of horizontal wells stimulated with hydraulic fractures. Hydraulic fracturing is performed to create greater conductivity of fluids within the formation and improved communication with the reservoir and well bore.  12 The evolution of completion strategies includes increasing the lateral length and number of fracture stages, the method of stage isolation and proppant type and concentration. There is significant variability in the well completion methods across the Williston Basin. Zander and Czehura (6) stated that the main types of completion methods are cemented liner, open hole completion and uncemented preperforated liner. The uncemented, preperforated liner isolated with swell packers has become the most commonly employed method of completion in most Bakken wells, as shown in Figure 8. This completion method has a high degree of fracture control and excellent long term success rate (2).   Figure 8: Wellbore with Uncemented Preperforated Liner  Roundtree and Eberhard (8) said that most wells are positioned in a north-south or northwest-southeast orientation to take advantage of induced fracture propagation in the direction of maximum horizontal stress. But there is a debate whether transverse fractures are the best way of stimulating a well. Lolon and Cipolla (9) said that both longitudinal and transverse fractures are believed to be created during the stimulation process. However, single horizontal long laterals with numerous transverse fractures are the preferred method to achieve the desired Uncemented Preperforated Liner 13 reservoir contact in Bakken completions. Transverse fractures provide a small area of intersection with a horizontal wellbore, generally necessitating the use of higher conductivity proppants and multiple stages to improve the flow capacity of the connection between the fractures and well bore.  Rankin and Thibodeau (10) stated that research by operators in the Williston Basin suggests that success in the Bakken/Three Forks can be achieved with long laterals utilizing a high number of fracturing stages placed within the formation with precise geosteering. When these goals are pursued simultaneously, production and profitability are dramatically improved. It is clear that the performance of a well is directly proportional to the contributing length of the lateral, which in turn is directly related to the effectiveness of well placement and the fracture stimulation. In this study the length of the fractures was adjusted with respect to number of wells operating in the field to optimize production and ultimate recovery.  Reservoir Modeling of Horizontal Wells in Three Forks Formation The Bakken/Three Forks oil play is extremely active with more than 2,500 horizontal wells drilled in Montana, North Dakota, and Saskatchewan during the past decade (10). Horizontal wells are important because they offer solutions to the problem of producing oil and gas in reservoirs where vertical wells produce at uneconomic rates. Horizontal wells are appropriate for thin reservoirs, reservoirs with high water influx, reservoirs with natural fractures, reservoirs with low permeability and high anisotropy, and reservoirs with poor sweep efficiency (5).  The use of unconventional wells in the Williston Basin instrumented with downhole inflow control devices allows for even greater flexibility in production. Because unconventional 14 wells can be very expensive to drill, complete and instrument, it is important to optimize their deployment, which requires accurate prediction of their performance (5).  Roundtree and Eberhard (8) stated that accurate modeling of flow from horizontal wells continues to pose several problems. One important aspect of horizontal well modeling is accurate representation of fine scale reservoir heterogeneity in the near-well regions. This issue arises because geological models typically include far more detail that can be accommodated in conventional reservoir simulation models. These problems can be handled with local grid refinement and by optimizing the coarse grid parameters. The desired approach in studying the Three Forks formation is to create a reservoir model with known reservoir properties obtained from public domain sources. For unknown reservoir properties, estimates based on the literature and previous research work done by the operators in the Williston Basin were used. The successful reservoir model would incorporate individual wells with accurate near-wellbore descriptions. Fracture design and proppant selection, economics and infill drilling potential rely on reservoir permeability; therefore it is critical to determine the permeability in this process. Core samples were obtained from SM Energy to determine the permeability and porosity of the Three Forks formation in the study area. Reservoir properties like porosity and permeability were initially modelled based on lab results, and were adjusted to achieve a better history match for the twelve operating wells in the study area.  Water Influx  Water influx is defined as replacement of produced fluids by formation water. Most petroleum reservoirs are underlain by water, and water influx into a reservoir almost always takes place at some rate when gas or oil is produced (21). Whether appreciable amounts of water 15 are produced along with gas or oil depends on the proximity of the productive interval to the oil-water contact or gas-water contact and whether the wells are coning (vertical wells) or cresting (horizontal wells).  The first phase in understanding water influx is determining the water influx mechanism. This step includes diagnosis, classification and characterization. The second phase identifies mathematical models that effectively simulate the aquifer, especially its deliverability. This phase includes estimating or history matching aquifer model parameters. The third and the final phase requires combining aquifer and reservoir models to forecast recovery effectively and to identify optimal depletion strategies. With that said the success of the final phase depends heavily on the success of the preceding two phases (21). Recognizing the effects of expansion of the connate water with the oil and gas reservoir and calculating the water influx across a boundary can be described using any of several aquifer models available. There are five aquifer models in theory and are discussed briefly below. The Van Everdingen Hurst (VEH) Model states that when an oil well is brought on production at a constant flow rate after a shut-in period, the pressure behavior is essentially controlled by the transient flowing condition (21). This flowing condition is defined as the time period during which the boundary has no effect on the pressure behavior. Van Everdingen and Hurst (1949) proposed solutions to the dimensionless diffusivity equation for two reservoir boundary conditions: constant terminal rate and constant terminal pressure. For the constant terminal rate boundary condition, the rate of water influx is assumed constant for a given period, and the pressure drop at the reservoir-aquifer boundary is calculated. For the constant terminal pressure boundary condition, a boundary pressure drop is assumed constant over some finite time period, and the water influx rate is determined.  16 The Carter-Tracy Model was developed to reduce the complexity of the VEH water influx calculations. In 1960, Carter and Tracy proposed a calculation technique that does not require superposition and allows direct calculation of water influx (21). Using the Carter-Tracy technique the cumulative water influx at any time can be calculated directly without involving superposition. In 1971, Fetkovich developed a method of describing the approximate water influx behavior of a finite aquifer for radial and linear geometries (21). The Fetkovich model is based on the premise that the productivity index concept will adequately describe water influx from a finite aquifer into a hydrocarbon reservoir. In other words, the water influx rate is directly proportional to the pressure drop between the average aquifer pressure and the pressure at the reservoir-aquifer boundary. This method neglects the effects of any transient period. Thus, in cases where pressures are changing rapidly at the aquifer-reservoir interface, predicted results may differ somewhat from other approaches. The first three models are unsteady-state models and are the most realistic. These models attempt to simulate the complex pressure changes that occur within the aquifer and between the aquifer and reservoir. As pressure depletion proceeds, the pressure difference between the reservoir and aquifer grows rapidly and then attains equilibrium with the reservoir. The unsteady state models are far more successful at capturing the dynamics of water influx than other models.  In contrast, the Schilthuis steady-state model assumes aquifer pressure remains constant. Schilthuis (1936) proposed a model of an aquifer that is flowing under steady state flow regime and modeled using Darcy’s equation (21). The influx constant is obtained when the reservoir pressure stabilizes. The pressure drop contributing to the influx is the cumulative pressure drop from the initial pressure. The water influx constant is calculated from the reservoir historical 17 production data over a number of selected time intervals, provided the rate of water influx is known. Although the water influx constant can only be obtained in this manner when reservoir pressure stabilizes, once the water influx constant has been found it may be applied to both stabilized and changing reservoirs.  The VEH model is the most computationally complex of these models. To address this limitation, the Carter-Tracy and Fetkovich models were created to be free of tables and charts (21). However, these models are only approximations to and simplifications of the VEH model. The VEH charts and tables were digitized and included in Petrel. So the time constraint is removed and the need for alternative models is diminished. In this project, all three “unsteady-state” models (VEH, Fetkovich and Carter Tracy) were used to match the actual field water production data. The model most closely matching the actual field production will be determined to be the best one and will be used for this simulation study. Once a water influx mechanism has been identified, it is important to monitor the producing wells closely and to minimize water production. Minimizing water production in edge water drives may require systematically shutting in flank wells once the advancing water reaches them. Minimizing water production in bottom water drives may require systematically cementing in lower perforations as the bottom water slowly rises. However, these strategies work best for traditional vertical wells. For long horizontal wells, as in our case, these strategies may not be applicable since the well bore is in contact with the reservoir horizontally. In this research, water influx was modelled with both edge water and bottom water drive. The most accurate water influx mechanism was selected based on how well that water influx model matched observed production performance.   18 4. Reservoir Model Building Modeling the study area was a two-step process: The first step was building the reservoir model and the second was including hydraulic fracture properties. In the reservoir model building phase, the geology of the formation was modeled in Petrel. Petrel is a reservoir modelling software platform by Schlumberger and is used for making exploration and production decisions. The hydraulic fracturing properties were obtained from SM Energy for the wells in the study area and then incorporated into the reservoir model. Initial simulation results were analyzed and adjusted as necessary to improve the history match.  Reservoir Modeling  Reservoir modeling is performed to obtain accurate performance predictions for hydrocarbon reservoirs under different operating conditions. The cost associated to drill and complete a single well in the study area is estimated at about 7 million dollars (28). The need for this project arises from the huge capital investment necessary to develop the acreage, so the well density must be assessed and minimized. Various factors such as reservoir rock properties, regional variations of fluid properties, and relative permeability characteristics must be considered during model building stage.  Simulation of petroleum reservoir performance is achieved by construction and operation of a model whose behavior imitates the performance of actual reservoir behavior. The purpose of taking the simulation approach in this project is to estimate the field performance under one or more producing scenarios. Whereas the field can be produced only once at considerable expense, a model can be produced or run many times at low expense over a short time frame. Observation of model results representing different producing conditions aids selection of an optimal set of producing conditions for the reservoir, i.e., well spacing and fracture length.  19 In this study, a range of scenarios was evaluated to provide decision makers with insight that can help them to decide how to economically commit limited resources to activities that achieve SM Energy economic objectives. Collecting data for the reservoir flow model is a good way to ensure that every important technical variable is considered. If the model is particularly sensitive to a particular parameter, then a plan should be made to reduce the uncertainty in the parameter.  The first phase in reservoir modelling is to build a geological model of the formation. SM Energy wanted to model a pilot area in Colgan field, Divide County North Dakota. The pilot area consists of six sections and twelve operating wells. Refer to Table I and Figure 9 for the description and location of the twelve operating wells. Since the study area wells are long and horizontal, each two-section drilling unit contains four wells drilled between 2011 and 2013.   Figure 9: Six Sections of Land with Twelve Study Wells   The well locations and wellbore deviation surveys were used to place the study wells in the model. Wellbore deviation files for the twelve operating wells includes measured depth, 20 inclination and azimuth were obtained from the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC) website (24).  After locating the wells into the model the next step was building the formation structures. For this model it was decided to have four different zones-the Middle Bakken, Lower Bakken, Three Forks and base of Three Forks formation. Among these four geological structures, the Three Forks is the only oil producing zone. There were no well logs available to build formation structural relationships between each zone. The well bore deviation data were used to define the Three Forks formation. The Three Forks formation was used as the base zone and the remaining three zones were modelled by changing the elevation accordingly. The Three Forks formation was assigned a thickness of ten feet and the Middle Bakken, Lower Bakken and base of the Three Forks formations were modelled ten to twenty feet thick in order to keep the hydraulic fractures contained within the model space. To make sure that this model is accurately representing the Three Forks formation, offset wells near the study area are also considered for the Three Forks depth and thickness, as shown in Table II and Figure 10.  Table II: Off Set Wells Operating Near the Study Area  Well Name/NDIC File No Distance From Study Area Well (Miles) Thickness (feet) Porosity (%) Barstad 1-30-1 0.23 10 7.0 Rud 1-19 0.25 8 6.5 Wanda 2-25-1 0.48 7 6.8 Wolter 13-21H 0.80 8 9.0 Clegg 2-29-11 0.72 9 8.5 State Wingress 41-35-1 1.55 10 6.0   21   Figure 10: Map Showing Neighboring Wells from Table II   Geological Modelling  Once the geologic structure was developed, geological properties were modelled for the four geological layers (Middle Bakken, Lower Bakken, Three Forks and base of the Three Forks). For this project there were no core analysis reports available from public domain sources. Fortunately, SM Energy provided two core samples from the nearby wells which are representative of the Three Forks formation in Colgan Field. The two 1” core plug samples received from SM Energy were obtained from the Tomlinson 3-1HN well. The two core plugs were obtained from the same well, but at different depths along the upper bench of the Three Forks formation. The Tomlinson 3-1HN is located in Township 161N Section 100W Range 1 and it is very near to the study area. One of the core samples had higher permeability than the Offset Wells 22 other core sample and was used for relative permeability tests which are discussed later in this section.  The core sample obtained from SM Energy was tested for permeability and porosity using a core Lab automated porosimeter-permeameter in Montana Tech Petroleum Engineering laboratory facilities. This advanced system can perform automated permeability and porosity tests at confining pressures up to 10,000 pounds per square inch (psi), and measure permeability ranging from 0.001 to 10 mD and porosity ranging from 0.1 to 40%. The core sample tests were performed three times to check the measurement for precision. There is also a leak check available in the system, in between each test it was mandatory to place a steel plug and to do a leak detection test. This particular step ensured integrity of the measurement.  The core sample was tested at confining pressures of 1,000, 1,500 and 2,000 psi. These tests were repeated three times. The purpose of conducting these tests at various confining pressures was to understand the pressure dependence on permeability. Before measuring porosity and permeability, the core samples were cleaned of residual fluids using solvents, then thoroughly dried. The number of cycles or amount of solvent which must be used depends on the nature of hydrocarbons being removed and the solvent used. Often more than one solvent is used, but in this case the core sample was cleaned three times using toluene as the solvent. As an initial guess for modelling purposes permeability was chosen from the table based on the highest measured values, this represents the cleanest core with the most repeatable results. Porosity was taken to be the average of the measured values. Initial modelling values of porosity and permeability of the Three Forks formation were chosen to be 6.5% and 0.075mD based on the data in Table III.   23 Table III: Core Sample Permeability and Porosity Results   Date Length (inch) Diameter (inch) P Confining (psia) Porosity (p.u) K air (mD) 9/25/2014 1.01 1 1000 6.520 0.0750 9/25/2014 1.01 1 1500 6.950 0.0600 9/25/2014 1.01 1 2000 6.083 0.0500  The next step in the modelling process was assigning the permeability and porosity for the other three zones in the model. In this model the Three Forks is the oil producing zone and the remaining three zones are not productive. The permeability and porosity of the Middle Bakken and the Lower Bakken shale were set to zero. However, these layers were still included in the simulation model to enable simulation of water production from the Middle Bakken member into the Three Forks formation. Table IV shows permeability and porosity properties for the four zones used in the simulation model.   Table IV: Permeability and Porosity for Different Zones  Zone Porosity (%) Permeability XY (mD) Permeability Z (mD) Number of layers Middle Bakken 0.00 0.0000 0.00000 3 Lower Bakken 0.00 0.0000 0.00000 2 Three Forks 6.50 0.0750 0.00750 5 Base of Three Forks 3.25 0.0375 0.00375 10   Horizontal permeability is modelled based on the core sample results from the laboratory. As a rule of thumb the permeability in Z direction is modelled to be 1/10th of that horizontal permeability (21). For the base of Three Forks formation the permeability and porosity were set 24 to be half the values of the Three Forks Formation, reflecting the shaly character shown on the gamma ray logs. In spite of the Three Forks being the oil producing zone in the model, storage capacity was created in the base of the Three Forks formation. This is done to simulate the water production from the base of the Three Forks formation and will be discussed in detail in the water influx modelling section. In this project the wire line logging data were the gamma ray logs used to provide control for geo-steering while drilling the well. Gamma ray logs for the twelve operating wells in the study area were imported into the respective wells to verify the depth of the Three Forks formation.   Relative Permeability The third and final step in the modelling process was to describe the relative permeability of the producing zone. Relative permeability is the ratio of effective permeability for a particular fluid to the absolute permeability. The absolute permeability is constant for a particular medium and independent of the fluid type. The ability to preferentially flow or transmit a particular fluid when other immiscible fluids are present in the reservoir is called as effective permeability (22). Typically effective permeability is lower than absolute permeability. The relative permeability of a fluid is a function of saturation.  The core sample was tested with both oil and water, and the core sample had a greater affinity to oil than water. The core sample was determined to be oil wet. In these experiments Three Forks oil sample and API brine were used for displacement.  Professor Richard Schrader (Montana Tech) and fellow student Cliff Goncalves (Montana Tech) performed relative permeability tests on two cores from the Three Forks formation that were obtained from SM Energy. The core samples were cleaned by flushing with 25 toluene to remove dust particles from the core sample. The core plug was placed in the core holder and initially saturated with oil which was then displaced with water. Even though the displacement was successful, there was inconsistency in the measured oil effective permeability values. The inconsistency was believed to be due to viscosity changes caused by temperature changes occurring overnight. To correct this problem, the core holder was placed in a constant temperature bath and maintained at 120 οF while the experiments were being performed with varying confining pressures. It takes approximately two months to perform experiments to calculate a single set of relative permeability curves. These experiments must be performed repeatedly to ensure consistent results. Due to time constraints in this project the relative permeability results were not included in the model. The Corey correlation available in Petrel for relative permeability curves was used for the modelling purpose as shown in Figure 11. The default end point saturations Swir is 0.2 and Sor is 0.8 were used to model relative permeability for the Three Forks Formation (13).  26   Figure 11: Relative Permeability Curve   Pressure Volume Temperature Properties After describing the rock properties the focus of reservoir model construction shifted to the fluid properties. Very little fluid Pressure Volume Temperature (PVT) analysis has been performed on the fluids from the Three Forks formation. SM Energy provided a sample of oil from the Colgan field. Oil viscosity and API gravity were measured on the oil sample. The viscosity of oil was measured to be 2.6 cP with an API gravity of 40 degrees at 60 οF. This was compared to the oil properties from NDIC website (24) and found to be in a reasonable range. In the reservoir model building process we are often faced with analysis of processes which require the physical properties of the reservoir fluids, but in many cases little or no laboratory measurements of properties are available. In such cases empirically derived correlations are used 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.910 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1Relative Permeability (Krw& K ro)Water Saturation (Sw)Relative PermeabilityKro Krw27 to complete the reservoir fluid description. This work considered the correlations for light oil and gas PVT properties to identify the bubble point pressure of 1,980 Psi using the Standing-Petrosky model. The production data from the twelve study wells suggested a solution gas oil ratio of 700 SCF/STB at the saturation pressure. Figure 12 shows the bubble point pressure at 1980 psi plotted and oil formation volume factor and solution gas oil ratio is plotted as a function of pressure. Figure 13 shows the bubble point pressure plotted against oil viscosity is plotted as a function of pressure to compare the viscosity change.

Gas and formation water properties were taken from wells near to the study area. The well Rindel 3-9 HD had water and gas analysis reports and is located about 20 miles away from the study area. The specific gravity for the gas is determined to be 0.976 and for water is determined to be 1.17, as shown in Tables V and VI. These properties were used in the reservoir fluid description to complete the water and gas descriptions.

During injection, the pressure in the well bore increases to a value called the breakdown pressure. Once the formation breaks down, a fracture is formed and the injected fluid flows through it. After the fracturing pressure has been released, the formation naturally expands and traps the proppant in the fracture, leaving behind a highly-conductive channel that bypasses the damaged region surrounding the well-bore, creating a larger planar surface area for flow from the drainage area and causing linear flow patterns in the drainage area. The larger surface area and the linear flow reduce the pressure drop required to produce the well as compared to pure radial flow. Hydraulic fracturing is an important component of Bakken and Three Forks well completions (4). The operator believes that all 12 wells in the study area have been effectively stimulated with a fracture half-length of approximately 550 feet (28). All the other properties such as fracture height, fracture width and fracture permeability were estimated based on previous knowledge and literature review done in the study area. All the study area wells are stimulated in twenty or twenty-six fracture stages.  The hydraulic fracturing model in Petrel used for this study has limitations. Increasing the number of fractures and fracture length per well did not affect the liquid production as expected.  The hydraulic fracturing properties used in the simulation model are shown in Table XV in Appendix A. For these reasons, hydraulic fracture properties were not varied in this study. 31   Water Influx Modelling Most oil and gas reservoirs have some amount of formation water. Modelling the encroachment of this water into oil and gas reservoirs is very important because it provides reservoir energy through pressure support. Water influx in this model was introduced not only to provide pressure support, but also to reproduce the observed water production data. In this study seven different water influx models available in Petrel were used to simulate water production. Surprisingly, all seven aquifer models predicted similar amounts of water production and pressure decline. Therefore, in this study the water influx mechanism was modeled using numerical model.  Reservoir-aquifer systems can be classified by three flow geometries: edge water drive, bottom water drive and linear water drive (21). In an edge water drive, the water moves into the flanks of the reservoir as a result of hydrocarbon production and subsequent pressure drop at the reservoir-aquifer boundary. The flow is essentially linear with negligible flow in the vertical direction. Bottom water drives occur in reservoirs with large areal extent and a gentle dip where the reservoir-water contact completely underlies the reservoir. The flow is essentially linear and, in contrast to the edge water drive, the bottom water drive has significant vertical flow. In linear-water drive, the influx is from one flank of the reservoir. The flow is strictly linear with a constant cross-sectional area.  The average water cut in the study area is about 50%, so water saturation plays an important role in the history matching process. Water saturation is defined as the fraction of pore space occupied by water. Water saturation can be determined by three methods. Water saturations can be calculated from resistivity well logs by application of an Archies law, model relating water saturation to porosity, connate water resistivity and various electrical properties. There were no resistivity logs available in the study area, so this method was not used to 32 calculate water saturation. Water saturations can be calculated by using laboratory capillary pressure measurements by application of a model relating water saturation to various rock and fluid properties and height above the free-water level. Since there was no known available oil-water contact in this work this method was also not used. The third method is the Dean Stark water volume determination on core samples. Due to lack of core samples this experiment was not used either to calculate the water saturations. The water saturation was determined to be 50% from the history matching process and will be discussed in chapter 5. In this study both edge water drive and bottom water drive were used to simulate water production. The operator suggested the water is produced from the edge, so edge water influx was tried first in the simulation model. Because the edge water drive did not simulate enough water production to match the field observed data, bottom water influx was tried. This was more successful in matching field observed data and will be discussed in detail in history matching section. A summary of parameters used to build the initial reservoir model is shown in Table VII. These parameters were subject to change during the history matching process. A comparison with the parameters changed in the history matching section is given at the end of chapter 5. The initial reservoir pressure was determined to be 3,500 psi based on drill stem tests from the well nearby to the study area (24). The Original Oil in Place (OOIP) for the model was calculated to be 3,177 MSTB in the six-section study area. This translates that the oil in the Three Forks Formation in the study area is around 529 MSTB/section of land which is validated using previous literature review done in the study area (1).   33 Table VII: Summary Initial Model Building Parameters  Parameter Three Forks formation Base of Three Forks formation Porosity (%) 6.5 - Permeability Horizontal (mD) 0.075 - Permeability Vertical (mD)  0.0075 - Corey Exponent O/W 3 - Average Thickness (ft.) 10 - Initial Pressure (Psi) 3500 - Solution Gas Oil Ratio (MSCF/STB) 0.7 - Bubble Point Pressure (Psi) 1980 - Fracture Half Length (feet) 550 - Fracture Permeability (mD) 10 - Number of Stages Per Well 26 - Fracture Width (inches) 0.3 - Fracture Height (feet) 25 - Water Saturation (%) 50 - Aquifer Permeability (mD)  0.075 - Aquifer Porosity (%) 6.5 -   Economic Analysis An Economic analysis was completed for this study.
