Adolescent chronic pain exists within a social context, affecting the lives ofadolescents, parents, peers, and wider family members. Typically, parental research hasfocussed on the negative impact on parents associated with parenting an adolescent withchronic pain. However, a small number of studies have identified positive parentaloutcomes and functioning, with a focus on parental resilience. This study sought to extendexisting knowledge by providing a detailed and contextualized understanding of howparental dyads experience and demonstrate resilience in response to parenting anadolescent with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) and the meaning that parentsascribe to these shared experiences.Design. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to conduct an in-depth qualitative interview study of parents of an adolescent with CRPS.Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via Skype with eight mother–father parental dyads of an adolescent aged 11–25 years with CRPS.Results. A single prominent theme ‘masking reality in the face of pain’ dominated theparental discourse and experience of resilience. Resilience was experienced as anincongruence between private distress and the perceived obligation to display sociallydesirable resilience behaviours to protect their child from their own distress.Conclusions. Study findings highlight the benefits of strength-based interventions toenhance parental resilience. This is particularly important since parental behaviours havebeen shown to influence child pain outcomes. Future research should seek to exploreresilience in different populations such as lone parents, siblings, and those parenting anadolescent with pain conditions other than CRPS.This is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits use, distribution andreproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.*Correspondence should be addressed to Abbie Jordan, Department of Psychology, Claverton Down, Bath BA2 7AY, UK (email:a.l.jordan@bath.ac.uk).Present address: Centre for Appearance Research Department of Health and Social Sciences Faculty of Health and AppliedSciences University of the West of England Frenchay Campus, Coldharbour Lane Bristol BS16 1QY UK.DOI:10.1111/bjhp.125411Statement of contributionWhat is already known on this subject? Chronic pain can have an all-encompassing negative impact on the lives of the adolescent, parentsand wider family. Parental resilience is central to the well-being and development of parents and children with long-term pain. Most parental studies in the context of paediatric pain have focussed solely on thematernal impact.What does this study add? This is the first qualitative study exploring resilience in parental dyads of an adolescent with CRPS. Resilience was experienced as an incongruence between private distress and an outward display ofresilience. Displaying resilience served several functions for parents but created a perceived sense of socialisolation.BackgroundPain is a common and often unremarkable experience in childhood and adolescence formany, with a small yet sizable number of young people going on to develop chronic painand associated disability (Forgeron&Stinson, 2014;Huguet&Miro, 2008). Chronic pain iscommonly defined as pain that persists beyond the typical course of an acute disease orreasonable time for an injury to heal, which is typically more than 3 months (Nicholaset al., 2019). A systematic review of community-based epidemiological studies identifiedthat 11–38% of children and adolescents experience chronic pain, with 5% of thesereporting significant pain-related dysfunction (King et al., 2011). Chronic pain may berelated to a disease or injury or can be idiopathic in aetiology (Jordan & Caes, 2020).Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic condition characterized by intenselocalized pain which affects children, adolescents and adults (Goh, Chidambaram, & Ma,2017;Weissmann&Uziel, 2016). Paediatric CRPS ismore prevalent in adolescent girls (deMos et al., 2007; Low, Ward, &Wines, 2007) and young people with CRPS report greaterpain intensity and functional disability in comparison to young peoplewith other chronicpain conditions (Logan et al., 2013). The impact of livingwith chronic pain in adolescencecan be substantial, negatively impacting on physical and emotional functioning, peerrelationships, school engagement, and attainment (Haraldstad, Sørum, Eide, Karin, &Helseth, 2011; Simons, Sieberg, & Clarr, 2012).Chronic pain existswithin a social context (Williams&Craig, 2016),with the impact ofadolescent chronic pain extending beyond the individual to family and peers (Forgeronet al., 2010; Jaaniste, Phupps, Lang, & Champion, 2013; Jordan, Eccleston, & Osborn,2007). Individualswhoparent an adolescentwith chronic pain report low levels of health-related quality of life (Mano, Khan, Ladwig, &Weisman, 2011), restrictions in their sociallife and feelings of helplessness (Skarstein, Bergem, & Helseth, 2020), sleep disruption,(Meltzer &Moore, 2008) and elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (Eccleston,Crombez, Scotford, Clinch, & Connell, 2004). Additionally, parents report feelings ofhelplessness regarding their inability to relieve their child’s pain (Jordan et al., 2007), fear,lack of control, and believe their parenting skills are impaired (Baert et al., 2020). Parentalbehaviours play a critical role in their child’s adaptation to chronic pain and associatedfunctioning (Harrison et al., 2020). Parental responses may be a risk factor for child painand associated disability, and in turn, child pain and disability may impact parentalresponses (Palermo & Chambers, 2005).2 Danielle Cox et al.Typically, research has framed the impact of child pain on their parents in a negativeway. However, a smaller body of evidence has identified positive outcomes andfunctioning for parents. For example, one qualitative study identified that some fathers ofadolescents with chronic pain reported a sense of enhanced relational closeness withtheir adolescent after the onset of paindue to a sense of shared adversity (Jordan,Crabtree,& Eccleston, 2016). A further qualitative study identified that parents of young peopleengagedwith chronic pain treatment reported a sense of empowerment concerning theirattempts to adapt their parenting style and its observed positive impact on their child’sfunctioning (Gaughan, Logan, Sethna, & Mott, 2014). Such findings suggest theimportance of better equipping parents with the skills to manage adverse experiences,both in terms of their own functioning and that of their adolescent. One promising area isthat of resilience.The construct of resilience has been the focus of growing research attentionwithin thefield of chronic pain (Goubert & Trompetter, 2017; Sturgeon & Zautra, 2010; West,Stewart, Foster, &Usher, 2011). In this context, resilience is typically defined as a process,rather than a trait, whereby individuals adapt and lead successful lives despite exposure toadversity. Parental resilience has been defined as the ability of parents to deliver qualityparenting in the face of adverse circumstances (Gavidia-Payne, Denny, Davis, Francis, &Jackson, 2015). Parental resilience is displayed through parents’ use of their skills,personal assets, knowledge, and previous experience to adaptively respond and copewith problems that may hinder the delivery of quality parenting (Gavidia-Payne et al.,2015). The demonstration of parental resilience is central to the well-being anddevelopment of both parents and their child. Managing stress and functioning well in theface of adversity enhances parental well-being and self-efficacy which enables parents toprovide high-quality parenting. This fosters prospective resilience in children andmediates future coping responses to adversities (Gavidia-Payne et al., 2015; Weisner,2013). Promoting resilience in parents of an adolescent with chronic pain supportsparents to approach their child’s pain differently and decreases parental pain-catastrophizing and stress (Gauntlett-Gilbert, Clinch, Connell, & Rogers, 2015). Anunderstanding of how parents experience and demonstrate resilience could act as anevidence base to inform and develop paediatric chronic pain management by offering anadditional clinical focus that focuses on the family, not just the child with pain.Research in this emerging fieldmust be cognisant of current gapswithin the parentingliterature. Most studies have focussed on the maternal impact of parenting an adolescentwith chronic pain, ignoring the paternal impact despite the unique role that fathers play intheir child’s development (Flouri & Buchanan, 2003). Including fathers in research mayidentify any differences in how mothers and fathers make sense of and respond to theirchild’s pain (Brody & Simmons, 2007) and whether such perceived differences influencehow mothers and fathers perceive and demonstrate resilience in the face of managingtheir child’s pain. Also missing from the literature is a consideration of howmaternal andpaternal responses to their child’s pain may work in conjunction with each other toconsider the parental unit as a single dyad. A dyadic approachwould facilitate explorationof how parental responses and interactions impact broader family functioning andparental adaptation in the face of their child’s pain. A dearth of existing studies aroundparental resilience has adopted a nomothetic approach (Gavidia-Payne et al., 2015),preventing an idiographic detailed understanding of how parents experience anddemonstrate resilience. Parents’ verbal accounts of resilience offer a novel and potentiallyfruitful opportunity to understand this complex experience. This idiographic study aimsDyadic parenting, resilience, and adolescent chronic pain 3to meet these knowledge gaps by exploring how parental dyads experience anddemonstrate resilience in response to parenting an adolescent with CRPS.MethodDesignDyadic semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight parental dyads for thepurpose of generating rich qualitative data.ParticipantsInclusion and exclusion criteriaEligible participants were two parental figures living in the same household who wereparenting an adolescent daughter or son aged 11–25 and reported their child had beenmedically diagnosed with CRPS. ‘Parent’ refers to those who carry out significantparenting duties. Caregivers and step-parents were included, regardless of gender ormarital status. Both parentswere required to be able to converse in English and to be livingtogether and with the adolescent with CRPS on a full-time basis. The latter requirementwas important in this study to enable us to explore the unique shared experiences of bothparents in the context of them both living with the adolescent. Both parents wererequired to complete an online survey to collect basic demographic data before beingcontacted by the first author to take part in the interview.SamplingA purposive homogenous sampling strategy was adopted. Interpretative Phenomeno-logical Analysis (IPA) studies are conducted on small sample sizes because the primaryconcern is the use of an idiographic approach to provide a detailed account of individual’sexperiences (Smith, Flowers, & Larkin, 2009). Eight mother and father parental dyads (16participants) were recruited which is an ideal sample size for an in-depth IPA analysis(Smith et al., 2009).RecruitmentParticipantswere recruited to the study via social media posts, email communication, andblog posts from the study authors and pain specific charities and organizations. Furtherdetails of the participant recruitment process can be found in the procedure section, withdetails of numbers of participants recruited to the study shown in Figure 1. A total of 8parents were ineligible to participate because they were lone parents. In Figure 1,‘participant’ refers to each individual parent, for example 16 participants refer to 8parental dyads.Development of the interview scheduleA semi-structured interview schedule was developed by the first author (DC) withfeedback provided by the second (JP) and third authors (AJ). The full interview schedulecan be found in Appendix 1. The interview schedulewas developed following a reviewofthe existing literature on parenting an adolescent with chronic pain and, more broadly,4 Danielle Cox et al.parental resilience. An open-ended questioning route was adopted. The schedulecomprised 13 interview questions which followed a specific structure. Openingquestions queried the child’s pain condition, family life prior to their child’s diagnosis,and the present impact of their child’s CRPS. Key questions investigated copingmechanisms, resilience, sources of support, and lessons learned from parenting anadolescent with CRPS. Closing questions involved checking accuracy of information andwhether there was anything the participants wanted to add.ProcedureAll study procedures were approved by the relevant university’s departmental researchethics committee. All interested participants were directed to an online survey (Qualtrics,Provo, UT) which comprised an information sheet and demographic questions todetermine study eligibility. Interested participants were asked to provide informedconsent, complete demographic questions, and provide their personal contact details.Each member of the parental dyad was required to complete the survey before the firstauthor (DC) emailed them both to schedule the interview and requested their Skypeusername. Participants were interviewed by the first author (DC).Interviews were conducted with both members of the parental couple together. Theinterviews were conducted remotely through the internet-based video calling softwareSkype which offers both audio and visual communication between participants andFigure 1. Participant recruitment process.Dyadic parenting, resilience, and adolescent chronic pain 5interviewer. All participants elected to conduct the interviews whilst in their homes. Atthe start of the interview, participants were reminded about the purpose of the study andasked to verbally consent to being interviewed and for the interview to be audio-recordedusing MP3 Skype Recorder. Interviews lasted between 31 and 81 min, with a meanduration of 51 min (SD, 17 min). Participants were thanked for taking part and informedthat they would be emailed the debrief sheet and electronic £15 Amazon voucher. Thedebrief sheet provided clear contact details for the researcher in addition to specificcontact details for sources of support such as Samaritans and CRPS UK. Interviews wererecorded and transcribed verbatim by the first author. All personal identifying informationwas changed to ensure anonymity of quotations.Data analysisThe audio-recorded data were transcribed verbatim by the lead author; all spoken wordsand semantic sounds (e.g., mm-hm) were transcribed promptly after the interview andtranscripts were checked twice by the first author by listening to the audio-recordingwhilst reading the transcript to ensure they matched. Data were analysed using IPA(Smith, 1996). With a dedicated focus on idiographic exploration of participant accountsof phenomena, IPA was selected as the most suitable methodological framework for thedesign and analysis of the data. IPA has three theoretical underpinnings; phenomenology,idiography, and hermeneutics. Phenomenology aims to capture rich, in-depth statementsand the interpretative component seeks to understand the meaning of such statements.The idiographic approach is concerned with a focus on the lived experiences ofindividuals rather than generalizing to groups of individuals. IPA examines howparticipants understand and make sense of their lived experiences, through exploringthemeaning(s) that participants ascribe to experiences that are important to them (Smithet al., 2009). A key epistemological assumption of IPA is that understanding theparticipant’s experiences is a process produced by the participant and the researcher,referred to as a ‘double hermeneutic’ as the researcher tries to make sense of how theparticipant understands their own experiences (Smith, 2004). The exploratory approachof IPA suits the nature of this studywhich aimed to explore a research question that is bothnovel and under-studied (Smith, 2004). IPA has been successfully employed to study thephenomenon of chronic pain (Smith & Osborn, 2007; Snelgrove & Liossi, 2009), and inparticular, the individuals’ experiences of parenting an adolescent with chronic pain(Jordan et al., 2007).With regard to analytical processes, the authors followed specific IPA guidelinesdeveloped by Smith et al. (2009). The first author familiarized themselves with the data,analysed the language used and how it reflected the meaning that the participants gave totheir thoughts and experiences and generated initial codes and themes for each transcript.Transcripts were then compared to identify any shared patterns and the second and thirdauthors provided input into reviewing, redefining and creating the final theme via email.Trustworthiness and rigourTo establish credibility of analyses, interpretation of the transcripts was discussed duringfrequent meetings with co-authors to ensure a coherent, compelling and groundedanalyses based on the existing data. Dependability and confirmability were addressedthrough clear reporting of the study processes in the study protocol which was pre-registered on the Open Science Framework (weblink: https://osf.io/wjh3d/) and6 Danielle Cox et al.inclusion of interview schedules in this manuscript for the purposes of ensuringtransparency of the research process. Careful documentation of analytical decisions bythe main researcher using a reflective journal as part of an audit trail also addresses theissues of dependability and confirmability.ReflexivityIPA’s phenomenological and interpretative standpoint requires the researcher to engagein a reflexive process (Smith et al., 2009). The first author (DC) who conducted theinterviews and led the analysis kept a reflective journal throughout the research process.This provided the opportunity to record perceptions before and after conducting eachinterview and reflect on the researcher’s own position and relation to the research topic.Collectively, the authors considered their own position in relation to the research topic aswomen pain researchers with no personal experience of pain who have worked in thefield for over 20 years.ResultsParticipant characteristicsTable 1 shows that the dyads were similar in age, with an age range of 41–53 years. Mostparents were employed on a full-time basis. Parents reported their adolescents to be aged11–18 years and to have lived with CRPS for 1–3 years.Overview of findingsA single key theme ‘masking reality in the face of pain’ dominated the parental discourseand experience of resilience. This theme identified an incongruence between the sharedTable 1.

Whilst the display of parentalresilience was perceived to fulfil multiple functions, the most important functionsconcerned protecting the child and one’s own identity as a ‘good’ parent in relation todemonstrating socially desirable behaviours in the face of this adversity. However, toachieve this outward display of resilience, parents needed to mask their shared sufferingand distress in multiple ways. Displaying resilience enabled parents to find ways tomanage their child’s pain and to protect their child from their own distress, yet it alsocreated a sense of isolation from others who perceived the parents to be managing theirchild’s pain effectively without the need for additional support.Masking reality in the face of painAn important aspect of resilience for the parents concerned the feeling that they neededto isolate themselves from other people, except for their partner. Parents often shared afeeling of helplessness in managing their child’s condition, but typically only expressedthese feelings to their partner and chose not to seek support from family and friends. Thisis reflected in the quotation below.The majority of the people just don’t get it. . .we rely on each other because I think weunderstand what it is, and it is difficult to try to explain and share our feelings outside of ourfamily (Emily, dyad 4, mother of daughter aged 18).Emily explained how she and her husband were solely dependent on each other foremotional and practical support which was driven by their shared understanding of theirdaughter’s condition and needs. As their parenting experience was unique to them, thisdyad found it easier to distance themselves from others who lacked the understanding ofthe emotional strain attached to parenting a child with CRPS. This observation that theparents found strength in each other may have been different had the parents beeninterviewed separately where perhaps there may be less pressure or expectation toappear cohesive and dependent on each other. The display of resilience was presentedpublicly by putting on a ‘brave face’, not asking for any help or advice and reassuringfriends and family that everything is okay. This is indicated in the quotation below throughattempts to present and achieve normality.Some of the wider family have found it harder to understand than others um it’s very difficultto explain this illness to people as one day they [daughter with CRPS] could be in bed and thenext day they could be walking so people find it really difficult and it’s difficult for us toexplain it again and again so we do try to act like everything is normal, yeah, as normal aspossible (Kate, dyad 3, mother of daughter aged 11).This public display of resilience functioned to protect others, create a sense ofcalmness, and avoid having to explain their daughter’s condition which was often metwith confusion andmisunderstanding. Thiswas beneficial as it motivated parents to avoidbehaviours associated with ruminating on the situation and allowed them to find ways totry to adapt to their child’s pain. Perhaps the parents found it hard to express theirexperiences during the interview as they were used to experiencing difficulty whenexplaining it to others. Additionally, they had no prior knowledge as to whether theinterviewer had any personal experience of chronic pain and thus that shared8 Danielle Cox et al.understanding, but could make the assumption they had a level of knowledge of chronicpain. Themajority of parents did ask the interviewer at the endof the interview about theirbackground and relationship to chronic pain.Despite these benefits of appearing resilient, the outward display of resilience in theface of inward personal distress was also disadvantageous. Parents’ inability to honestlydisplay their feelings resulted in a sense of social isolation from those outside the familyunit. Many parents described how they felt that it was important and necessary to altertheir appearance to present themselves as being resilient and coping even though this didnot represent their true feelings. This was often portrayed and explained by the parentsthrough the use ofmetaphors to describe their faked facial expressions and new clothing.There’s no point crying andmoaning about it. For themost part, it works, there are days that Ido get upset about it [her child’s experience of pain], but I just try, like I say, just to carry on,paint a smile on my face and keep going (Helen, dyad 1, mother of daughter aged 14).This outward smile is incongruent with the perceived sense of helplessness andfrustration that Helen experienced on particularly challenging days. Her smile waspainted on to achieve the desired effect of illustrating that she is happy to others andperhaps to herself when she looks in the mirror. Nonetheless, her feelings of frustrationhelped support Helen to bounce back, push forwards and ‘keep going’; therefore,facilitating her expression of resilience.Although the parents frequently presented a public display of resilience, in rarecircumstances they were able to share their distress with others and the sense of reliefassociated with this was palpable. This is highlighted below by Carol when attending atreatment centre for her daughter.It’s the hardest thing um (pause) ever because you have to put on this shirt and you know thisbrave face and you have everybody saying “Oh gosh, you’re so positive” when really on theinside it is just (pause) terrible (cries) but in [name of treatment centre] it was really goodbecause Olivia (child) would go off and I was in the waiting roomwith the people with CRPSyou know similar things, and um I just cried like for 4 days and then they said “It’s fine, don’tworry about it” you knowbecause they understand and it’s hard to understand (Carol, dyad 5,mother of daughter aged 15).Here, Carol continued the metaphor of the use of clothing and a ‘brave face’ to maskher true self, something that was difficult and emotive through Carol’s tears whendescribing this. She also highlights the support she received when she allowed herself toshow her true feelings to other families living with CRPS who did have a sharedunderstanding of her experiences. The disparity between the strength of the parents’feelings of helplessness and the desire to not share their feelingswith others outside of thefamily unit who do not share this experience suggests that perceived social pressuresmayprovide a partial explanation for this incongruence between how parents feel and howthey behave. Specifically, the parentsmay have chosen to avoid displaying their feelings ofpowerlessness or vulnerability to others due to the sense of a wider perceived societalpressure to exhibit behaviours indicative of resilience and coping effectively when facingadversity. Such pressure to display resilience was perceived in their relationship withother significant individuals in the lives such as their family, friends, colleagues, and,importantly, their daughter with CRPS. Maintaining a resilient appearance to theindividuals that the parents are closest to and see every day requires substantial effort andDyadic parenting, resilience, and adolescent chronic pain 9energy. It also questions the authenticity of these relationships if they feel scared to ‘crack’and share their distresswith those individuals who form their social and support network.The parental display of resiliencewas not only driven by perceived social pressure butalso by a strong desire to protect and care for their child. For example, under the pressureto be a ‘good’ parent to her child, Mary describes how she ‘did what had to be done’ andwas willing to do anything and go the extra mile to ‘fight’ for her daughter to ensure thather daughter’s needs were being met to give her daughter the resilience that she alsoneeds. This is indicated in the excerpt below from dyad 6.She said tome anyway, she said that um, I’m getting emotional, that she (pause) she found herstrength from (crying) (Mary, dyad 6)From what? (John, dyad 6, father of daughter aged 11)(Crying) she got her strength fromwatchingme fight for her (pause) and I mean I just (pause)obviously that’s her version of it. I took you know, I did what had to be done and be thestrength and resilience is her and it’s in her now, we’re still fighting through it (Mary, dyad 6,mother of daughter aged 11).In the quotation above Mary demonstrates strength, yet her tears and heightenedemotions expose her vulnerability in making an effort to protect her daughter from hermaternal distress and give her daughter the opportunity to see her mother displayingstrength and resilience. In discussing such ‘resilient’ behaviours she describes her ‘fight’function to both show herself as a strong individual to others and importantly, as a strong‘advocate’ for her daughter. Related to this, the parents also felt the need to be bravespecifically for their child, as indicated below by Craig.Probably with me just keeping a brave face (Craig, dyad 5, father of daughter aged 15)For Craig, being ‘brave’ was an ongoing process. Maintaining a ‘brave’ face was key toconvincing his daughter with CRPS, that the challenges of living with CRPS weremanageable. This served to create a sense of calm and control over the situation for thewhole family. Craig’s need to convince his daughter that hewas resilient was salient to hisidentity as both a father and aman, as gender social norms teach and expectmen to refrainfrom showing emotional vulnerability or weakness and instead show a ‘brave face’(Chaplin, 2015).Parents also strived toprotect their daughters by creating a family environment that didnot revolve around their child’s pain as a mechanism to create a ‘normal’ familyenvironment. All parents described how they conducted themselves ‘normally’, with this‘normative’ behaviour being actively encouraged by health care professionals andtreatment providers. Specifically, health care professionals encouraged many of theparents to try to normalizeCRPSbynot focussing on it day today and instead create a senseof normality that is not defined and controlled by pain. This attempt tomaintain normalitymay have affected their public presentation of resilience to others as the parents couldhave interpreted that they should also withhold difficulty conversations from family andfriends, impacting their support systems. Avoiding talking aboutCRPSwith their daughterwas difficult for the parents as highlighted by Sally who said that herself and her husbandPaul felt that they both couldn’t share their feelings of ‘frustration’ with her.10 Danielle Cox et al.You’ve got to nurture her and almost you can’t talk aboutCRPS, you’re not supposed tofocus on it, but you have all these feelings of frustration and you can’t share themwith her(Sally, dyad 2, mother of daughter aged 12).Whilst Sally concealed her true emotions of distress from her daughter, her use of theword ‘nurture’ suggests that she wanted to care for and protect her daughter; animportant parental role. In this instance, not only is Sally striving to put her daughter first,but caring and ‘nurturing’ her daughter could also be a way of enabling her daughter todevelop resilience as she continues to grow. This contrasts the parental sense ofobligation to ‘fake’ resilience. Consequently, thebehaviour of theparents in this studywasdirectly oppositional to the behaviour that they encouraged their adolescents to adopt.The parents strived to build their child’s own resilience by encouraging them to adapt totheir condition rather than allow it to stop them from taking part in activities andsocializing. Additionally, they often discussed how their child was resilient in the face oftheir condition. The perceived need to display resilience was tied to the participants’sense of their parental identity and the desired characteristics of a ‘good’ parent that putstheir child first and protects them from distress. Emily described her shared experience of‘our resilience’with her husband as an obligation that comeswithparenthood, rather thana choice:Our resilience is I think is good, I mean we just have no choice as parents, it’s not an option(laughs). It’s not an option, you have to, what else can you do? You have to keep going (Emily,dyad 4, mother of daughter aged 18).By implication, Emily suggests that it is advantageous to display resilient behaviour,inferring that the absence of such behaviours is associated with ‘bad’, or less desirableparenting. This is particularly interesting given the clear difficulties that Carol and Craigbelow highlight in relation to the pressures of displaying behaviours that show them asstrong, happy, and resilient individuals when such behaviour directly conflicts with theirinward feelings of distress. Despite the outward appearance of ‘strength’, this resilience ismisleading. Carol andCraig acknowledge a sense of fragility and resilience as an obligationwhen there are no other options.I think to keep you know to maintain that resilience um if we crack (Carol)Yeah (Craig)Then she’s gonna see us being upset, so the amount of times you know in the middle of thenight we’ve woken up in tears um, to my friends you know I’ve been in tears, but for Olivia(daughter) it’s always been “You’re okay Olivia, we’ll get through this” so appearing resilientto her but on the inside not being resilient at all (Carol, dyad 5, mother of daughter aged 15).Yeah (Craig, dyad 5, father of daughter aged 15)This sense of fragility is shared only between parents, with their daughter explicitlyprotected from witnessing the possible ‘cracking’ of her parents’ external resilientappearance. Carol and Craig were afraid that their resilient appearance would ‘crack’ andbreak and that thiswould have negative implications on their daughter.Whilst the parentsfelt this pressure to appear resilient to their child, all of the parents described theirdaughter as already being the definition of resilience, as indicated in the quotation below.Dyadic parenting, resilience, and adolescent chronic pain 11I’d say um she is the definition of it uh Imean resilience. I’d say it’s the ability to um you knowin her case like dig deep inside and find whatever it is to um be that strength that pulls herthrough and then allows you um to continue, the resilience is in her (Mary, dyad 6, mother ofdaughter aged 16).What is evident here is that Mary does not perceive herself to be resilient, but insteadfocusses the discussion on her ‘resilient’ daughter. Congruent with other parents, Maryperceived pressure to display a resilient exterior for their child and others too. Thismay bein order to protect her child and identity as a ‘good’ parent. The irony, for all parents, isthat pretending to be resilientmay addpressure andmake it difficult to become resilient inan already difficult and challenging situation. Whilst the parents naturally felt obliged topractically adapt their day to day lives to their child’s pain, this experience was notwithout difficulty and the true inner turmoil faced by the parents in managing this andtheir external display to others was emotionally exhausting but viewed as a necessity toprotect themselves and their child and ultimately to put their child first.DiscussionThis study provided an in-depth and detailed examination of the meaning that parentaldyads ascribed to their shared experience and demonstration of resilience, in the contextof parenting an adolescentwithCRPS.One dominant theme, ‘masking reality in the face ofpain’,was generated. The themehighlights the incongruencebetween theprivate distressexperienced by the parents and their perceived need for an outward display of resiliencebehaviours. This was experienced in relation to their perceived role, duty and identity asparents. Additionally, it was guided by their perception of what constitutes as ‘good’ andsocially desirable parenting behaviour which conveys a favourable image of positiveparental behaviours including parentalwarmth, support, and adaptive coping in responseto adversities (Bornstein et al., 2014). Parenting an adolescentwith chronic painwas oftenvery distressing as parents typically felt helpless due to not being able to alleviate theirchild’s pain, which was a violation of the parenting role (Skarstein et al., 2020). Suchparental distress is a normal response to a challenging situation, highlighting theimportance of future pain research focussing on normalization of both adolescent andparental responses to pain and associated disability (Eccleston, 2011). The additionalcontext of parenting an adolescentwith a chronic conditionmayhave further shapedhowthey viewed their duties as parents and how they should conduct themselves. Theseperceived duties have been previously explored, for example, in parents of children withcancer and also reveals that parents feel obliged to be a ‘good’ parent by putting theirchild’s needs first, being the advocate for their child when making decisions about theircare and remaining at their side in the face of difficult situations and circumstances(Feudtner et al., 2015; Hinds et al., 2009).The importance of the role of the family environment in young people’s resilience andadaptation to chronic pain is reflected in the ecological resilience-risk model of paediatricpain (Cousins, Kalapurakkel, Cohen, & Simons, 2015). The model outlines theinteractions between resilience mechanisms and risk factors with a bidirectionalrelationship between the individual and the family. One prominent finding in our studythat relates to this relationship is the parental motivation to appear ‘brave’ and externalizeresilience which they believed helped to promote resilience and coping in their child.This finding highlights not only the importance of the resources that families have but alsohow they use and present this to others. The impact of the tension between what an12 Danielle Cox et al.individual displays externally versuswhat they experience internally will be an importantconsideration in future research.Of particular interest in this study was how parents made sense of and enactedresilience. Our findings identified that parents understood resilience in the context ofadapting to their child’s pain to maintain a lifestyle that was as close to ‘normal’ aspossible. Formany parents, these adaptationswere difficult and theymade the decision to‘suffer in silence’ and put on a ‘brave face’, rather than drawing upon help and supportfrom family and friends which would have facilitated their own resilience (Rosenberg &Yi-Frazier, 2016). Accommodating their child’s pain through trying to live a ‘normal’ life isresonantwith the broader resilience literaturewhich has demonstrated the importance ofcarrying onwith life in those previously or currently livingwith a long-term condition. Forexample, in an interview study, Edwards, Welsh, and Chater (2009) identified that adultsin remission for amental illness described resilience as the ability tomove forwards in life,perceiving value in how this ‘moving forwards’ could enable them to adapt to futurecircumstances and events. Additionally, West et al. (2011) found that achieving normalityand stability was associated with resilience in adults with chronic pain.Findings from our study highlighted how parents tried to hide their distress from theirchild with the aim of protecting their child and creating a calm and safe environment.Suppressing their own emotions seemed to be the optimal way to achieve this. Thesefindings highlight the importance of further extending the parental remit of paediatricchronic pain research to focus on better understanding parental emotional andbehavioural response to child pain, for the purposes of improving both child andparental functioning. Understanding the adolescent’s response and experience of living ina household in which the parents display resilience with reduced focus on the pain maylead to adolescents perceiving their experience of pain to be invalidated by parents,subsequently influencing adolescents’ responses to their pain and selected managementstrategies. This is an area worthy of further research. It is important to acknowledge thecritical role that parents play in their child’s adaptation to chronic pain (Palermo, Valrie, &Karlson, 2014) and the association betweenparental psychological distress and functionalimpairment in young people with chronic pain (Harrison et al., 2020). Furthermore,parental resilience may buffer the association between parental symptoms of depressionand child pain intensity which highlights the important interaction between resilienceand risk factors (Khu, Soltani, Neville, Schulte, & Noel, 2018).The finding that parents chose to hide their distress and struggles by ‘painting a smileon my face and keep going’ is of importance in relation to a recent research studyidentifying that even when mothers try to mask and hide feelings of stress, they can stillpass these feelings on to their child (Waters, Karnilowicz, West, & Mendes, 2020),highlighting the importance of the parental response. This effect did not apply to fathersin the study, perhaps due to gender differences in responses to stress. In fact, previousresearch has revealed differences between the maternal and paternal experience ofparenting a child with a long-term condition (Swallow, Lambert, Santacroce, &Macfayden, 2011). In comparison to the wider literature, our study deliberately did notseek to compare maternal and paternal responses as its aim was to capture the parentalcouple’s shared experiences of resilience. Exploration of such gender differences inrelation to different aspects of the relationship between parent and adolescent andbetween parents would be a fruitful area for future study.In two-partner households, parenthood, even if not equally balanced betweenmothers and fathers, is a shared responsibility and experience. In our study, the parentsdiscussed their experiences of resilience as a parental unit rather than as individuals.Dyadic parenting, resilience, and adolescent chronic pain 13Congruent with previous research, our findings highlighted they placed importance onworking as a team and valued the support that they received from their partnerwho had ashared understanding of the difficulties and challenges they faced (West et al., 2011).These consistent findings highlight a gap in the literature for future research to exploreresilience in lone parents who do not have support from a partner and therefore mayrequire more tailored clinical support. Similarly, future research could helpfully focus onstudying other configurations of parental relationships that move beyond the traditionalbiological mother–father dyadic relationships.Strengths, limitations, and implicationsA strength of the current study is that the parents were directly asked what the termresilience meant to them, rather than being presented with an existing empirically ortheoretically informed definition (Rosenberg, Starks, & Jones, 2014). Exploring andclarifying themeaning of resilience in this way is particularly beneficial for IPA research. Ashared understanding of the term is an important part of interpreting how the parentsmade sense of their lived experiences. Thus, future resilience research should also aim toclarify what the term resilience means to their participants in terms of how theyunderstand and embody it.It is important to highlight that, conforming to the requirements of IPA, the samplecomprised a homogenous sample of eight couples parenting an adolescent with CRPS.Parents of adolescentswith other chronic pain conditionsmay have different experiencesof resilience, particularly considering that paediatric CRPS is oftenmore severe than otherpain conditions (Logan et al., 2013). Nonetheless, the aim of the present study was tounderstand the experiences of a specific sample in a specific context, rather than torepresent the experiences of all parents of an adolescent with chronic pain.Most parental research focuses on the experience of themother. This study provided anovel methodological approach by interviewing both mothers and fathers together toexplore their shared experience of resilience. It could have been beneficial to additionallyinterview each parent separately to explore potential differences in disclosure andconsider gender differences in reported parenting experiences. This is worthy ofinvestigation in future research.There were differences between the parent dyads. Whilst all parents were White, fiveout of the eight couples lived in the UK,whilst three couples lived in the USA. Thereweregeographical differences in terms of accessing health care, finance, and insurance relatedto medical treatment and in the treatment available. It would be interesting for futureresearch to further explore the experiences of parents living specifically in the USAwith adetailed focus on the relationship between finances, other resources and resilience.The sample also consisted solely of parents of an adolescent daughter with CRPS.Whilst unintentional, this was not wholly unsurprising given that paediatric CRPS is moreprevalent in adolescent girls (deMos et al., 2007; Low et al., 2007). It would be interestingfor future research to actively recruit parents of a sonwithCRPS to explore any differencesin biases or parenting behaviour in response to parenting a son or daughter with CRPS.Current research in populations without chronic pain has found differences in parentalratings of pain between sons and daughters undertaking a cold pressor pain task wherebyfathers gave their sons higher pain ratings than fathers of a daughter despite comparablefacial expressions of pain (Moon et al., 2008). In this study, no differences were found formothers’ ratings of pain between child genders. This may suggest that fathers may expect14 Danielle Cox et al.sons to display less pain than they are experiencing to conform with societies idealmasculinized stereotypes of males responding less to pain.With regard to clinical implications, how parents understood resilience is key toconsider here. Specifically, when parentswere askedwhat resiliencemeant to them, theydescribed it not only in relation to their own experiences, but their experiences as afamily. A strength-based approach to clinical interventions and treatment could help tosupport the whole family. Promoting and sustaining further positive development forfamilies in which a member experiences chronic pain has been proposed to be moreeffective than interventions which focus on the shared difficulties faced by the family(Foster, 2010; Usher, Jackson, & O’Brien, 2005). A family resilience strength-basedapproachwould enable health care professionals to identify and focus on the strengths ofthe family, rather than focussing on their problems. Since our research has found thatparents tend to shield their distress from others including their child, health careprofessionals should be encouraged to incorporate parent-only sessions as an integral partof paediatric chronic pain treatment where parents can be encouraged to identify andshare any challenging feelings regarding a perceived need to display externalizedresilience in a safe and open environment. Additionally, helping the family to recognizetheir strengths and enhance their resilience could help them to use their skills to confrontfuture crises from apositive perspective (Walsh, 2006). A strength-based approach shouldnot only be limited to familieswho are not copingwell, but should also be used to supportfamilies who are coping well, as a preventative measure for responses to future crises(Zautra, Johnson, & Davis, 2005).ConclusionThis study adds to the growing literature on the parental experiences of parenting anadolescent with chronic pain and adds a novel insight into how parents experienceresilience in the context of parenting an adolescent with CRPS, particularly by focussingon the shared experiences of both mothers and fathers. The findings highlight the benefitof promoting parental resilience through strength-based approaches. This may help topromote positive functioning within the whole family and help the adolescent to managetheir pain, improve their pain outcomes, and reduce parental distress.AcknowledgementsThe authors would like to thank all of the participants who took part in this study and the paincharities and organizations who assisted in the recruitment process.Conflicts of interestAll authors declare no conflict of interest.Data availability statementResearch data are not shared as consent to do sowas not gainedwhen the data were collected.Dyadic parenting, resilience, and adolescent chronic pain 15ReferencesBaert, F., McParland, J., Miller, M.
