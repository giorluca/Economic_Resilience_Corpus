Shutdowns caused many firmsto entirely cease operations for a time.Now, they are grappling with plummetingdemand as a result of risingunemployment and uncertainty, on top ofsupply chain difficulties and uncertaintyas to financing resources.Bad Timing for a Global CrisisAlthough there is no “good” time for apandemic to strike, business conditions in2020 were already a little shaky prior tothe outbreak. At the beginning of theyear, the global economy had justfinished its weakest year since the GreatRecession, global trade was turning sour,trade finance had become more restrictedand continued uncertainty from the U.S.-China trade war weighed on businesseseverywhere.If the outlook was stormy at the beginningof the year, it’s now outright bleak. Atradius economists are now forecasting that globaltrade will decrease approximately 15 percent in 2020, while global GDP will declineabout 5 percent. The U.S. will perform below average, with a 6.1 percent decrease inGDP – largely due to its lag in controlling the virus and subsequent record high innumber of COVID-19 cases, in addition to soaring unemployment as well as pressure onincomes, leading to a drop in consumption.Will Government Intervention Be Enough?Governments and central banks the world over have enacted measures to counteract thepandemic’s economic devastation. Early in the crisis, for instance, the European CentralBank put in place a Long Term Refinancing Operations III program, while the U.S.Federal Reserve increased quantitative easing.Countries have also put together aid packages, such as the U.S. CARES Act and anumber of packages from individual EU economies and the UK. Similarly, China isproviding tax relief, state-backed credit guaranteed, and delayed loan and interestpayments. Altogether, global government stimulus measures amount to approximately 9percent of global GDP, or around $7.8 trillion.But will this be enough? Atradius economists suggest not – not unless countries alsoenact vigorous policies to revitalize the economy at every level. The EU Pandemic Fundprovides a good example: the $750 billion initiative will bestow loans and grants to theareas and sectors hardest hit by the pandemic, allowing for a more even recovery rateacross the entire EU.Although stimulus measures are necessary, soaring government debt levels are alsocause for concern – even before the outbreak, many countries had worryingly high debtAn Economic Recovery From COVID-19 in 2021 Is Possible – But Massive Uncertainty Remains - Global Trade Magazinehttps://www.globaltrademag.com/an-economic-recovery-from-covid-19-in-2021-is-possible-but-massive-uncertainty-remains/[21-7-2022 14:21:02]Share this:levels. The most recent baseline scenario from Atradius economists has the U.S. federalbudget deficit, as a proportion of GDP, increasing by more than 10 percentage points thisyear. The UK will fare even worse, seeing a 13 percentage point increase in deficitgrowth rate. China and India are the only major economies likely to maintain moderatedebt ratios through the pandemic.All that said, low interest rates will likely stick around through the end of 2021 at least –this should help offset some of the concerns over high government debt levels.Moreover, central banks like the Fed and ECB will continue purchasing governmentbonds, suppressing any financial market stress.What’s Next?While the global economy is under undue strain at the moment, Atradius economistspredict a recovery could begin as early as this year, continuing into 2021. Our baselinescenario has global GDP rebounding by 5.7 percent in 2021, with the U.S. coming in justunder that, with GDP growth of 4.2 percent.This scenario, however, is shrouded in uncertainty and hinges on a few keyassumptions:-That researchers are able to develop a successful vaccine in the near-term-That lockdowns will be limited throughout the remainder of the outbreak-That oil prices will remain low-That the U.S.-China trade war will remain at a standstill-That the rise in financing cost for firms, if any, remains limitedShould these assumptions not play out, the global economic recession could be muchworse than anticipated – contraction rates could be twice as damaging as those currentlypredicted, with global GDP contracting 12.2 percent in 2020 and U.S. GDP seeing a 7.9percent drop. Recovering from a contraction of this size would be a slow, painfulprocess, although we would expect 2021 to see similar growth rates.___________________________________________________________________John Lorié is chief economist with Atradius Economic Research.
