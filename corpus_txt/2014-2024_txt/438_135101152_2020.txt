Photovoltaic panelsare mainly made up of high-quality solar glass (70–90%), but also metals are present in the frames (Al),the cell (Si), and metallic contacts (Cu and Ag). According to the panel composition, about $72 per100 kg of panels can be recovered by entirely recycling the panel metal content. The PhotoLife processfor the treatment of end-of-life photovoltaic panels was demonstrated at pilot scale to recycle highvalue glass, Al and Cu scraps. A process upgrade is here reported allowing for polymer separationand Ag and Si recycling. By this advanced PhotoLife process, 82% recycling rate, 94% recovery rate,and 75% recoverable value were attained. Simulations demonstrated the economic feasibility of theprocess at processing capacity of 30,000 metric ton/y of end-of-life photovoltaic panels.Keywords: end of life photovoltaic panels; polymers recycling; metals recycling; process simulation;SuperPro Designer1. IntroductionOne of the major challenges that humanity is facing is to promote the transition from traditionalfossil fuels to long-term sustainable energies [1]. In recent decades, photovoltaic (PV) technology hasbecome a competitive technological alternative allowing to reach appreciable power production byconversion of solar energy into electricity [2].Si-crystalline photovoltaic panels (PVPs) currently represent the dominating technology [3]covering 90% of the global market share [4]. The application of alternative PV technologies, such as thethin-film Cd-Te and CIGS panels, is limited by the application of toxic metals (Cd in Cd-Te) and rareelements (In and Ga in CIGS) [5], which contributes to consolidate the dominating market position ofthe Si based panels [3].Taking into consideration the PVPs market growth recorded over the past decades [6],a progressively increasing annual flux of the end-of-life (EOL) PVPs is foreseen. Specifically, it ispredicted that about 8 and 78 million EOL-PVPs tons could be generated within 2030 and 2050,respectively [7].Energies 2020, 13, 6690; doi:10.3390/en13246690 www.mdpi.com/journal/energiesEnergies 2020, 13, 6690 2 of 17Recycling this huge flux of EOL-PVPs is indispensable to prevent that harmful elements containedin the panels, such as heavy metals, could be dispersed into the environment [8]. To this purpose,EU included EOL-PVPs in the class of the wastes of electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) [9],and established minimum targets for their collection (65%), recycling (80%), and recovery (85%) startingfrom August 2018 (previous process targets were 70% for recycling and 80% for recovery).In addition to significant environmental benefits, the value of recycling also lies in the recoveryof secondary raw materials [10]. Hence, in addition to the compliance with relevant regulations,the appropriate EOL-PVPs management may offer a further sustainable solution to raw materials supply.As a consequence, the EOL-PVPs treatment became an extensively studied topic, generally addressedthrough the life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology [11–16].Considering that main recycling targets in a Si-crystalline PVP are glass, photovoltaic cellsand metals, including panel frames (Al) and current collectors (Cu and Ag) [17], the following twoobservations should be taken into account: (i) the aluminum frame and front glass represent morethan 80% of the PVP total weight and (ii) 80% of the overall PVP value is associated to the metalsused in PV cell and electric contacts (mainly Si, Cu, and Ag). This means that in order to guaranteethe economic sustainability of the recycling process, metals of cell and contacts need to be recycledtogether with glass and frames (Figure 1). On the other hand, strategies focused solely on cell recoverycannot guarantee the minimum recycling targets set by regulations.Energies 2020, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 17  predicted that about 8 and 78 million EOL-PVPs tons could be generated within 2030 and 2050, respectively [7]. Recycling this huge flux of EOL-PVPs is indispensable to prevent that harmful elements contained in the panels, such as heavy metals, could be dispersed into the environment [8].

As a consequence, the EOL-PVPs treatment became an extensively studied topic, generally addressed through the life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology [11–16]. Considering that main recycling targets in a Si-crystalline PVP are glass, photovoltaic cells and metals, including panel frames (Al) and current collectors (Cu and Ag) [17], the following two observations should be taken into account: (i) the aluminum frame and front glass represent more than 80% of the PVP total weight and (ii) 80% of the overall PVP value is associated to the metals used in PV cell and electric contacts (mainly Si, Cu, and Ag). This means that in order to guarantee the economic sustainability of the recycling process, metals of cell and contacts need to be recycled together with glass and frames (Figure 1). On the other hand, strategies focused solely on cell recovery cannot guarantee the minimum recycling targets set by regulations. A literature survey highlights that the difficulties encountered in the degradation of the encapsulant polymer (typically polyethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA)) represent a major obstacle to the separation of the EOL-PVP components and thus to the efficient recovery of different valuable fractions [5].  Figure 1. Exploded diagram representing the main components of a EOL-PVP: Al frame (10%), glass (69–75%), polymers (7–15%), PV cell (3%), and metallic filaments (1%) [5,17,18]. The most common recycling methods implemented at pilot and industrial scale rely on mechanical treatments (i.e., dismantling, crushing, and sieving) to achieve the separation of the different PVP components and their concentration in specific size fractions. Typical examples of this approach include the recycling processes proposed by the French environmental services provider Veolia [19], and by the Italian company Nike* S.r.l. [20]. However, these processes are generally defined as ‘downcycling’ because they can meet the requirements of the EU directive by recovering only low-value fractions (e.g., impure fine-sized glass fractions [17]). This is mainly caused by the fine milling operations required to separate the various EOL-PVPs components from the encapsulant Fig re 1.

This is mainly caused by the fine millingoperations required to separate the various EOL-PVPs components from the encapsulant (EVA).Indeed, while enabling the separation of the different EOL-PVP components, these operations are alsoresponsible for the contamination of the separated components by the EVA. This negatively affects theEnergies 2020, 13, 6690 3 of 17economic sustainability of the recycling process by making it possible to recover only low-value impureglass fractions. In order to overcome this limitation, the EU Commission settled specific priorities topromote high-quality recovery operations [21] and founded research and development projects aimingat higher-value material recovery [22].Some results obtained with this approach include the technologies developed by the Italiancompany SASIL [23] and by the German Geltz Umwelt-Technologie [24]. Both these technologiesare based, again, on mechanical operation but they include a preliminary degradation of the plasticcomponents (i.e., encapsulant and backsheet polymers) by pyrolysis. However, even though facilitatingthe separation of the PV cell from the encapsulant polymer, this thermal degradation is responsiblefor the generation of toxic gaseous emissions, mainly due to the fluoride compounds contained inthe Tedlar® backsheet (commercial name for Polyvinyl Fluoride based film [25]), which negativelyinfluences the overall environmental impact of the recycling process [26].A technological solution allowing for the separation of the PV cell, alternative to pyrolysis,is the solvent treatment. Specifically, by virtue of a swelling/dissolution mechanism, the EVA ispartly solubilized in the solvent, thereby facilitating the separation of the various PVP components.This method was generally implemented by dipping the entire panel in the solvent bath in absenceof solvent agitation, which yielded inefficient mass transfer and thus imposed long treatmenttimes [27–29]. For instance, Doi et al. tested different solvents (i.e., lacquer thinner, toluene, acetone,petroleum benzene, ethanol, methyl ethyl ketone, isopropanol, methyl isobutyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran,trichloroethylene, ethylene glycol, glycerine) at 80 ◦C and reported that the best separation performanceswere obtained by using trichloroethylene in a 10-day treatment [27]. Prado et al. obtained insteadthe Cell detachment at room temperature by using isopropanol for 2 days [28]. Yan et al. [29],proposed the separation of the various layers constituting the EOL-PVP through a hydrothermal routein KOH-ethanol solution. Nevertheless, the use of these green solutions resulted always in glassfraction still containing EVA residues (low purity glass) [29]. Despite these possible environmentalbenefits, the solvent treatment remains scarcely implemented due to the slower kinetics with respect tothe thermal treatment [27].Considering that glass and Al are the main component of the panels (79–85%), boosting theeconomic performances and guaranteeing the minimum targets set by regulation require effectivestrategies oriented toward high purity glass recovery, as well as the recovery of further valuablefractions (e.g., metals contained in the PV cell).In the previous works by this research group, different approaches for the treatment of EOL-PVPswere investigated [17,30–32]. These studies evidenced that a solvent treatment with cyclohexane canallow effectively recovering a high value glass fraction from crushed PVPs [17]. The possibility toeffectively recover impurity-free large sized glass separated from metal contacts and polymeric fraction(including Tedlar®, EVA, and PV cell fragments) was demonstrated at pilot scale during the PhotoLifeproject [33]. During the pilot scale demonstration, mechanical and solvent treatment were performedallowing for the recovery of Al frames, high-value glass and metallic contacts, while polymeric fractionsglued to cell elements (Ag and Si) were collected as a solid mixture requiring further refining.ObjectivesThe main objective of this work is assessing the technical and economic feasibility of an upgradedrecycling process including the refining of the polymeric-cell mixture. This process, hereafter referred toas ‘advanced PhotoLife process’, was simulated based on preliminary data derived by lab scale researchactivities. The process allows for the separation of the polymer fractions and for the recovery of thesilver and silicon fractions (Ag and Si) contained in the PV cell. Mass and energy balances are reportedand process simulations are analyzed to elaborate a preliminary techno-economic assessment. In thisframework, a comparison between the Advanced PhotoLife process and the originally developedPhotoLife process is discussed.Energies 2020, 13, 6690 4 of 17To the best of our knowledge, recycling strategies allowing the recovery of polymeric fractionshave not been reported yet. In fact, they are generally not even considered for recycling [10,27].Accordingly, process simulations reported here can allow quantifying the economic and environmentalbenefits that can be derived by the recovery and recycling of these additional materials as secondaryraw materials.2.

Solvent Treatment at Pilot Scale in the PhotoLife ProcessThe coarse fraction was further treated in a second prototype using the solvent to detach thedifferent layers glued together in PVP—namely glass, EVA, Tedlar®, metal tabbing, and cell material.This prototype was placed inside a second mobile container to allow operation in different locationsand control the working area against possible risks due to the use highly flammable hydrocarbonssuch as the cyclohexane. The container is divided into two isolated zones. The first one (Figure 2D)contains the reagent tanks along with the integrated unit for performing both panel detachment andcomponent separation by sieving and gravimetric separation. The second zone (Figure 2E) containsthe control room, the boiler with its hot water circuit, and the fan.2.3. Polymers Separation and Metal Recycling in the Advanced PhotoLife ProcessThe following EOL Photovoltaic panels were used in the present work: Si-mono (TOPCO SolarModule, TOPCO-230S6; year of manufacturing: 2011) and Si-polycrystalline (Sun Earth,TPB156X156-60-P 240; year of manufacturing: 2012). According to the PhotoloLife process,the EOL-PVPs were manually disassembled to separate the junction box and to recover the Alframes. The panels were then crushed and sieved at pilot scale, as described above. The coarse fractionfrom sieving was treated with the solvent at lab scale. The solvent treatment was performed at 70 ◦Cfor 2 h in a jacketed cell reactor (250 mL) by using 10 g of crushed material with 1:6 solid/solvent ratio.The stirring was guaranteed by a mechanical stirrer (ArgoLab AM40-D PRO) set approximately at100 rpm.After the solvent treatment, in the basic PhotoLife (Figure 3), the solvent was recovered byfiltration and distillation, while the following two solid fractions were recovered by a gravimetricseparation in water: glass and metallic filaments accumulated at bottom of the reactor filled with water,while polymers (EVA and Tedlar®) with glued PV cell fragments accumulated at the top, i.e., over thefree surface of water.Energies 2020, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 17  The coarse fraction was further treated in a second prototype using the solvent to detach the different layers glued together in PVP—namely glass, EVA, Tedlar®, metal tabbing, and cell material.

Polymers Separation and Metal Recycli g in the Advanced PhotoLife Process The following EOL Photovoltaic panels were used in the present work: Si-mono (TOPCO Solar Module, TOPCO-230S6; year of manufacturing: 2011) and Si-polycrystalline (Sun Earth, TPB156X156-60-P 240; year of manufacturing: 2012). According to the PhotoloLife process, the EOL-PVPs were manually disass mbled to separate the junction box and to recover he Al frames. Th  panels were the  crushed and sieved at pilot scale, as described above. The co rse fraction from s eving was treated with the solvent at lab scale. The solvent treatment was performed at 70 °C for 2 h in a jacketed cell reactor (250 mL) by using 10 g of crushed material with 1:6 solid/solvent ratio. The stirring was guaranteed by a mechanical stirrer (ArgoLab AM40-D PRO) set approximately at 100 rpm. After the solvent treatment, in the basic PhotoLife (Figure 3), the solvent was recovered by filtration and distillation, while the following two solid fractions were recovered by a gravimetric separation in water: glass and metallic filaments accumulated at bottom of the reactor filled with water, while polymers (EVA and Tedlar®) with glued PV cell fragments accumulated at the top, i.e., over the free surface of water.  Figure 3. Block diagram of the PhotoLife process: EOL PVP were manually dismantled for removing junction boxes and Al frames; panels were crushed and sieved; coarse fraction was treated by solvent and a gravimetric separation was performed to separate glass and metallic filaments from polymeric residue. Figure 3. Block diagram of the PhotoLife process: EOL PVP were manually dismantled for removingjunction boxes and Al frames; panels were crushed and sieved; coarse fraction was treated by solvent anda gravimetric separation was performed to separate glass and metallic filaments from polymeric residue.Energies 2020, 13, 6690 6 of 17In the advanced PhotoLife process (Figure 5), the suspension in cyclohexane resulting from thesolvent treatment was filtered by employing a wide mesh sieve (7 mm). In the filtration, the separatedTedlar® fraction was retained in the over-sieve while the under-sieve was composed of cyclohexane,glass, metal contacts and EVA residues (containing the PV cell). The composed under-sieve wasthen fed to the gravimetric separation and distillation unit. In this unit, a preliminary gravimetricseparation (solid/liquid ratio 1:50) enabled the separation of glass from the remaining components.Once the glass was separated, a distillation for the recovery and purification of the solvent wascarried out under magnetic stirring within the same reactor at 82 ◦C. The EVA residues containingthe PV cell fragments recovered after the distillation were then thermally treated in a muffle furnace(Nabertherm B410, Tmax 1100 ◦C, 1.2 kW) at 650 ◦C for 4 h. This operation promoted the polymerdegradation/decomposition. The resulting ashes containing the cell residues were recovered andtreated by leaching to promote the metals extraction. The leaching tests were carried out in a 250 mLjacketed cell reactor kept at 60 ◦C and magnetically stirred. HNO3 1.5 M (65%, Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA)was employed as leaching agent with a solid to liquid ratio of 30 mL/g for 2 h. The leach liquor wasthen filtered and analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS, contrAA® 300-AnalytikJena AG, Xenon short arc lamp; flame atomizer fed with a mixture of C2H2 and air) to assess the metalconcentrations. Calibration curves of the investigated metals were performed utilizing a multi-standardsolution (Merk Millipore 1000 mg/L HNO3 sol.). According to a selected wavelength, each metal wasdetermined in three replicates for each measurement. The total metal content in the solid sampleswas determined by two sequential extraction steps using HNO3 65% as leaching agent in the sameexperimental conditions as described above.2.4. Process SimulationsThe process was simulated in a mixed batch-continuous mode using SuperPro Designer(Intelligen, Inc., Koch Plains, NJ, USA). The manual removal of the aluminum frames from thephotovoltaic panels as well as the evaporation of the cyclohexane were simulated as continuousoperations. The other physical and hydrometallurgical operations were modeled in batch. Two processoptions were simulated, a low recycling volume process (LRVP) based on a throughput of 3000 metrictons per year (t/y) of EOL-PVPs, and a high recycling volume process (HRVP) treating 30,000 t/yof EOL-PVPs.Mass balances for mechanical treatment from pilot scale were used for shredding and sievingoperations [34], while experimental results obtained at lab scale were used to model the solventtreatment, polymer separation, and silver leaching. The recovery of silver was simulated based onexperimental conditions reported in the scientific literature [35].3. Results and Discussion3.1. PhotoLife ProcessThe PhotoLife process is described in the block diagram reported in Figure 3. Further detailsabout the operating conditions are reported elsewhere [17].The process includes the manual dismantling of the Al frame followed by shredding to produce atarget coarse fraction (>3 mm) as well as residual intermediate and fine fractions. The coarse fraction isfurther treated by organic solvents, thus resulting in high quality glass (>3 mm), metallic filamentsmade of copper, and a polymeric residue containing the PVP back sheet (mainly of Tedlar®), and theEVA encapsulant still glued to the Si cell fragments (Figure 4).Energies 2020, 13, 6690 7 of 17Energies 2020, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 17  Table 1 reports the mass balances for the different fractions obtained in the PhotoLife process. According to the operation described and the mass balances elaborated during the PhotoLife project, the recycling rate was estimated as reported in Table 2. In the PhotoLife project, the thermal treatment of plastic residue was not evaluated because, without preliminary separation of Tedlar® from EVA, such an operation is not feasible. In fact, Tedlar® contains fluoride, which can release toxic HF gas emissions during thermal valorization. For this reason, the recovery rate for the PhotoLife process is equal to the recycling rate (Table 2).  Figure 4.

Considering the main components reported in Table 3 and their market prices (https://www.capitalscrapmetal.com/prices/; https://www.dailymetalprice.com), it is found that large part of the maximum recoverable value is associated to the silver fraction contained in the PVP wastes of the PhotoLife recycling route. Accordingly, the PhotoLife process allows for only 30% Figure 4. Recovered fractions from solvent treatment operations: solar grade glass (A), metallic filaments(B), and polymeric residue (C).The Al from frames, the high quality glass and the metallic filaments can be directly recycledas they are, yielding the first revenue of the PhotoLife process [33].

Advanced PhotoLife ProcessAccording to the illustrated analysis, the process was implemented to improve the recycling andrecovery targets by:- Separating the different polymers in the polymeric residue- Recycling the Tedlar® backsheet- Thermally treating the EVA residues- Recycling the Ag and Si from the ashesThe additional unit operations required to perform this process are described in Figure 5.The process includes the separation of Tedlar® by sieving, followed by the gravimetric separation inwater of EVA residue (overflow) and glass (downflow).

Advanced PhotoLife Process According to the illustrated analysis, the process was implemented to improve the recycling and recovery targets by: - Separating the different polymers in the polymeric residue - Recycling the Tedlar® backsheet - Thermally treating the EVA residues - Recycling the Ag and Si from the ashes The additional unit operations required to perform this process are described in Figure 5. The process includes the separation of Tedlar® by sieving, followed by the gravimetric separation in water of EVA residue (overflow) and glass (downflow). The EVA residue containing the Si cell fragments and Ag from the printed contacts is then thermally treated to burn the EVA. Hydrometallurgical treatment of the residual ashes is finally performed to recover Ag and Si.  Figure 5. Block diagram of the advanced PhotoLife process. The mass balances of the Advanced PhotoLife process are reported in Table 4.   Figure 5. Block diagram of the advanced PhotoLife process.Reported results indicates that, as compared to the original PhotoLife process, the advancedPhotoLife process allows for a significant improvement in both the recycling and the recovery rate.This leads to a significant increase in the recovered value, which reaches 75% of maximum theoreticalvalue (Table 5). This increase in the recovered value is mainly due to the increased recovery of theAg panel fraction, 90% of this latter fraction is contained in the ashes fed to the hydrometallurgicaltreatment and can thus effectively recovered through the proposed process scheme.Table 5.

Process SimulationsProcess simulations were performed for the advanced PhotoLife process at two potentialities(3000 and 30,000 t/y). For both these options, the batch duration was set as 5.5 h with a cycle time(time between two subsequent batches) of 4.65 h. It is important to remark that this time doesnot correspond to the minimum cycle time, which would be instead as low as 2.17 h based on thelongest operation (process bottleneck) of water-cyclohexane density separation (total time: 2.17 h).The cycle time was set as 4.65 based on the assumption to conduct five batches per day for a total of330 days. The concept of performing five batches per day is associated with the idea of a recyclingplant working on two 8-h shifts. Based on these assumptions, the increase in recycling volume fromEnergies 2020, 13, 6690 10 of 173000 to 30,000 t/y would be ensured by the same number of batches per year with larger throughputsper batch, thus larger equipment and more labor required. In the simulation, the duration of thebatch cycle was maintained the same despite the tenfold increase in process throughputs. However,the labor required to implement the process was increased to account for the larger number of operatorsassociated with the operation of EOL-PVPs reception, storage, manual dismantling, as well as materialtransfer between operations.As for the equipment size and cycle time, the downstream hydrometallurgical section of the processrequired special consideration. For this section, the cycle time between two batches was set considerablyhigher than the upstream batch section, based on the assumption that the hydrometallurgical sectionwould process the materials generated by multiple batches of the upstream process. In particular,for the process that recycles 30,000 t/y, the cycle time in the hydrometallurgical section was set as 24 h.This means that the hydrometallurgical section in this process would treat altogether the materialgenerated in 1 day by five batches of the upstream process. In contrast, this cycle time for the LRVPwas set as 240 h. Given the 10 times lower throughputs in the LVRP, the 10-fold increase in this cycletime implies that each hydrometallurgical batch treats the same amount of material. This choiceis due to the consideration that the equipment required to treat the amount of material fed to thehydrometallurgical section (about 3% of the EOL-PVPs) would be too small and non-optimal giventhe non-linear increase in equipment cost and labor required to treat increased amount of material.In other words, treating lower amounts of materials more frequently (higher number of batches) wasconsidered as less efficient than treating the same total amount per year with a lower frequency but inlarger batches.The net profit value was calculated at an interest rate of 0.5% over a project lifetime of 15 yearsthat includes a plant construction period of 30 months and a startup period of 4 months. The cash-flowanalysis was also conducted under the assumption of an inflation rate of 1%, an income tax of40% and a depreciation time of 7 years. Such a depreciation time was set based on an overall plantdepreciation coefficient of 15%. Such a coefficient value was adopted based on current Italian legislation(Ministerial Decree 31 December 1988) that sets as 10% the depreciation coefficient for large mechanicalmachines, at 12% the one for electricity generation plants, engines and pumps, and at 17.5% the one forchemical equipment within the metallurgy industry.A comparison between the economic outputs of the two processes is listed in Table 6 evidencingthat the advanced Photolife process is economically feasible only treating 30,000 t/y.Table 6.

It is evident that the10-fold increase in the recycling volumes results in a linear increase in process revenues from about3 M$/y to 30 M$/y. At the same time, the capital investment increases only by 2 times, from about 5to 10 M$, thus contributing to a higher return on the investment. Such an increase in total capitalinvestment is due to (i) the non-linear relationship between equipment cost and size, which is knownto follow a power law with exponent around 0.5–0.6 [36,37], and (ii) the hydrometallurgical sectionsized for the same throughput but working only part of the time (1/10).Table 6 also denotes a fourfold increase in operating costs despite the 10 times higher throughputby scaling-up from LRVP to HRVP.

Figure 6. Operating cost breakdown for 3000 (a) and 30,000 (b) t/y simulations. The lower impact of the labor cost in the HRVP is associated with the increase in labor costs which increase nonlinearly with increasing the throughput. Indeed, the total labor cost comprises a component that is linearly proportional to the throughput and a component that increases only slightly, i.e., less than proportionally, with it. The first one is for instance associated with the manual work required for the manual removal of the aluminum frames from the EOL PVPs. The second one is instead the labor associated with the physical and chemical/hydrometallurgical operations, which was assumed to increase to a lower extent with the process throughput (i.e., filter-presses and reactors might require only 1 or 2 more operators despite the 10-fold increase in recycling volume). Improved understanding of the relationship between labor and process economy can be obtained by analyzing the labor cost breakdown (Figure 7). Figure 7 displays through labels the amount of labor-hours per year associated with each process section, evidencing that the largest portion of labor cost is associated with the manual dismantling of the aluminum frames. Figure 7 also evidences that the total amount of labor-hours per year required to run the process are about 88,000 and 299,000 for the LRVP and HRVP, respectively. For the LRVP, this corresponds to have on-site about 17 people at any time. For the HRVP, the same consideration leads to a total of 56 people present on the plant during each shift, which might be overestimated. However, the fact that the labor for the latest option might have been overestimated represents further corroborates the conclusion that the HRVP is economically feasible. It must be also remarked that the simulations were performed under the assumption of a high recycling rate (99%) of cyclohexane and water. Attaining this recycling rate for water and solvent is essential to minimize the costs for material consumption and waste disposal and thus enforce the economic feasibility in the HRVP. r ti t re l er i ct f t e l r c st i t e is ss ci te it t e i cre se i l r c stsic i cre se li e rl it increasing the throughput.

It must be remarked that EOL-PVPs were not considered as raw materials in the simulation but as revenues. This choice can be justified by considering that the recyclers receive from the community/collectors/PVP producers a fee to sustain the economy of the recycling process. This fee is usually paid by PVP consumers by charging with an overprice of about 10 $/PVP the cost for the purchase and installation of PVPs. Since the average PVP weight is around 20 kg/PVP, such fee ultimately translates into a gross income contribution for recyclers of about 0.5 $/kg. Table 7.

DiscussionThe technical feasibility of the PhotoLife process was demonstrated at pilot scale. This processallows recovering high-value solar glass and Al and Cu scraps with 75% recovery rate, thus fulfillingtargets set by the EU Directive (70% until 2018 now increased to 80%).On the other hand, the PhotoLife process did not include any material recovery from a residualfraction composed of the panel polymers (EVA and Tedlar®) and of the cell components. In thislatter fraction, it is concentrated about 90% of the whole Ag panel content, which account for mostof the panel recoverable value. Accordingly, by excluding metal recovery from this residual fraction,the Photolife process delivered secondary raw materials (high quality glass, Al and Cu) covering only30% of the PVP recoverable value.Preliminary lab scale tests were performed demonstrating the possibility to separate the polymericcomponents (EVA and Tedlar®) and to recycle the metals found in the cell fragments (Ag and Si),thereby improving the process performances. The proposed process solution includes the physicalseparation of the Tedlar® backsheet materials followed by the thermal decomposition of EVA.Ag and Si can be then recovered by hydrometallurgical treatment of the ashes left after EVA thermaltreatment. This process can increase both the recycling rate (82%) and the recovered value (75% ofthe panel recoverable value), giving at the same time the possibility to produce an excess of energy(from EVA combustion) needed for other process operations such as solvent treatment and leaching(advanced Photolife process material recovery rate is 94%, thus exceeding the EU target that is 85%).Process simulations at two feed rates (Table 6) denoted that the advanced PhotoLife process iseconomically feasible only treating 30,000 t/y of EOL PVP. This is due mainly to economy scale lawdecreasing the impact of plant cost per produced unit for increased size, but there is also a critical aspectin the hydrometallurgical section in the LRVP whose size was chosen avoiding small equipment withexpensive controls. This leads to a working time for this section that is only 1/10 of the time, which isnot an efficient operating solution. Therefore, aiming to recycle 3000 t/y of EOL-PVPs, an alternativesolution to make the process economically feasible would be to exclude from the investment thehydrometallurgical section and sell the Ag-Si-EVA material to external processers.Energies 2020, 13, 6690 14 of 17Operating costs break down evidenced that labor costs are the main components (Figure 6).Analyzing the different labor contribution it is also evident that dismantling activity of the externalframes is the largest one (Figure 7). This is a crucial aspect to be considered in the techno-economicassessment of the developed process as it represents a limiting factor for the scale-up. Pilot-scale testshighlighted as one operator can manually remove the frame from one EOL-PVP in 5 min. Given theaverage weight of 20 kg/EOL-PVP, 1 labor hour produces the dismantling of 240 kg of EOL-PVPs.The manual removal of the aluminum frame from PVP can be thus considered as a time-cost constraintin the process. For this reason, it was simulated as a continuous operation taking place 24/7 for330 days/y. This consideration implies that increasing the process throughput from 3000 to 30,000 t/yrequires a linear increase in the labor hours at the manual dismantling from 1.58 to 16.13 per hour.In other words, the batch feed of 1.59 ton per hour of dismantled EOL-PVPs in the LRVP can beobtained by having 1.58 labor hour per hour while the 16.20 t/y in the HRVP requires having 12.13 laborhour per hour. This constraint also suggests that an increase in the process feasibility could be attainedby replacing the manual removal of the frames with an automated and faster technology.For the above-mentioned reasons, the only labor considered to increase linearly by scaling up10 times the process is the one for manual dismantling. The labels in Figure 7 highlights the laborhours per year associated with this section increases by 5.7 times by scaling up the process from 3000 to30,000 t/y of EOL-PVPs (the increase is not exactly linear to the scale-up because it contains the non-linearlabor for EOL-PVPs handling and storage). In contrast, the other labor requirement accounted only fora few extra-people to face the larger throughput. Clearly, the 4-fold increase in operating costs observedby scaling-up 10 times the process arisen from a balance between these two kinds of costs. Furthermore,the fourfold increase in operating costs despite the 10 times higher recycling volume actually suggestsas the sum of all costs that are linearly proportional to the throughput (e.g., manual dismantling,raw materials, utilities, etc.) are slightly lower than the others.In order to improve economic feasibility of the process the automatization of frames removalseems to be the best option.A final consideration about energy balances from simulations that highlighted another interestingfeature of the advanced Photolife process: the thermal treatment of the EVA offers a significant energycredit. In particular, considering the simulation at 30,000 t/y, the exothermic thermal degradation ofEVA (calorific value −45 kJ/g [38]) would produce about 12.5 MWh/batch that could be convenientlyrecovered where needed across the flowsheet. Then, according to a possible energy recovery scheme,part of this energy can be recovered to heat up the leaching reactor and the cyclohexane evaporator,requiring 0.025 and 1.4 MWh/batch, respectively. However, the recovered heat would still correspondonly to the 11% of the total energy credit (12.5 MWh/batch), thus leaving a theoretical surplus of about11 MWh/batch available for other heating tasks (for instance thermal conditioning of cyclohexanehaving a fusion point of 7 ◦C). Then including thermal valorization of EVA the energy consumptionof the recycling process is reduced and the recovery targets achieved. Otherwise not including thisoperation, recovery rate (sum of recycled materials plus material used for energy production) wouldbe the same than recycling rate (82%) not satisfying EU target (85%).5. ConclusionsIn this work, two processes (the Photolife process and the advanced Photolife process) for EOLPVP treatment were compared in terms of recycling rate, recovery rates and recoverable value rate.The Photolife process was implemented at pilot scale demonstrating the technical feasibility of theoperations allowing for the recovery of high value glass and metals from frames and metallic contacts.Nevertheless, the PhotoLife process did not include the recycling (or recovery) of polymers and metalsfrom the cells (including Ag and Si).Mass balances of the processes evidenced that the integration in the advanced Photolife processof operations for polymer separation, EVA combustion and Ag-Si recycling can greatly improveboth recycling rate (from 75% to 82%) and recoverable value (from 30% to 75%). Then, according toEnergies 2020, 13, 6690 15 of 17preliminary lab scale tests, the advanced Photolife process exceeded EU targets in terms of recyclingrate (82% vs. 80%) and recovery rate (94% vs. 85%) guaranteeing high value products recycling.The simulations for the advanced PhotoLife process highlighted its economic feasibility only athigh recycling volume (30,000 t/y). By recycling 30,000 ton of EOL-PVPs per year, the return of theinvestment would be about 29% with a NPV at 1% interest of 14,275,000 $.The main throughput/economic constraint in the process is represented by the manual workrequired to remove the Al frames from the EOL-PVPs. Replacing this manual work with automatedoperations might improve considerably the process economy and probably make the process feasiblealso at lower recycling volumes.Another point for further optimization is the hydrometallurgical section of the recyclingprocess/plant, whose economy could be significantly improved by avoiding long inactive timesbetween batches. This could be obtained by developing a multi-waste process treating not only PVPbut also other silver-rich wastes such as Ag-batteries.Further simulations will address the effect of these options (automatization of dismantling andinclusion of the treatment of Ag-containing wastes) on the economic feasibility of the advancedPhotoLife process for different flow rates.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, F.P., P.A., E.M. and L.T.; Methodology, A.R., L.B. and G.G.; Software,G.G.; Validation, E.M., L.B. and P.A.; Formal analysis, L.B.; Investigation, A.R.; Data curation, A.R., G.G. and L.B.;Writing—original draft preparation, A.R.; Writing—review and editing, F.P.
