Research Institute of Organic Agriculture FiBLinfo.suisse@fibl.org, www.fibl.orgInfluence of heat and drought stress on economic efficiency and resilience of EU dairy farmsZürich, 29.10.2019AgroeconetSylvain Quiédeville (sylvain.quiedeville@fibl.org)www.fibl.orgIntroduction  Increasing challenges at farm level in the context of climate change Heat and drought stress are two key climate related challenges at farm level, often impacting the production and economic performance limited evidence on the association of climate challenges and dairy farm performance Economic efficiency and resilience are relevant indicators of performanceWhat is the influence of heat and drought stress on economic efficiency and resilience on EU dairy farms ?  In the frame of the H2020 project Gentore (GENomic management Tools to Optimize Resilience and Efficiency) (2017-2022)2www.fibl.orgData  FADN database from 2007 to 2013 Panel data of 4,669 individual farms in 24 EU countries Performance measurement : technical efficiency and economic resilience Output expressed in milk yield per dairy cow Inputs expressed in constant monetary values (2013) Climate indicators : regional heat and drought stress (derived from the Agri4cast database)3www.fibl.orgSteps Use of a Latent Class model (Orea and Kumbhakar, 2004) to assign NUTS2 regions to climatic classes that represent similar production environments  Estimation of technical efficiency and economic resilience by class using a panel stochastic frontier model (Battese and Coelli,1995) and a downside risk parameter (Chavas, 2008), respectively Evaluation of the influence of heat and drought stress on efficiency and resilience using regression models(Unit of analysis: dairy cow)4www.fibl.orgEfficiency methodology (1)  Cobb-Douglas functional form: underlying assumption of constant returns to scale tested (Abdulai and Huffman, 2000) Time-varying model with true fixed-effects (Greene, 2005) Half-normal distribution for the inefficiency term (Kumbhakar et al. 2015).  Input variables:   Feed Forage Machinery Labour Others5www.fibl.orgEfficiency methodology (2)  In the frame of the SF panel model, the effect of climatic stress on the inefficiency term is investigated (combined estimation process) Climatic regressors :  number of periods of at least 40 consecutive dry days (<3mm/day) the same variable but with a lagged effect (previous year) the number of periods of at least 3, 10, or 20 consecutive days, depending on the class characteristics, with a Temperature Humidity Index (THI) strictly above 60 THI=(1.8xTdb+32)−[(0.55−0.0055xRH)x(1.8+Tdb−26.0] (NRC, 1971) Additional regressors farm size (UAA) stocking density dairy specialisation rate price of milk (/dt)6www.fibl.orgEconomic resilience methodology  Downside risk calculated on an annual basis for each farm= actual gross margin – average gross margin over 2007-2013 Tobit panel data model (dependent variable right censored at the 0 value) (Tobin, 1958) Same climatic and additional regressors as in efficiency analysis7www.fibl.orgClass splitting8ZONE

in the EU dairy sector Little influence of drought Significant negative influence of the heat across all classes apart from class UPLLittle scope for efficiency improvement, but heat stress adaptation strategies need to be further considered Economic resilience:  Significant negative influence of the drought across all classes, but less clear in class NA and WA Significant negative influence of the heat across all classes apart from class CON and UPLClear threats to economic resilience, requiring adaptation strategieswww.fibl.orgReferences14Abdulai, A., Huffman, W., 2000.
