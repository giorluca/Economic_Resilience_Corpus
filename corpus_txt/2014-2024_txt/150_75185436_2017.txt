Summary:

Rare earth elements (REE’s) are being incorporated into today’s products at an increasing rate. 
Their value is due to an increased demand and limited supply, both of which are because of their 
rarity in the earth’s crust and high cost of extraction. Due to the increasing demands of REE’s, it 
is corporately and nationally advantageous to identify strategies to edge into the market if it is 
found to be economically viable. By looking into the clay byproduct stream of the “wet” 
production of phosphoric acid from fluorapatite, this report will attempt to outline a process in 
which the extraction of REE’s from clay contains enough material to be beneficial for the 
producer. The following paper covers a process design and analysis concerning the recovery of 
REE’s and its economic feasibility. 
 
1.0 Introduction: 
In the following report, results on the economic feasibility of extracting rare earth 
elements (REE’s) from a byproduct stream in the wet production of phosphoric acid are 
assessed. REE’s are increasingly being integrated into technologies involved with green energy, 
military research, and consumer electronics and have become valuable in today’s global market. 
The demand for these technologies in the Unites States is growing due to technological 
advances, but domestic profits are limited because of our current reliance on foreign REE 
suppliers. By analyzing and optimizing economically viable process designs, REE recovery can 
decrease the United States’ dependence on foreign competitors, such as China, while providing 
beneficial value to industries. 
Rare earth elements can be found in ores that are mined for phosphoric acid (H3PO4) and 
in the associated byproduct streams of those production sites. Every year roughly 220 million 
tonnes of phosphate rock is processed with 32 million of that being in the United States. The 
phosphoric acid industry is stable in many markets and products, so the REE supply is steady 
and readily available for REE recovery is pursued. The State of Florida has already initiated an 
effort to try and recover them from the several H3PO4 production sites where the waste streams 
are unused. The production of phosphoric acid can be categorized into either “wet” or “dry” 
processes. Our focus will revolve around the “wet” phosphoric acid production, which generates 
four byproducts: phosphogypsum rock, sand, clay and sludge. These four waste streams have 
differing economic potential with respect to REE recovery, but the byproduct stream of focus for 
this paper is the clay. The primary design objective of this report is to develop and analyze a 
5 
 
flow sheet, capital cost, and operating cost for an REE extraction process from the clay 
byproduct stream of a “wet” phosphoric acid production site; the report will then be compared 
with others in an attempt to procure the most beneficial design with modifications, if necessary. 
The scale of the facility will be based upon a feed stream of four million metric tonnes of clay 
per year. The chosen process design, with its economic and chemical considerations, is presented 
in the following report. The only requirement of design was that the REE product be at least 50% 
REE by mass and non-radioactive. This paper uses a CEPCI of 558.6 as estimated from 
Chemical Engineering Online projection estimates for February, 2017. Energy demands of the 
process was estimated using the modern day cost of Natural Gas per gigajoule of energy. Many 
of the figures, tables, experimental values and recommendations came from data derived from 
the work and personal assistance of David Depaoli of Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), Patrick 
Zhang of the Florida Phosphate Research Institute (FIPR) and Thomas Gaetjens and Robert 
Counce from the University of Tennessee. 
 
2.0 Synthesis Information for Processes 
 
2.1 Overall Process Design 
     The “wet” production of phosphoric acid involves many steps that are not introduced 
here. The focus of this manuscript revolves around the clay waste stream produced from 
phosphate rock processing. The process described below is a beneficiation and refinement 
technique used to isolate phosphate rock from a slurry that is composed of sand, clay, and other 
relatively large impurities. The process is generalized to avoid unnecessary detail and allow for 
an effective focus on the overall design. For questions concerning regulations, the Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) uses a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for phosphate rock 
processing (1475) and a 6-digit Source Classification Code (SCC) for phosphate rock processing 
(3-05-019). The method of purification relies on many factors that include phosphate ore content 
and size, phosphoric acid production plant specifications, state codes, etc. Some will be 
highlighted here.  
Phosphate ore from the mine will be analyzed to assess its overall quality. Most size 
separation techniques require the use of hydrocyclones and flotation tanks; floatation methods 
may use hydrophilic or hydrophobic chemical reagents with aeration to separate suspended 
particles. Furthermore, because of the use of water (to limit dust and ease transportation) and 
6 
 
dependent on the organic content of the slurry, the ore may be dried and/or calcined. The state of 
Florida has low organic content and uses rotary and fluidized driers with direct fire from natural 
gas and/or fuel oil. Other phosphate ore reserves contain organics and must be heated to 760 to 
870°C (1400 to 1600°F) to remove them; fluidized and rotary calciners are used, here. Overall 
particle size will determine the need for the dried/calcined slurry to be crushed and grinded. 
Crushing techniques tend to involve “impact” crushing, while grinding techniques typically 
utilize rod or ball mills. Circulating air streams remove particulates from the air to reduce toxic 
or radioactive emissions. Overall, these processes are transformative of the physical properties of 
the source slurry and not chemically altering. 
Overall supply refinement is dependent, heavily, on phosphoric acid plant design and 
requirements. Some, or even none, of the process illustrated above may be performed prior to 
arrival of a phosphoric acid production site; production sites may house their own methods and 
techniques depending on the quality of the supply. The highlighted points above are discussed to 
depict the processes that clay streams may undergo before REE extraction. 
 
2.2 Chemical Equations 
    Leaching/Extraction Equation 
The REE’s (represented by “Ln”) that reside in the waste streams, particularly clay, are 
phosphates (LnPO4). To be leached from the waste stream, they are reacted with sulfuric acid 
(H2SO4) to become soluble sulfates, as is seen in the following equation: 
2LnPO4 + 3 H2SO4 => Ln2(SO4)3 + 2H3PO4          eq. 1 
    Secondary Equations 
Consequently, other metals in the waste stream react with sulfuric acid. They, however, become 
insoluble species, and it is this molecular characteristic that will be capitalized on. The metal 
oxides of the clay feed undergo the following reactions: 
Fe2O3 + 3H2SO4 => Fe2(SO4)3 + 6H2O           eq.2 
Al2O3 + 3H2SO4 => Al2(SO4)3 + 6H2O           eq.3 
      MgO + H2SO4 => MgSO4 + H2O               eq.4 
CaO + H2SO4 => CaSO4 + H2O                       eq.5 
 
Reformation Equation 
7 
 
Unfortunately, REE sulfates are not marketable. Once isolated, they must be transformed into 
oxides, which solidify as a precipitate and can, from there, be dried, stored, and shipped. The 
reactions that rare earth sulfates, and then rare earth oxalates, must undergo are as follows: 
Ln2(SO4)3 + H2C2O4 => 10H2O + Ln2(C2O4)3 + 3H2SO4      eq.6 
Ln2(C2O4)3 + 1.5O2 => Ln2O3 + 6CO2                                    eq.7 
 
2.3 Literature Summary 
    The rare earth elements are a categorization of elements that include the lanthanides, yttrium, 
and scandium. Although similar in atomic structure, each have unique properties that offer 
various benefits. Neodymium is known to be a main component of magnets, while erbium is 
used for optical fiber data transmission.1 Figure 1 illustrates the various industries that capitalize 
on REE traits. 
 
Figure 2.1: Uses of REE’s in the United States as reported by the 
United States Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summary, 
2017 
 
Although REE’s are, in many ways, beneficial, they are also known to be harmful and 
detrimental to one’s health and the environment. Many industrial processes disregard the adverse 
effects and dispose, improperly, of waste that is partially composed of REE’s. Referring back to 
the production of phosphoric acid, phosphogypsum (gypsum), a byproduct whose composition is 
high in REE’s, has been shown to decrease biodiversity when leached into water sources. 
Currently, the most environmentally friendly way of disposing of gypsum is dump it into piles 
called “gyp” stacks and limit their access to water.2 
8 
 
In an attempt to both increase the supply of and decrease environmental harm from 
REE’s, studies on recoverability and recyclability are being performed, as much as the research 
on their usefulness is. One study proved the viability of biosorption with the use of brown algae 
on industrial waste in nature. Its results are leading to further research in REE recovery of similar 
techniques.3 Other studies are being conducted on economically sound methods of REE 
recovery. One such study showed how salmon milt, a low-cost waste product of fisheries, 
worked well via ion-exchange on the extraction of REE’s.4 
Extraction of REE’s is becoming a well-studied practice with time. Leaching experiments 
are comparing the most suitable chemicals to reduce the cost and increase efficiency when 
isolating these elements. A study by N.B. Egorov et al. showed how the decomposition of rare 
earth phosphates (REP’s), via sulfuric acid or sodium hydroxide, can have an improved degree of 
leaching with the addition of NH4NF2 or NH4F, while another study, by J. Amaral et al., 
indicates how various REE’s, with different chemical properties, could be isolated 
simultaneously.5,6 One of the leading methods of REE leaching is liquid-liquid separation (LLE); 
this is a method that incorporates the transfer of one or more solute(s) to a solvent based on 
relative solubilities. A study using betaine-betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic 
liquid system placed emphasis on this solvent’s ability to extract neodymium with relatively 
small vapor pressure, low flammability, and high thermal stability. More common techniques 
used in industry include the use of Di-(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), 2-
ethylhexylphosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (HEHEHP), and Aliquat 336.7,8 Less 
common techniques include cation and anion exchangers.9

2.7 Design Variables 
 The design variables associated with the development and capital assessment of this plant 
process are based on various assumptions, the main assumption being that the base-case values 
remain constant. (This report is specified on a waste stream flow rate and composition described 
by the analytical results of Dr. Patrick Zhang of the Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research 
(FIPR) Institute.) Further mentioned is that the product is to be solid at >50% elemental REE 
concentration and must contain and acceptable product level of radioactivity. Another 
assumption is that the waste stream is considered dilute solids because of the solid content of the 
streams; they are not pure and must first be subjected to particle separation methods using a 
carrier fluid to separate out the desirable solids or beneficiation. 
 Also, per Dr. Haing Liang, the performance of the hydrocyclone, floatation, and leaching 
vessels are analytically assumed to be:  
Hydrocyclone performance: 
12 to 15 wt% solids in underflow (course clay stream) 
Up to 35 to 40 wt% of solids recovered in underflow 
Flotation performance: 
 > 30 % recovery of solids in concentrate 
> 70 % REE recovery in concentrate 
> 80 % P2O5 recovery in concentrate 
Leaching performance: (H2SO4:CaO = 4, 230 °C) 
 90 % REE recovery 
95 % P2O5 recovery 
Leaching of Al, Mg, and Fe: 35%, 20% and 10%, respectively 
 
2.8 Cost Information 
 Raw Material cost, by-product credits, and product values are outlined in section 2.4 and 
the cost of energy is taken to be the market cost of Natural Gas as given by the EIA. The design 
costs are estimated by costing tables in Chemical Engineering: Process Design and Economics, 
a Practical Guide by Gael D. Ulrich with a CEPCI of 558.6 as given by a projection for 
February, 2017 from Chemical Engineering Online, or information given by consulting groups 
(classmates or Dr. Counce). The initial dilution cost (around $8 Million annually) was ignored; 
13 
 
the assumption was that the clay was already diluted upon receiving it to the front end of our 
process. 
 The expense data assumptions are summarized in the following tables:

Other assumptions include the full recovery of Sulfuric Acid leaving through the dryer and 
extractor, as well as some auxiliary cost. However, we did not assign any by-product credits to 
the Phosphorous pentoxide (P2O5 is the empirical formula) by which the majority of the sales 
would be derived.  
 
3.0 Method of Approach 
 
3.1 How Project Objectives are Obtained 
 The main objective of this project is “to estimate the capital and manufacturing costs in 
2017 U.S. dollars to produce a rare earth element (REE) product” from the clay waste stream of 
a “wet” phosphoric acid production plant. To achieve this, engineers must obtain background 
information (including but not limited to: current review articles (rational), design variables 
(constraints), and ChE indexes), develop plant processes, estimate start-up and annual costs, and 
assess feasibility (implementation of the plant in today’s regulations and standards). 
 The basis of this project is a feed rate of 4 billion kg of clay waste per year. The 
composition of this feed stream is illustrated in Appendix A. The process of extracting REE’s 
from this clay feed stream occur in steps illustrated by the detailed schematic shown below in 
Figure 3.1. 
 
Figure 3.1: Flow diagram of the REE recovery process from a clay waste stream. 
15 
 
3.1.1 Hydrocyclone 
Initial processing of the clay waste is achieved via hydrocyclone. The clay waste is 
diluted with water until a stream composition of 97% water, 3% clay is satisfied. Hydrocyclone 
performance is based off data from Liang’s lab and is assumed to be the following: 14 wt% 
solids, 86 wt% water underflow composition, with 38 wt% of solids recovered. The rest is 
recovered in the top fine stream, which was not considered in this design. Table 3.1.1 shows the 
input and output information for the hydrocyclone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
16 
 
Table 3.1.1: Data for clay waste stream processing via hydrocyclone showing input stream 
and two output streams. Flow basis is kg/s. 
 
 
3.1.2 Flotation Vessel 
Further processing of the clay waste is done via the use of a flotation vessel, which 
generates a stream higher in purity of REEs and P2O5. 30% solids are recovered in the flotation 
concentrate, with the rest recovered as tailings, which can be processed in a separate design not 
17 
 
discussed here. In the concentrate, 70% of REEs and 80% of P2O5 are recovered. Table 3.1.2a 
shows the mass balance for the flotation vessel. 
 
Table 3.1.2a: Data for clay waste stream processing via flotation vessel showing input 
stream and two output streams. Flow basis is kg/s. 
 
18 
 
 
Chemicals are used in the vessel to separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic components. These are 
presented in Table 3.1.2b in terms of total mass present in the vessel. 
 
Table 3.1.2b: Flotation chemicals. 
 
 
3.1.3 Leaching Vessel 
After initial processing of the clay, it is sent into the leaching vessel for reaction with 
sulfuric acid. Rare earth phosphates are subsequently converted to sulfates, and phosphoric acid 
is generated from P2O5. A REE conversion of 90% was assumed based on a H2SO4:CaO ratio of 
4:1 (from Liang). Conversion performance for magnesium, iron, and aluminum oxides were also 
specified by Dr. Counce and are included in Table 3.1.3, which breakdowns the balance around 
the leaching vessel.

is sent to vessel and reacted with sulfuric acid. Extent of reaction based on conversion. 
 
Notes: Products (very bottom) emerge with unreacted inputs in stream 8, the leachate.

3.1.4 Solvent Extraction System 
After separation of solid and acid products from the leaching vessel via filtration, drying, 
and cooling, during which most water is removed, the iron, aluminum, and magnesium sulfates, 
and the REEs are mixed with sulfuric acid in a 1:1 mol ratio to create the aqueous stream input to 
the solvent extraction system. The REEs are first absorbed into an organic solvent to separate 
them from the metal sulfates, then stripped back into the aqueous phase. Distribution coefficients 
of REEs for absorption and stripping were provided by Dr. Counce. The schematic below shows 
the solvent extraction system. 
 
 
 
Figure 3.1.4: A summary of the Solvent Extraction process. The stages in the absorber and 
stripper are modeled as separate mixer-settler units for sizing and costing purposes. 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3.1.4 shows the input streams, distribution coefficients and absorption and extraction 
factors for each REE, and recovery streams. 
21 
 
 
22 
 
3.1.5 Precipitation Reactor 
The extraction REEs from the Solvent Extraction System are then sent to a precipitation 
reactor. Here, REE sulfates react with oxalic acid to form REE oxalates, a form that can be 
oxidized via calcination, the final unit operation.  
 
Table 3.1.5: Data for the precipitator vessel. 
 
 
3.1.6 Calcination Reactor 
A sedimentation tank following the precipitation reactor helps to remove excess liquid from the 
effluent, and then the mixture is sent to the final unit, the calcination reactor.  
 
 
23 
 
Table 3.1.6: Data for Calciner 
 
 
3.2 Topics to be Assessed 
 To assess feasibility, the plant process will be broken down into various areas of thought 
ranging from capital sustainability to regulatory compliance. Section 3.3 through 3.6 are more in-
depth analysis of these topics. 
 
3.3 Sustainability 
 When assessing sustainability, engineers must consider a financial analysis that includes 
annual costs and net annual profit. Through the use of market projections and inflation, the 
24 
 
sustainability of the plant can then be projected. Sustainability must take into account the 
lifespan of the plant, itself, and the scrap value of the plant for when costs begin to outweigh 
profit. Another important goal is providing for the needs of present generations without 
neglecting the ability to meet future needs.  
 
3.4 Financial 
 In order to perform a financial analysis, engineers need to take into account the grass 
roots startup costs of the plant, which can be estimated from the mass and energy balances, the 
estimated raw material costs, and the product values. Future estimations need to be done based 
on discount factors, inflations, and the longevity of the plant (which may also affect the scrap 
value).  
 
3.5 Environment 
 Since the first environmental movement in the mid-1900’s, industry has had to abide by 
more and more protective regulations. These pieces of legislature are set by federal and state 
departments, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and respective state 
environmental agencies. They implement regulatory practices that include, but are not limited to, 
emissions, site impact, waste disposal, and energy consumption/output. In a social context, 
progressive movements have limited, if not completely inhibited, plant processes. To avoid 
confrontation, many companies express a desire to assist environmentalist and be “morally 
proactive” on this front. Depending on the economic feasibility and environmental impact of our 
plant process, we may look towards expressing a cooperative mindset directed toward 
environmental protection. 
 
3.6 Worker Safety and Health 
 Within the development of industry, work conditions grew to be more dangerous and 
unhealthy. This, linked to more frequent accidents, pushed government to intervene with the first 
factory regulatory bill, the Massachusetts Factory Act of 1877. Since then, numerous others 
regulatory laws have been passed on behalf of worker safety and health concerns. To pass 
inspections, a plant would have to abide by both federal and state regulations, which are imposed 
by the United States Department of Labor (DOL) and the associated state labor bureau(s), 
25 
 
respectively. Also, factories must pass inspections associated with site and process specific laws. 
This may include but is not limited to machinery, such as the operating and maintaining of 
pumps, and chemicals, such as the handling, storing, and use of Sulfuric Acid. It should be 
mentioned that this plant will be handling radioactive material and proper use and disposal of 
such items must be in accordance with federal and state laws, as well. Lastly, industrial plants, 
such as this one, may have to abide by regulations sets by unions; those regulatory items will be 
established by contract and specific to the union and plant at the time of negotiation. 
 
4.0 Results  
 The main idea of this process is to harvest REE’s from the waste stream “wet” production 
of phosphoric acid. REE’s are supposed to be the primary source of product; however, as one can 
see in Table 4.2.1 the annual sales from the REE oxides are nearly 15 times less than the sales 
from the byproduct value of Phosphoric Acid. (Note: In the annual expense estimation, though 
phosphoric acid is a byproduct credit of this process, the massive worth of this sale offsets the 
expenses and produce a large error in the financial calculations of the expenses. Therefore, the 
phosphoric acid was considered a sale as opposed to a byproduct in the cost analysis.) If the 
phosphoric acid is removed is the project still viable? A Cost Profile Comparison was created for 
the purpose of answering this question. Table 4.0.1 Contains information on the cash flow 
analysis as is with and without the phosphoric acid sales. Similarly Figure 4.0.1 is a visual 
representation of the data. 
 Project construction was assumed to take around two full years with investments of equal 
increments each year; the working capital was assumed to be invested during the startup year. 
Discount rates were assumed at 0%, 10% and 15% to show potential flow profiles over the next 
ten years. A ten year life was assumed for the process.

As one can see, the REE process is supported almost entirely by the sales of the phosphoric acid, 
without it their simply would be no profit. Note, however, that the process does have a 
reasonable PBP. 
 
 4.1 Capital Costs Estimates 
 The equipment of necessity, previously explained, and their respective costs were 
estimated with Gael Ulrich’s Chemical Engineering Process Design and Economics: A Practical 
Guide11, as well as from quotes derived from correspondence with our professor and other 
references he provided. Table 4.1.1 is the Capital Cost Summary. It displays a summary of the 
cost data for each piece of equipment and estimates the Grass Roots Capital needed to build the 
plant. The grass roots capital cost is estimated to be $32.6 million. (A note of caution, this is an 
estimate; many items including all auxiliary equipment, with the exception of a few intermediary 
tanks and sedimentation units, are left out. Pumps and unique piping elements are not 
considered, and the estimates for the existing equipment are rough.) To help illustrate the process 
of calculating these costs, example calculations for the leaching vessel are shown below; 
complete calculations are listed in Appendix C.

4.2 Manufacturing Cost Estimate 
The manufacturing expenses are all those direct, indirect or otherwise that are associated 
with the production of the REE’s in the process. These include, but are not limited to, utility 
costs, maintenance costs, and labor costs. Raw material costs are also calculated based on the 
amount needed per unit flow of feed (specific to the unit operation). The total annual expenses is 
estimated at $29.1 million; the data used to estimate this total value is shown in Table 4.2.1. 
Again, Ulrich’s book was used for calculation purposes.

5.0 Discussion of Results 
 The design process shown above provides an economically viable system to recover and 
sell REE’s from the clay waste stream of a “wet” phosphoric acid production plant. The annual 
revenue from REE’s is relatively small compared to the profit yielded from the sale and resale of 
phosphoric and sulfuric acid. Actually, without the later, the given process would not yield a 
profit. Whereas the sales from REE’s is ~$3.2 million, the sales from phosphoric acid is ~$47.9 
million, and with a manufacturing cost way above the former, the only viable option would be to

reap a benefit from the byproducts of the system. One of the reasons for the small return based 
on the REE’s is because of our percent yield, which is 20% (see “Sum REE” in stream 1 and 
stream 24). Another reason could be due to the large manufacturing cost because of the raw 
materials (organic solvent, steam, etc.); this cost, alone, is more than two-thirds the annual fee, 
and a reduction here would allow for a larger annual return. Chart 5.1 illustrates these effects. 
 
 
Chart 5.1: Major manufacturing costs visualized as percentages. 
 
As is seen in section 4.1 and 4.2, the fixed and working capital costs equate to ~$32.6 
million and ~$5 million, respectively. This sums up to a total capital investment of ~$37.6. Chart 
5.2 is a visual of the bare module cost breakdown for the major unit operations of the process. It 
is worth noting the large cost of the leaching vessel, which makes up nearly 68% of the total 
cost. The vessel was designed to withstand pressures of up to 50 barg (reasonable safety estimate 
due to the steam being the largest energy influx to the system; i.e. the vessel could not 
reasonably increase beyond 45 barg) in addition to having to handle caustic chemicals. The 
material factor was 9.8 as seen above due to the Nickel based alloy chosen for the design 
material. If the cost of the vessel can be reduced by some means, the feasibility of this process’s 
economic worth would increase greatly. Among other groups, the cost of the solvent ligand was

typically outrageously high. We believe in order to mitigate this issue, a vacuum should pull the 
water out of the filtrate in order to reduce total volume capacity of the moving fluid. Once the 
water is removed from the filtrate and the volume is greatly reduced, the amount of solvent 
needed for extraction is greatly reduced as is the size of the downstream unit operations. Doing 
this allowed us to have a solvent cost of around $36.6 thousand initially.  
 
 
 Chart 5.2: Major Bare Module Cost visualized as percentages. 
 
Referring to section 4.0, the payback period (PBP) would not be overcome until a 
duration of roughly 1.86 years has been achieved. However, the net payout time (NPT) is 2.14, 
and the discount break even period (DBEP) is 4.14. With this being said, after a period of 10 
years the plant is expected to yield a net present value (NPV) of $102,777,950.00.  
 
6.0 Conclusions 
 The current design process that is implemented for the sole recovery and sale of REE’s 
from the clay waste stream of a wet production plant of phosphoric acid is not economically 
viable. However, with the respective sale and resale of phosphoric and sulfuric acid, the plant 
deems a substantial profit. Further studies and future work on the design processes could 
increase efficiency and minimize costs, plus careful studies and development of the REE market 
could lead to more dependency on that specific product.

7.0 Recommendations 
 Post conclusion, we have put together recommendations that could further increase the 
accuracy of our report and efficiency of the overall plant process. To start, we address final plant 
designs and calculated costs. Items that we have intentionally neglected include, but are not 
limited to, the pipes, pumps, and storage tanks that would rely on information needed from 
specific site dimensions and local regulations. We recommend, with the comprehensive 
objectives of the plant or company in mind, that unit operations either remain close together to 
decrease costs associated with the aforementioned items or spaced apart for the flexibility to 
install and adjust plant processes over time. 
 The second item we address would be the need to optimize various, specific unit 
operations. For example, our design of the solvent extractor was based on the volume of fluid 
flowing through the system, however, we believe, that this item can become more efficient by 
analyzing the extract and raffinate streams to select a more ideal number of stages. Other 
components that can be assessed include the life span of the plant and what duration would allow 
for maximum profit between fixing/replacing part and scrap value. Lastly, one may want to 
design a recycling process for sulfuric acid; this could save time and money in replace of 
extracting and reselling the chemical. 
 Lastly, we would recommend that specialist consider the isolation and removal of 
radioactive material. We know from the mass balance and federal regulations that too much is 
being extruded with the product to be sold without proper preparation. Also, due to the annual 
amount of material handled, costs will accumulate in association with the safety equipment and 
plant protocols established in regards to worker safety. Detailed commentary on this subject can 
be found in Appendix B.  
 Other recommendations include changing the design material of the leaching vessel. 
Doing this may bring down the material factor reducing the cost greatly. This could be done by 
potentially lining the vessel with rubber or glass, though these options may prove unfeasible. 
Another recommendation that we would make is to reduce the volumetric flow by every possible 
means to the solvent extraction system. This would reduce the cost of the neutral ligand because 
of the smaller capacity. Given the ligand’s expense we cannot recommend this any greater. 
Thirdly, find ways to reduce utility cost. A great deal of the cost came from steam and water. In 
fact, the steam cost was found to be nearlyt equivalent to the sale value of the recovered REE’s. 
33 
 
 Finally, after examining the process, we have determined that the process for REE 
recovery seems unfeasible economically even if the best cost cutting measures are taken. We 
suggest shifting focus to more lucrative routes such as the recovery of the P2O5 from the clay 
which would be hyrdrated fto form Phosphoric Acid and sold at a huge profit that would dwarf 
any sale the REE’s would hope to achieve.

Appendix B: Uranium and Thorium Guidelines 
Design Steps 
Uranium and Thorium was primarily ignored throughout most of the process design steps 
due to the complications and indecisiveness of how to approach government limits. It was 
suggested by reviewers (made up of FIPR, Idaho and ORNL representatives) that the Uranium 
and Thorium would be removed through a TDP solvent extraction system. It remains to be seen 
whether it would be possible for simultaneous removal of Uranium and Thorium from the 
process stream and the rest of the REEs in our already existing Mixer Settler System. It may be 
feasible to have a three-stage solvent extraction system beginning with our Neutral Ligand which 
would remove our REEs from the process stream along with our Uranium and Thorium, then 
followed up by and intermediary mixer-settler system that would remove the Uranium and

Thorium from the stream via another solvent (organic or aqueous phases yet to determine, in our 
estimation a more selective organic phase might be needed). Finally, this system would be 
followed up with the stripping section that would strip our REEs from the organic phase via most 
likely water. We believe this design, if possible, would add the fewest unit op steps between the 
removal of Uranium and Thorium and simply ignoring its existence. 
Further analysis of Uranium and Thorium was performed on the request of Professor 
Counce. It was found that in the solvent extraction system Thorium is completely extracted and 
recovered, while Uranium is thankfully only recovered on a level of around 40%. This sadly 
does not meet regulations for Uranium and Thorium content as given by the government. The 
amount of recovered radioactive elements reaches nearly 20,000 kilograms per year.
