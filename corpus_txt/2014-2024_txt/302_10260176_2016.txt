Hlavni 130, Rez, 250 68 Husinec, Czech RepublicImplementation of currently considered and available CCS technologies into fossilpower plants brings inevitable technical, energy and economic penalty. This is gettingeven larger when fossil fuels such as low rank coal are being utilized. All threegenerally considered CCS technologies were modelled – oxyfuel combustion andammonia based post-combustion (subcritical power plant with fuel drying) and pre-combustion (IGCC with Rectisol wash for CO2 separation).CCS technologies generally produce significant amounts of waste heat, more thantraditional plants do. Here is suggested its partial utilization by modular units withunit cost comparable to the whole plant and which work independently on the rest ofthe system thus positively affecting also flexibility when compared to sophisticatedrecovery into the whole plant.- Available as regularly supplied as nearly plug and play modular systems.- Standalone units have advantage of higher flexibility of the whole system.- Modules directly adjacent to the heat sourceINTRODUCTIONPOWER PLANTS AND PROCESSES FOR WASTE HEAT RECOVERYREFERENCE CASES AND MODEL INPUTS- Lignite fired coal plant - Approx. 250 MW capacity- CO2 capture ratio 90%- Capture technology by available industrial technologyPOST-COMBUSTION CCS SYSTEMS- Wet ammonia scrubbing method- Waste heat recovery potential low- Desorbed CO2 cooling- CO2 compressors coolingOXYFUEL CCS SYSTEMS- Most significant potentialfor WHR in compressorcooling- ASU compressors cooling- CO2 compressors coolingPRE-COMBUSTION CCS SYSTEMS- Most complex system with large number of utilizable waste heat streams- Coal drying- ASU compressors cooling- O2 compressors cooling- N2 compressors cooling- Syngas cooling- CO2 compressors cooling- Aftercooling of flue gas(very low flue gas dew point)POST-COMBUSTION CCS SYSTEMS- Only 3.6 % of fuel heat content in utilizable streams, low temperature- Positive effect nearly negligibleOXYFUEL CCS SYSTEMS- WHR potential associated especially with largest parasitic load – ASU- Already potential for 1.3 percentage point (p.p.) power increasePRE-COMBUSTION CCS SYSTEMS- IGCC itself (w/o CCS) has already a significant potential for WHR- CCS integration limits standard utilization of several waste heat streams and increases heat flow in themOVERAL RESULTSWASTE HEAT RECOVERY SYSTEMSWaste heat stream Temperature [°C]Heat flow (% of LHV input)WHR unit typePower increase(% of LHV input)CO2 compression IC/AC 102 (cooling fluid) 1.3 LiBr APC 0.03Desorber heating outlet 115 2.3 Isohexane ORC 0.05Saved cooling power - 1.2 - 0.001Waste heat stream Temperature [°C]Heat flow (% of LHV input)WHR unit typePower increase(% of LHV input)ASU air compressors IC/AC 234 (cooling fluid) 3.2 Isohexane ORC 0.40Gasifier O2 compressors IC/AC 246 (cooling fluid) 1.1 Isohexane ORC 0.12Gasifier N2 compressors IC/AC 201 (cooling fluid) 0.3 Isohexane ORC 0.02Coal dryer outlet vapours 110 3.3 LiBr APC 0.14Syngas cooling (CCS / no CCS) 252 / 125 13.2 / 2.6 Isohexane ORC 3.19 / 0.11CO2 compression IC/AC (CCS only) 113 (cooling fluid) 3.8  LiBr APC 0.09Flue gas aftercooler (CCS / no CCS) 110 / 110 6.0 / 7.3 LiBr APC 0.18 / 0.20Saved cooling power (CCS / no CCS) - 31.9 / 10.6 - 0.03 / 0.01- LCOE define by Cost Estimation Methodology for NETL Assessments of Power Plant - Nominal capacity factor 65% for IGCC and 75% for PC plant- Typical cost of ORC units around 1600 - 4000 $/kWe (based on power output)- Fuel price 2.5 USD/GJ (PC plant), 2.75 USD/GJ (IGCC plant)- Discount rate 8%,  annual price rates 1-4%- Highest feasibility comes for most expensive power plant (IGCC) with CCS- Lowest (negative) feasibility comes for IGCC plant without CCSCONCLUSIONA number of processes in some CCS systems with recoverable low temperature heat are significant. Largest technical potential for WHR is in pre-combustion, where it can be utilized both in reference case and with CCS.In case of CCS systems without WHR the IGCC efficiency comes out very similar to the oxyfuel, with WHR systems is the IGCC better in efficiency by 3 p.p.Included baseload only into calculations. Taking into account start-ups and shutdowns may come better, especially for the IGCC without CCS.PC Plant PC plant - OxyfuelPC plant – post combustionIGCC IGCC - CCSOriginal efficiency [%] 38.99 31.13 28.12 43.18 31.27Efficiency with WHR [%] 38.99 32.44 28.20 44.18 35.45Efficiency increase [p.p.] 0 1.31 0.08 1.01 4.18Rankine Cycles- Steam cycle is a standard technologyfor larger scale and temperatures –steam microturbine- Low T, power – Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC), best option in 300-150°C- Currently industrial standard- Modular simple system with seriesproduction allows low cost- Poor feasibility at temperature<120°C due to very high irreversibility- Available with / without recuperatorAbsorption power cycles- Changing temperature along boilingand condensation – low exergy loss- Perspective of higher efficiency thanORC for T < 120°C- Known for NH3-H2O, here novelconcept using H2O-LiBr (from cooling)- Potential for very high turbineefficiency even for very low power- Perspective for modularity as ORC- Potential disadvantages in corrosionrisk, operation entirely in vacuumWaste heat stream Temperature [°C]Heat flow (% of LHV input)WHR unit typePower increase(% of LHV input)ASU air compressors IC/AC 234 (cooling fluid) 9.0 Isohexane ORC 1.13CO2 compression IC/AC 105 (cooling fluid) 7.1 LiBr APC 0.17Saved cooling power - 10.5 - 0.01TECHNICAL RESULTS OF WHR APPLICATIONWaste heat for recoverySTEAM PLANT UNITASH SEPARATION + DESULPHURISATION CO2 ABSORBERCO2 CONDISIONING and COMPRESSION CLEAN FLUE GASDESORBERWaste heat for recoveryBOILER AND STEAM PLANTCO2 CAPTURE unitCO2 CONDISIONING and COMPRESSIONFUEL TREATMENT AND TRANSPORTAIR SEPARATION UNITCLEAN FLUE GASWaste heat for recoveryASH SEPARATION + DESULPHURISATIONECONOMIC RESULTS OF WHR APPLICATION (1) - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7Post CombustionCCSOxyfuel CCS Pre-combustionCCSIGCC w/o CCSΔLCOE [USD/MWh]CCS system OxyfuelPost -combustionPre-combustionPower cycleSubcritical PC plant (575°C/580°C,18.3/3.6 MPa)IGCC(515°C,12.5 MPa)Fuel LHV 9.75 MJ/kg 16.5 MJ/kgWr /Ad / S ~ 31% / ~ 41% / ~ 3% ~ 27% / ~ 18% / ~ 1.7%0100200300400500600500 1500 2500 3500 4500 5500 6500LCOE [USD/MWh]Annual operation time of WHR unit [hour/year]SSC w/o CCS - nominalIGCC w/o CCS - nominalPre-combustion CCSOxyfuel CCSPost-combustion CCSORC 500 USD/kWeORC 1500 USD/kWeORC 2500 USD/kWeORC 3500 USD/kWe
