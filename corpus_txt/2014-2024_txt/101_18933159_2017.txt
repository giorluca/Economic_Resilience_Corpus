Economic Resilience  A new concept for policy making?Inclusive Growth for Germany | 11Economic Resilience  A new concept for policy making?Authors:Henrik BrinkmannChristoph HarendtFriedrich HeinemannJustus Nover              July 20174Economic resilienceAbstractThe idea of “resilience” has in recent years gained  a high level of popularity in the formulation of eco- nomic-policy objectives. Given the rapid sequence  of serious crises, the rise of this concept is hardly sur- prising. If economic shocks are apparently unavoidable, then an economy’s ability to cope with them should be a subject of interest. However, the virtually inflationary use of the resilience concept has been accompanied by  a lack of precision. In particular, there is often no clear understanding that alongside its static interpretation (retention of a system’s existing functions in the case of a crisis), crisis resilience also includes an adaptive dimension (adjustment to new surrounding conditions). Against this background, this article addresses the origin of the resilience concept, illustrates its various usages in  different disciplines, and distinguishes it from other key words (“vulnerability,” “sustainability,” “stability”).  On this basis, the resilience concept is given additional precision and defined in a manner useful for the eco-nomic-policy perspective. A central conclusion is that the concept of resilience can become a normative eco-nomic-policy principle if 1) it is not viewed narrowly as only a static concept; 2) it is linked to the societal objec-tives within the economy being studied; and 3) the inter-play of different societal levels is taken into account.

If one uses the Google search frequency (in the Ger-man-speaking world; see Figure 1), then a rising popularity since the years of the financial and euro debt crises is evi-dent, with further gains since 2014. The appeal of the concept of resilience after years of recur-rent economic and political crisis is hardly surprising. European economies were destabilized in quick succession by the global 2008 – 2009 financial crisis and the subse-quent euro area sovereign debt crisis. Afterward came the escalating refugee crisis in 2015, the EU integration crisis 1 A concept’s careerThe concept of “resilience” appears poised to supplant “sustainability” in terms of the frequency of its use in  the (economic) policy discourse. For the OECD, “economic  resilience” has become a guiding principle in the context  of economic research.1 The term has become part of the standard vocabulary in the formulation of EU economic- policy objectives. For example, the Five Presidents’ Report on the future of the euro zone formulated as an objective  that member states should converge with regard to “stron- ger resilient economic structures” (Juncker et al. 2015: 9). Moreover, the German federal government, in its priorities 1 www.oecd.org/eco/economic-resilience.htmFIGURE 1: Google hits for “Nachhaltigkeit” (sustainability) versus “Resilienz” (resilience)  resilience      sustainabilitySource: Google, own representation.  020406080100201720162015201420132012201120102009200820072006200520047Economic resiliencelevel, as well as with the work of economic-policy decision  makers, plays a decisive role in an economy’s ability to cope with crises.In the following sections, this article first outlines the  history and use of the concept of resilience in various  disciplines. On this basis, with reference to the context of economic policy, a definition of resilience is proposed, and its overlap with and demarcation from other guiding policy principles is worked out. Subsequently, the analysis indi-cates which dimensions must be addressed by a consistent and comprehensive strategy for increasing an economy’s resilience. The article concludes with some considerations regarding the risks associated with the new term, and iden-tifies research needs. that manifested in the Brexit decision, new threats posed  by international terrorism, and increasingly aggressive and/or authoritarian actions by states in the EU’s neighbor- hood. The past years have thus demonstrated that Europe’s economic (and political) environment is continually char-acterized by abrupt change. If such crisis-promoting exter-nal influences are to a certain extent unavoidable, then  the question logically follows as to whether the capacity  to handle and cope with such shocks is in place, and if so, how it is constituted. In this respect, the concept of resil- ience today represents an “idea whose time has come in policy debates” (Martin and Sunley 2014: 2) However, the strong increase in the frequency of usage, paired with the simultaneous lack of deeper conceptual work, increasingly arouses the impression that a trendy new concept is being put into circulation without a genuine  understanding of what it means. The term thus runs the risk of developing into a trendy empty-vessel concept  serving often only as a means of marketing traditional points of view. Against this background, this paper is intended as a contri-bution to establishing greater precision for the concept of resilience from the perspective of economic policy. The goal is to show the degree to which the consideration of resil-ience can in fact produce added conceptual value, and thus can play a normative role in the determination of economic- policy strategies. It appears in particular that the interplay of a static  resilience dimension (a system should retain its ability  to function after a shock) and an adaptive dimension  (a system should show itself as able to adjust to long-term crisis-driven changes in its environment) is indispensable in giving precision to the concept in an economic context. In addition, the economic consideration of resilience should not be limited exclusively to the macroeconomic perspec-tive. The interplay of the macroeconomic level with the behaviors of businesses and workers at the microeconomic 8Economic resilience2 Use of the term, from ecology   to psychologyWord origin and meaning in physicsThe word “resilience” derives from the Latin verb “ris-ilire,” which can be translated as “rebound” or “bounce back.” Thus, in its original meaning, the term refers to the property of an object relative to an active force that has changed its original form. A resilient object in this original word meaning is not permanently changed by the action of the force. The use of the term in physical materials research corresponds closely to this word meaning; here, it refers to the property of a material to return quickly to its original form following a deformation (Martin 2012). Reference to ecological and technological systemsMoving on from this initial meaning, the first major  development in the concept’s history was to make an  analogy between the features of a material on the one hand, and those of a complex system on the other. Holling (1973) pioneered the application of the concept to a system, defin-ing resilience in the field of ecology as follows: “Resilience determines the persistence of relationships within a system and is a measure of the ability of these systems to absorb changes of state variables, driving variables, and param-eters, and still persist” (Holling 1973: 17). The persistence of the ecological system thus refers to the original stable equilibrium. The extent of resilience is in this regard meas-ured on the basis of the strength of the shocks absorbed by the system before the original equilibrium is permanently destabilized (“tipping point”), and is alternatively referred to by Holling as “buffer capacity.” The field of engineering seamlessly follows the use of this term in its ecological sense, except here the focus is on tech-nological rather than natural systems. Complex technological systems are resilient if they can continue to fulfill their func-tions even when impacted by negative external events. The resilience of such systems can be strengthened, for example, through the presence of redundancies (capacity reserves) or flexibilities (the assumption of functions by another subsys-tem when the original subsystem is damaged). Psychology: reference to the person as an individualThe next step in the development of the concept toward  the economic-policy context in which we are here inter-ested is the use of resilience in reference to the person as an individual. In this regard, the field of psychology con-siders an individual’s resilience in relation to severe trau-matic events. “Resilience is the process of effectively nego-tiating, adapting to, or managing significant sources of stress or trauma. Assets and resources within the indiv-id-ual, their life and environment facilitate this capac-ity for adaptation and ‘bouncing back’ in the face of adver-sity. Across the life course, the experience of resilience will vary” (Windle 2011: 12). Here, more clearly than in the pre-viously cited disciplinary contexts, it is not primarily about a return to the status quo in place before the external dis-turbance, because this – due to a chronic illness, a disabil-ity, a drastic social change in living conditions, or the death of a family member – is no longer achievable. The focus is rather on adaptation to the new conditions while preserving a high quality of life. In psychology, a specific performance assessment (quality of life) thus moves into the foreground, on the basis of which the extent of resilience is assessed even in the case of permanent objective changes. The social-sciences contextThe step from the individual dimension to the considera-tion of human resilience in the context of communal sys-tems takes place in the social sciences, and opens up the relevant context for the economic-policy reflections. For 9Economic resilienceexample, regional-studies approaches examine the resil-ience of colony systems shaped by people and their inter-actions. Here, this can be about the consequences of natu-ral disasters for cities, for example (Godschalk 2003). Urban systems are characterized by the interdependence of tech-nological systems (infrastructure) and human commu-nities. Therefore, a purely engineering-focused analy-sis of the technological systems’ performance falls short. The effectiveness of social systems (education institutions, health care sector, public administration, private busi-nesses, neighborhoods, families and so on) is also of sig-nificance, as they are no less critical than technological systems to cities’ functioning. A typical definition of resil-ience from this discipline is that of Mileti (1999: 32-33): “Local resiliency with regard to disasters means that a locale is able to withstand an extreme natural event with-out suffering devastating losses, damage, diminished pro-ductivity or quality of life, and without a large amount of assistance from outside the community.”Social-sciences usages emphasize the adaptive dimensionThe following fundamental difference between ecological  systems on the one hand and systems shaped and influ-enced by people on the other is of great significance for the economic reference: People can prepare themselves pro-spectively for uncertainties, and can learn and make sys-temic changes (Dovers and Handmer 1992). In a natural system, an inherent and unchangeable absorption capac-ity determines the way that shocks are processed. In a social system – in addition to national restrictions (for example, due to limited resources) – conscious elements of design carried out by people are of critical importance.2 Thus, the adaptive dimension of resilience previously emphasized in 2 Ecological systems are also adaptive in an evolutionary sense. In sys-tems controlled by humans, however, adaptation can also take place through conscious decisions.psychology also appears in the context of social-science analysis. Resilience therefore no longer necessarily refers to the capacity of a system to return to an old and unchanged state after a short aberration. Rather, adaptive resilience takes into account the capacity indicated by whether a tran-sition is successfully made to a potential new state, which however is no less satisfactory than the previous state. Cross-disciplinary content of the conceptDespite the differences in the various disciplines’ usages (see also overview in Table 1, or Norris et al. 2008), there are at least three overarching commonalities in the use of the term. Thus, these should also be observed in the use of the term within the economic-policy context. Reference to suddenly occurring adverse disruption: First, considerations of resilience appear primarily in the context of a suddenly occurring negative event (disruption, shock, catastrophe, stress), not in relation to a gradual change in the environment. For example, in regional sciences, resil-ience observations relate to a natural catastrophe such as a flood or earthquake, but not to gradual climate change (Norris et al. 2008). In this regard, resilience is a concept with a specific dynamic understanding: It is about the reac-tion to a short-term adverse event. Exogeneity of the disruption: Second, the consideration of resilience focuses on exogenous, not endogenous devel-opments. Negative developments immanent to the system refer to features of the given (ecological, technical or social) system, and thus constitute an element of its equilibrium. By contrast, resilience refers to system characteristics that appear in reaction to a disruption from the outside.3 3 In practice, the borders here are fluid. A major technological accident, for example, is a typical object of a regional-sciences resilience as-sessment, even if in the broader sense it can be understood as an en-dogenous (induced by the freely chosen use of a certain technology) event.10Economic resilienceTABLE 1: Individual disciplines’ use of resilience as a concept Discipline Physics Engineering/technologyEcology Sociology/disaster  management/politicsPsychologyDefinition(s) /particular-itiesCapacity of a material  to absorb energyProperty of returning to original form after an elastic deformationStability near a point  of equilibriumResilience as a generally static conceptResistance of systems  to shocks (resistance  capacity)Capacity of technical systems, in the case of partial failure, to avoid complete failureCapacity to absorb shocks and retain  relationships within  the systemBuffer capacity to ab-sorb (external) disrup-tions (similar to the re-sistance concept)Probability of persis-tenceDegree of self-organiza-tional capacity within a systemReorganization with re-tention of original struc-tures/identity (retention of qualitatively similar status)Maintenance of essen-tial functions in case  of catastrophe  (without external aid)Capacity to adapt  existing resources / capabilities to new  conditionsDegree to which a  system is capable of  expanding learning and adaptation abilitiesGoal: acceptable  level of (institutional) functionalityPositive adaptation/development despite “high-risk-patient sta-tus,” trauma or chronic stressConstant development despite adverse  factors of influenceBehavior conforming  to laws despite ad-verse socioeconomic factors (forensics)Resilience measurement & dimensionsAmount of absorbable energyDuration before  recovering original form Duration before reach-ing original equilibriumLow extent of effectMagnitude of shock  before a tipping point  is reachedTime before recovery  of previous stateRelative: avoidance of potential catastrophic consequencesRetention of social order/ quality;  social networksResilience as ex  ante non-observable characteristicRetention of  mental healthLiterature  examplesBodin and Wiman 2004, Martin 2012Thalmayr 2015, Martin 2012, Rose 2007Holling 1973,CARRI 2013,Klein et al. 2003Godschalk 2003, Klein et al. 2003, Perrings 2006, UNISDR 2005Windle 2011,CARRI 2013, Deutsches Resilienz Zentrum o.D.Relevance/ relationship to economicsEquilibrium perspective for dynamic economic systems makes little sense Positive:  social dimension  (adaptation,  learning capacity,  social capacity)Political, economic and cross-regional factors are poorly differentiatedPositive: strong  focus on adaptation  to crises in the field  of psychologyIn economics, more  ex ante clarity with  regard to resilience- promoting factors11Economic resilienceDistinction between resilience and prevention: Third, as far back as the word’s origin, the consideration of resilience does not take into account statements regarding the prob-ability of sudden adverse events, but rather addresses the effects and processing of such events. This understand-ing permeates applications in all disciplines. Consequently, analyses of resilience should be conceptually distinguished from issues of crisis origin or prevention. At the core of a resilience strategy is not the prevention of crises, but rather the attempt to cope with a crisis – one which is unavoid-able, or one whose probability can be influenced only to a limited degree – as well as possible. This includes also pro-active measures in the run-up to a possible crisis. However, these are not oriented toward averting the crisis, but rather toward coping with it more effectively through preparatory measures. Additional terminological distinctionsThe contents of the concept of resilience, as given greater precision above, lead to further distinctions between important terms that are significant for the formulation of economic-policy strategies. Resilience versus stability: The resilience of a system is not to be equated with its stability (in the sense of a low degree of volatility) (Rose 2009). Even a system that undergoes considerable short-term fluctuation as the result of a shock can prove to be resilient if, following a phase of instability, it reaches a new equilibrium with performance comparable to that displayed before the shockResilience versus vulnerability: These two terms too should not be equated. Vulnerability is the broader term, encom-passing the extent to which a system is exposed to cri-sis (Rose 2009), and is thus minimized through success-ful crisis-prevention measures. By contrast, the degree to which resilience has been achieved can be assessed only with respect to a crisis. A system in which crisis-pre-vention measures have been successfully carried out reduces its vulnerability. However, it does not necessar-ily thereby improve its resilience (for the case in which the now-less-probable crisis event nevertheless takes place). Resilience versus sustainability: These two concepts dif-fer with respect to their temporal dimension. Sustainabil-ity considerations from ecology to economics are defined on the basis of very long time horizons, typically encompass-ing several generations. Sustainable systems have the pros-pect of fulfilling their functions even after the passage of decades (or centuries). Sustainability is also often a reaction to gradual changes. Observations of resilience are under-taken over a shorter period of time. The systemic disruption under consideration is of a shorter-term and more abrupt nature, and the question of processing the shock, if neces-sary, refers at most to the medium term. As compared to resilience, sustainability is the more comprehensive con-cept; resilience represents a necessary but not sufficient condition for sustainability. 12Economic resiliencefor example, or examines preventative approaches that offer promise with regard to avoiding banking, real-estate, balance-of-trade or economic crises (see overview in Cal-dera Sánchez et al. 2015).In a certain sense, such well-established resilience defini-tions are at the same time too broad (because they combine resilience and crisis exposure) and too narrow (because they suppress the dynamic, adaptive dimensions of the concept, and assess the performance of the economic sys-tem too one-dimensionally). Requirements for an definition for the economic-policy contextIn accordance with the social-science understanding of the resilience concept, a definition in the economic-policy con-text necessarily must include the adaptive dimension, and must not limit itself to a static understanding in the sense of a return to the pre-disruption state. Humans and the systems shaped by them are characterized by the capability to adapt, learn and deal with crises creatively (Dovers and Handmer 1992). This requirement applies particularly with regard to eco-nomic systems, as these are subjected by innovation and growth processes to continuous changes, which can and must be shaped by people. While in the case of an ecologi-cal or technical system it might still be reasonable to speak primarily about a possible return to an old “normal state,” this is not true of an economic system; at best, the return to a pre-crisis development and growth path can be con-sidered as a point of reference. A definition for the economic context must also take into account that a national economy represents a system deter-mined by a multiplicity of actors at various levels, along with their interactions. In this regard, social interdepend-3 A definition of the term for the   economic-policy context Measured against the foregoing conceptual clarifications, current definitions of resilience within the economic-policy context (to the extent use of the term is even accompanied by such definitions) are far from satisfying. A one-dimensional macroeconomic conception of resilience is dominant among international institutions. A Bank for International Settlements paper (BIS 2016: 1) released for the autumn 2016 G-20 meeting says: for example “A resil-ient economy is a natural policy aspiration. One aspect of resilience is an economy’s capacity to absorb and quickly recover from adverse shocks, containing their impact on output and employment.” The formulation in a current working paper from the European Central Bank is similar: “Resilience is understood here as the capacity to minimize output losses once an adverse shock hits the economy” (Sondermann 2016: 2). This equation of resilience with the neutralization of growth and employment consequences, while broadly ignoring the dynamic, adaptive dimension, is not atypical of the term’s use at the level of the interna-tional economic-policy coordinating bodies. There is also a lack of any reflection as to how performance after a cri-sis can be assessed. To be sure, a simple growth criteria is operationally useful, but today fails to resonate with com-prehensive societal objective functions. In addition, terminological confusion is evident between resilience in the above-developed interdisciplinary under-standing and the reflections on crisis prevention such as that contained in the following definition from an OECD working paper: “Economic resilience can be defined as the capacity of an economy to reduce vulnerabilities, to resist to shocks and to recover quickly. It can be strengthened by exploring the role of policies that mitigate both the risks and consequences of severe crises” (Caldera Sánchez et al. 2016: 6). Under this understanding, the avoidance of crises is a part of a resilience strategy, in contrast to the inter-disciplinary use of the term. This macroeconomic literature considers the use of certain indicators as an early-warning system for impending crises (Hermansen and Röhn 2015), 13Economic resilienceencies and the decision processes within the political sys-tem play a role, as do the decision-making behaviors of individuals as voters, consumers or entrepreneurs. A com-prehensive definition must include these different levels. A definitionAgainst this background, the following definition appears suitable as a starting point for a comprehensive econom-ic-policy resilience strategy: This definition captures the contents of the resilience con-cept that are essential in the economic context, includ-ing the proactive and adaptive dimension. In addition, the formulation makes it clear that the resilience of an eco-nomic system is determined through the interplay of dif-ferent levels. The societal objective function referred to in the definition is a placeholder that must be filled on the basis of the relevant regional and historical context, and which is to be determined through a democratic deci-sion-making process. In this regard, it may be that adjust-ments in the objective function itself may figure into the crisis-driven adaptations. In the context of today’s German Definition of economic resilienceEconomic resilience is the capability of an national  economy to take preparatory crisis-management  measures, mitigate the direct consequences of crises,  and adapt to changing circumstances. In this regard, the degree of resilience will be determined by how well the actions and interplay of the political, economic and societal spheres can safeguard the performance of the economy – as measured against the societal objective function – also after a crisis. and European economic policy, the objective function could be described using the concepts of inclusive and sustainable growth, and operationalized accordingly. 14Economic resilience• Strengthen existing crisis-management capabilities,• Take the various crisis phases (preparation, mitigation and adaptation) into account, and• Address the various levels (politics, economy, society), including their interplay.  In the literature, a distinction is made between “exog-enous” and “endogenous” types of crisis-manage-ment capabilities (Rose 2016). The former describe exist-ing resources available in the short term (such as natural resources, human capital, infrastructure or financial reserves). The latter, closely related to the adaptive dimen-sion of resilience, take into account an economy’s reform competences, which are furthered through flexible insti-Writing on the concept of resilience, Swanstrom ren-ders the following judgement: “[R]esilience is more than a metaphor but less than a theory. At best it is a concep-tual framework […]” (Swanstrom 2008: 2). This may be a realistic appraisal of the added value possible for this con-cept of comparatively recent vintage within the field of economic policy. A precise and fully fleshed-out idea of resilience offers a conception that can take on a directive function if societies want to prepare themselves for una-voidable crises. The dimensions that such a resilience strategy must cover are set out in the above definition. In this respect, a strong resilience strategy must aim to: FIGURE 2: Dimensions of a resilience strategy4 Dimensions of a comprehensive   resilience strategySource: Own representation.  Factors’ susceptibility  to influenceExogenous(Reform competences)Endogenous(Resources)Societal actor levelsTemporal dimension /  impact phasesAdaptationMitigationPreparationPoliticsEconomySociety15Ökonomische Resilienz tutions, workers and businesses, as well as by a high level of social capital (mutual trust, networking). However, the “exogenous” resources in a proactive resilience strategy are not truly exogenous; they can be consciously augmented in order to be available in times of shortages caused by crises. The three temporal phases encompass the time before (preparation), during (mitigation) and after the crisis (adaptation). During the crisis, the focus is on maintain-ing the greatest degree of functionality possible, as well as on avoiding dramatic declines in employment, growth or development; some adjustments are also already conceiva-ble at this point. No matter how the various levels are ultimately specified,  every comprehensive strategy must include both the micro level (for example, workers’ readiness and capabil-ity to adapt) and the macro level (such as the state’s fiscal maneuvering room). The aim of such a comprehensive resilience strategy is to positively influence performance (with reference to the social definition of objectives) both during and after a  crisis. A permanently poorer performance (trend line (3)  in Figure 3) will be avoided to the greatest extent possible, the consequences of the shock will be permanently neutral-FIGURE 3: Performance under conditions of a crisisized (trend line (2)), or − in the ideal case − the crisis will even be used to transition to a higher path (trend line (1)). Type of crisis If a resilience strategy is specified, then ultimately the type of shock the strategy is meant to address must also be identified. With a view to the crisis years of the recent past, this could include banking, financial, real-estate, debt and currency crises with their various cross-border effects, or a global growth decline triggered by any other cause which is associated with a slump in national export performance. With regard to all crisis-specific aspects, there should ulti-mately be a large field of resilience-promoting factors that collectively increase resilience for many different types of crisis. Examples include (with regard to resources) the state of public finances, and with regard to reform competences, the degree of flexibility and openness to change among workers and voters.

What strategies for improving resilience can be implemen-ted here, and which are most promising? Questions such as these remain largely unanswered today, and point the way to an extensive need for future research.  If the concept of resilience is developed comprehensively, and is not simply forced into service as no more than a new label on well-worn messages, then it holds economic-policy potential as a kind of new compass. This is because the question of how national economies can increase their crisis-handling capabilities across their various levels is of great importance in our era of multiple crises. However, the limitations of the new conceptualization must be observed. The considerable enthusiasm for resilience as a concept should not lead to misconceiving this term as a replacement for the formulation of societal objectives. As stated, the extent of a country’s economic resilience can only be assessed in the light of a previously determined societal objective function; without identifying goals, for instance with regard to growth and distribution, the term remains only an empty husk. Against this background, it is no accident that the vogue for the concept of resilience has coincided with the demand for inclusive growth − that is, a growth that links economic dynamism with participation opportunities for all popu-lation groups. If a crisis does occur, the associated con-sequences are potentially serious for the socially wea-ker groups within a society. On the one hand, these groups have few opportunities to absorb income fluctuations; on the other, an economic crisis is often accompanied by decreases in the government’s capability to engage in social redistribution. One of the goals of an economic policy obli-gated to pursue inclusive growth must thus be to seek means of managing crises that ensure that the objectives of inclusive growth are compromised as little as possible. The gaps in knowledge today remain as large as resilience’s entry into the lexicon of economics is recent. How does res-ilience differ within various European countries with res-pect to various types of shocks? What types of resilience can be distinguished on the basis of different societal objecti-ves?

But looking solely at economic growth is deceptive. Growth in recent years has not been inclusive, as participa‑tion opportunities have become increasingly une‑qually distributed. This puts social cohesion at risk. But what might policies that achieve both goals—realizing growth potential and expanding partici ‑pation opportunities—look like? As a part of its “Strategies and Investments for Inclusive Growth” project, the Bertelsmann Stiftung develops and discusses concrete recommendations for an inclusive growth model. Using current research as a basis, this discussion paper discusses the degree to which the entrepreneurial activity of immigrants and people with a migrant background are today already serving to drive inclusive growth in Germany, and how potential of this kind can be identified.The conditions rendering it possible to engage in entre‑pre neurial activity in a country have a direct effect even beyond that country’s national economic perfor‑mance. Who founds companies and who does not, and the degree of sustainability displayed by the com‑panies founded, says much about how participation opportunities are distributed within a society. Are conditions such that groups that still lack full equality of opportunity within economic processes, such as women, young people, and people with an experience of immigration or a migrant background, are able as businesspeople to become pace‑setters for a suc‑cessful economy? Or is their potential overlooked and unused? What specific obstacles are in place?

The German economy is as strong as ever. But growth in recent years has not been inclusive. Inequalities between groups of people, generations and regions have increased. In order to ensure the continuing success of the social-mar-ket-economy model, we must we must rethink the relationship between growth and a socially inclu-sive society. The series contributes to this impor-tant debate by analyzing current developments and offering feasible recommendations for action.  Following the tradition of its founder, Reinhard Mohn, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is committed to the common welfare. It sees itself as an agent of social change, and supports the goal of a sus-tainable society. The Stiftung is independent and non-partisan.Inclusive Growthwww.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/inklusives-wachstumBlog: New Perspectives on GlobalEconomic Dynamicshttp://ged-project.deSustainable Governance Indicatorswww.sgi-network.orgTwitter: https://twitter.com/BertelsmannStFacebook: www.facebook.com/BertelsmannStiftungImprint  © July 2017,Bertelsmann Stiftung, GüterslohBertelsmann StiftungCarl-Bertelsmann-Straße 25633311 GüterslohPhone +49 5241 81-0www.bertelsmann-stiftung.deResponsibleDr. Henrik Brinkmann  Bertelsmann Stiftung henrik.brinkmann@ bertelsmann-stiftung.deAuthorsDr. Henrik Brinkmann,  Bertelsmann StiftungChristoph Harendt, ZEW MannheimProf. Dr. Friedrich Heinemann,  ZEW Mannheim and University  of HeidelbergJustus Nover, ZEW MannheimTranslationBarbara Serfozo DesignDietlind Ehlers, BielefeldPhotosShutterstock / kldyISSN 2365-8991Address | ContactBertelsmann Stiftung Carl-Bertelsmann-Straße 256 33311 Gütersloh Phone +49 5241 81-0Dr. Henrik BrinkmannProgram “Shaping Sustainable Economies”Phone +49 5241 81-81567henrik.brinkmann@bertelsmann-stiftung.dewww.bertelsmann-stiftung.de
