Clair Ridge will be the world’s first offshore deployment of BP’s LoSal EOR technology. The method will be implemented as a day one, secondary waterflood and is expected to deliver an additional 42 million barrels, at a cost of only 3 $/bbl. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant growth in the evidence supporting the technology, but there is a limited amount of papers where the profitability of the method is discussed.  Profitability is the primary driver of any project. Thus, the objective of this thesis is to evaluate the profitability of LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge, and contribute to an improved insight in to the economics of EOR. This is done by combining both technical and economic aspects of the Clair Ridge project. Through a literature review of the reservoir mechanisms and deployment of EOR projects, three main challenges are identified: technical, managerial and economic.  The economic challenges are further analyzed by calculating the differential cash flow from the Clair Ridge field. The project’s net present value (NPV) is also obtained and evaluated. The results indicate that LoSal EOR is profitable under the given assumptions and circumstances. Additionally, scenarios including traditional waterflooding and tertiary EOR are investigated to illustrate the added value of LoSal EOR. From the observed results, it is clear that LoSal EOR is the preferred project.  Finally, the effects of delayed production peak and timing of EOR investments are discussed. Although production curves and cash flows are strongly related, it is found that a delay in production peak has a minor effect on NPV. However, results show that an investment made early in the lifetime of the field has a favorable influence on NPV. Hence, it is strongly recommended to include an EOR strategy from the beginning of the field development.       ii  Table of Contents Abstract .................................................................................................................................................. i Table of Contents ................................................................................................................................. ii List of Figures ...................................................................................................................................... iv List of Tables ....................................................................................................................................... vi Preface ................................................................................................................................................. vii Abbreviations and Acronyms .......................................................................................................... viii 1.

My interest in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) started through my bachelor degree in Petroleum Technology, and was deepened throughout my bachelor thesis where experimental studies of EOR were performed. An emerging EOR method with great potential is low salinity water injection. However, there exist few economic evaluations of this method. This motivated me to combine my knowledge within petroleum technology and economics to investigate this topic. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my faculty supervisor, Petter Osmundsen. His guidance, input and enthusiasm has been very helpful and motivating throughout the work with this thesis. Special thanks also go to Skule Strand, for introducing me to the Clair Ridge field and always welcoming me to ask questions. Finally, I would like to thank all my friends at the University of Stavanger, and especially INDØKS, for making these five years the very best.    viii  Abbreviations and Acronyms $bn One billion dollars $mm One million dollars b/d Barrels per day bbl US oil barrel CAPEX Capital expenditure COP Cessation of production cP Centipoise EOR Enhanced oil recovery HS High salinity HSWI High salinity water injection IEA International energy agency IOR  Improved oil recovery LS Low salinity LSE Low salinity effect LSWI Low salinity water injection Mbbl One thousand barrels mD Millidarcy MMbbl One million barrels NPV Net present value OOIP Original oil in place OPEX Operational expenditure PV Pore volume PWRI Produced water re-injection SWCTT Single well chemical tracer tests UKCS United Kingdom continental shelf Introduction 1  1. Introduction  Profitability is the primary driver of any project. It justifies the project implementation, and governs its processes and design (Hite et al., 2005). For many years, almost any project in the oil and gas industry seemed to be profitable, and with an increasing oil demand, many companies were eager to invest in new technology. Today, alongside falling oil prices, there is no guarantee that projects will be profitable, and companies are less willing to take risks. The main focus is on maximizing the recovery factor from current oil fields, as well as maintaining an economic oil rate (Muggeridge et al., 2014). In the Market Report Series: Oil 2017, the International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that the global oil and gas upstream investment fell by 25 % in 2015, and by another 26 % in 2016. However, 2015 also became the biggest year-on-year growth since the financial crisis, with a growth in demand of 2,0 million b/d. Followed by a very robust growth of 1,6 million b/d in 2016, IEA still expects a steady growth in oil demand. Given this increase in demand, and the fact that the average oil recovery factor per reservoir is only 20 % to 40 %, increasing the amount of oil produced from existing and future fields is essential (IEA, 2017). Enhanced oil recovery, or simply EOR, seeks to do just that. Conventional methods use reservoir energy and re-pressurizing by gas- and water-injection to recover trapped oil. EOR-methods, on the other hand, alter the reservoir’s properties to persuade the rock to give up more of its resources. Low salinity water injection (LSWI) is an EOR-method that floods the reservoir using water with total dissolved solids content less than 5,000 ppm (Robbana et al., 2012). The method is widely known, and over the last twenty years, numerous experimental evidences of increased oil recovery by LSWI have been published. Yet, very few economic evaluations of this method are currently available. 1.1 Objectives The objective of this thesis is to investigate the profitability of enhanced oil recovery at the Clair Ridge field, UK. The field is selected due to several reasons. First, Clair Ridge is the world’s first full-field deployment of BP’s LoSal EOR water injection technology. Second, the method is adopted as a day one, secondary waterflood, which has several advantages compared to a traditional tertiary EOR processes. Third and finally, the method is expected to be very cost effective with an additional cost of only $3 per barrel. Through differential cash flow analysis, the project’s net present value (NPV) is obtained and evaluated. Scenarios including traditional waterflooding and tertiary EOR are also analyzed to illustrate the added value of LoSal EOR. Hence, this thesis aims to evaluate the profitability of LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge, and contribute to an improved insight in to the economics of EOR.   Introduction 2  1.2 The Clair Ridge Field The Clair field is located 142 miles north of the Scottish mainland and 35 miles west of the Shetland Island. The field extends over an area of 220 km2, in water depths of 132 m to 155 m. Clair is the largest oil accumulation in the United Kingdom continental shelf (UKCS), and contains over 6 billion barrels of oil in place. Operator of the field is BP (27,62 %), and partners are ConocoPhilips (24 %), Chevron North Sea (19,42 %), Enterprise Oil (18,68 %), Shell Clair UK (9,3 %) and Britoil (0,98 %) (Wilson, 2014). Clair was originally discovered in 1977, but due to complex conditions such as a tight sandstone reservoir (50 mD average), a relatively viscous oil (3,2 cP) and a harsh North Atlantic environment, the appraisal period was long. Because of the physical size of Clair, the field is developed through a phased approach. Phase one came on stream February 2005, and has up till now produced over 100 billion barrels. The success at Clair Phase 1, paved way for the much larger second phase, Clair Ridge (BP, 2017b).  Clair Ridge is planned to target the part of the field to the north of Clair Phase 1, and is estimated to produce 640 million barrels of oil over a 40-year period. By implementing LoSal EOR from day one, an extra 42 million barrels are expected to be recovered cost-effectively from the field during its lifetime. Facilities (two bridge-linked platforms) were installed during 2013-2016, and the first oil is expected in the beginning of 2018 (BP, 2015). Figure 1.1 illustrates the location of the Clair field, and other BP operated fields in the same area.  Figure 1.1 Location of the Clair field and other BP operated fields in the North Sea  (BP, 2017b). Theory  3  2. Theory N.B. 1: Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 are retrieved from Layti (2015). (Layti, 2015) N.B. 2: LoSal EOR is a trademark of BP p.l.c.  2.1 Oil Recovery Oil recovery is referred to as the processes by which crude oil is extracted from reservoirs beneath the Earth’s surface. The main goal of the process is to produce oil as long as it is environmentally and economically feasible. 2.1.1 Traditional Oil Recovery Traditionally, oil recovery has been divided into three groups: primary recovery, secondary recovery and tertiary recovery. These groups describe the recovery process in a chronological order.  The initial production stage is primary recovery. Primary recovery results from the use of natural energy existing in a reservoir, as the main source of energy to displace the oil. These natural energy drive mechanisms are solution-gas drive, gas-cap drive, natural water-drive, fluid and rock expansion, and gravity drainage (Green & Willhite, 1998). As the reservoir pressure declines because of production, artificial lift systems such as rod pumps, electrical submersible pumps or gas-lift installations can be implemented. At this production stage, 5 % to 10 % of the original oil in place (OOIP) is recovered (Schlumberger, 2015). Secondary recovery is the second stage of oil recovery. This stage is traditionally implemented after primary production declines or is too low for economic oil recovery. The main purpose is to re–pressurize the reservoir by adding external energy. This process involves high pressure maintenance by waterflooding or gas injection (Green & Willhite, 1998). Waterflooding gives pressure support to the reservoir to prevent gas production, and to displace the oil by viscous forces (Austad, 2012). Secondary recovery can allow extraction of additional 10 % to 20 % of the oil. After primary and secondary recovery, about two thirds of the original oil in place is left trapped in the reservoir (Van't Veld & Phillips, 2010). Tertiary recovery, the third stage of production, is applied after secondary recovery processes are ineffective, uneconomical or no longer qualified. The process uses different injectors such as miscible gases, chemicals and/or thermal energy to improve the flow and displace additional crude oil from the reservoir (Green & Willhite, 1998). Theory  4  2.1.2 Enhanced Oil Recovery Today, tertiary recovery processes are often referred to, and more accepted as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. Enhanced oil recovery is not restricted to a particular producing life period of the reservoir, and can be initiated with primary or secondary recovery processes (Green & Willhite, 1998). EOR refers to oil recovery processes other than natural reservoir energy and re-pressurization of the reservoir. The processes involve injection of a fluid or fluids that alter the original properties of the reservoir, and creates favorable conditions for oil recovery. Typical injectors include chemical liquids and gases such as hydrocarbon gases, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, flue gases and/or thermal energy (Green & Willhite, 1998). The term improved oil recovery (IOR) is also frequently used. IOR refers to any practice used to increase the oil recovery and includes EOR, secondary recovery, infill drilling and horizontal wells (Stosur et al., 2003). Figure 2.1 shows a schematic overview over widely used recovery processes, and the proposed definitions of EOR and IOR.    Figure 2.1 Proposed definitions of the EOR and IOR terms (Stosur et al., 2003). Nowadays, conventional oil resources are maturing and new giant oil fields are becoming increasingly difficult to find. There are huge volumes of unconventional hydrocarbons, such as very viscous oil and gas hydrates, but the technologies to recover these resources are either too energy consuming, environmentally sensitive or not ready to be applied in field (Muggeridge et al., 2014). Thus, enhanced oil recovery is essential to maintain the existing oil reserves and improve production rates. Theory  5  2.1.3 Waterflooding As an EOR Method Oil and gas are produced by creating pressure gradients within the reservoir that cause the oil and/or gas to flow towards one or more production wells. Normally these pressure gradients are sustained by injecting water or gas into the reservoir through injection wells. Waterflooding physically displaces the oil, and takes its place in the pore space (Muggeridge et al., 2014). The technique has proved to be widely successful over a range of reservoirs and conditions, and is currently the preferred technique for most projects. Waterflooding has also brought solutions to problems regarding water treatment, corrosion control, water handling, sand production and waste water disposal (Wade, 1971).  In a normal waterflooding process, reservoir properties are not altered, thus the recovery method is considered as secondary recovery. However, if the composition of the injected water is modified, e.g. by lowering the salinity or adding chemicals, the initial reservoir properties may change. Therefore, waterflooding may also fall into the EOR category (Torrijos, 2017). 2.1.4 Emerging Enhanced Oil Recovery Technologies As figure 2.1 illustrates, EOR processes can be classified in three categories: Thermal, gas miscible/immiscible and chemical & others. However, a fourth category, emerging processes, is also often included. Emerging EOR processes include low salinity water injection, microbial EOR, enzymatic EOR and Nano particles, among others. These methods apply rather different mechanisms than the conventional EOR processes to improve oil recovery. Emerging EOR processes also benefit from significantly lower costs per barrel, have a broader applicability and are less complex to implement (Muggeridge et al., 2014).   2.2 Low Salinity Water Injection As mentioned, one of the emerging enhanced oil recovery technologies is low salinity water injection (LSWI). The purpose of LSWI is to inject water with a reduced salinity (less than 5,000 ppm) to improve oil recovery. LSWI is a relatively new method, yet very attractive due to its simple, inexpensive and environmentally friendly implementation (Dang et al., 2013). However, the method has not yet been implemented in full scale, even though the first experimental evidence of increased oil recovery by low salinity water injection was reported more than twenty years ago. In this section, the proposed mechanisms for LSWI in sandstone reservoirs, and the process of getting LoSal EOR from laboratory experiments to full field deployment are presented.   Theory  6  2.2.1 The Low Salinity Effect Jadhunandan (1990) and Jadhunandan and Morrow (1995) were the first to document the effect of brine composition on waterflooding, and in 1996, Yildiz and Morrow published the first coreflood results. The authors concluded that the composition of the injected water can affect recovery, but that further work was needed to distinguish the relative importance of crude oil, brine and rock chemistry (Yildiz & Morrow, 1996). Trough continuous investigation, the low salinity effect was discovered by Tang and Morrow (1997). In their study of Berea sandstone cores, it was documented that the salinity of the injected brine had a major influence on wettability and oil recovery (Tang & Morrow, 1997). Following, extensive research programs on low salinity water injection have been conducted by Webb et al. (2004) and McGuire et al. (2005). Both programs conducted LSWI single well tests, and similar favorable results were obtained (McGuire et al., 2005; Webb et al., 2004). Today, it is generally accepted that the reason for this improved oil recovery is due to wettability alteration (Webb et al., 2004). Wettability is closely linked to the distribution of oil and brine in the pores of the rock, and wetting properties are found to play a very important role for the efficiency of waterfloods in reservoirs (Austad, 2012). Reservoirs are defined as water-wet, mixed-wet or oil-wet, and usually the initial wetting is not optimal for oil recovery (Fathi et al., 2011). However, the wettability can be improved (towards more water-wet conditions) by injecting low salinity water.  The proposed mechanisms for this wettability improvement include the low salinity water weakening the polar attraction of crude oil to clay particles in the rock. As the oil migrates through the reservoir rock, polar organic components in the crude oil are adsorbed to the surface (see figure 2.2). In several cases, the mechanism by which polar components involve cation bridges. The low salinity water is able to break these bridges by exchanging the divalent cation (Ca2+, Mg2+) for a monovalent cation such as sodium (Na+). Consequently, the oil molecules are freed to be swept towards the producing wells. This mechanism is referred to as multicomponent ion exchange (MIE) and is illustrated in figure 2.3 (Lager, Webb, Black, et al., 2008; Robbana et al., 2012). Understanding low salinity water injection is essential to develop a successful EOR method. Still, the mechanisms for the increased production are not well understood. Other proposed low salinity EOR mechanisms include fines migration (Tang & Morrow, 1999), pH variation (McGuire et al., 2005) and the smart water LS mechanism (Austad et al., 2010). Nevertheless, all the interest in the low salinity effect have led to a better understanding, and enabled the world’s first full field implementation of low salinity water injection at the Clair Ridge field. Theory  7   Figure 2.2 Attraction mechanisms between crude oil and rock surface (Robbana et al., 2012).

Re-drawn after (Zekri et al., 2011). Theory  8  2.2.2 From Laboratory Research to Field Implementation BP’s low salinity technology is named LoSal EOR, and is developed by BP’s Pushing Reservoir Limits team. The deployment of LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge is a combination of a decade of testing in BP’s laboratories and oil field trials in Alaska (BP, 2014). Figure 2.4 shows a typical timeline for EOR development projects.  Figure 2.4 EOR development timeline. Re-drawn after (Maersk Oil, 2017). Per figure 2.4, it can take more than 10 years from screening and design of an EOR project to full field expansion. As an example, the confirmation and quantification of the LoSal EOR potential began in 2006, and the first oil from the project is expected at the beginning of 2018 (Robbana et al., 2012).  EOR Screening  Choosing an appropriate EOR process for a targeted oil field is a critical decision. Typical screening criteria to be considered include oil viscosity, oil gravity, saturation, formation type, permeability, previous production method, etc. In addition to these reservoir-specific criteria, offshore-specific conditions such as higher costs, remote location, space and weight limitations, and environmental regulations must be included (Kang et al., 2014). Furthermore, an economic screen, where the chosen EOR method is applied to a representative model reservoir, should be conducted  (Bondor, 1993).  During the development of Clair Ridge, various EOR schemes, e.g. gas flooding, CO2 flooding and polymer flooding, were considered and rejected. Since water naturally imbibes into the Clair rock formation, it was concluded that an EOR method based on water would offer the best solution. A successful LSWI should be designed in such a way that additional oil is generated, while risks such as formation damage and clay swelling are avoided under any condition (Sorop et al., 2013). With limited reservoir information, this could be a challenging and complex process (Green & Willhite, 1998).  Theory  9  Laboratory Testing Once a suitable EOR scheme is chosen, extensive laboratory testing is initiated. The performance of LoSal EOR can be simulated at core, well or sector scale (shown in figure 2.5). At core scale, corefloods under reservoir conditions are performed to understand mechanisms and evaluate displacement behavior of the injected water (Green & Willhite, 1998). Next, single well chemical tracer tests (SWCTT) are conducted to measure residual oil saturation in the near-well region (Huseby et al., 2012). In total, over 50 corefloods and over 15 SWCTTs have been conducted by BP across its portfolio to confirm the performance  of LoSal EOR (Reddick et al., 2012).  Finally, at the sector scale, fine grid 3D models of pilot area, EOR forecast scenarios and scaling of low salinity parameters are investigated (Rotondi et al., 2014). Robbana et. al (2012) created 48 sector models to analyze LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge. Of all the reservoir descriptions tested, 98 % had a positive LoSal EOR incremental recovery (Robbana et al., 2012).   Figure 2.5 Simulation modelling steps. 1. core scale, 2. well scale and 3. sector scale. Re-drawn after (Rotondi et al., 2014). Example figures are collected from (Robbana et al., 2012; Seccombe et al., 2008).  Pilot Development and Execution To gain a better understanding of important parameters and variables a field test or pilot may be necessary. Factors such as injectivity, residual-oil saturation and displacement efficiency can be hard to measure in the laboratory or difficult to deduce from history matching. If these factors are critical for success, a field test is often justified. The results from a pilot can be used to further improve performance models, and in economic studies to help management make smart decisions (Hite et al., 2005).  Theory  10  Prior to the Clair Ridge project, a field trial using LoSal EOR at the Edicott Field, Alaska was conducted. The trial confirmed that low salinity water injection works as well at inter-well distances as it does in corefloods and single well chemical tracer tests (Seccombe et al., 2008). A second field trial performed by BP, also concluded that injection of low salinity brine was successful (Lager, Webb, Collins, et al., 2008). The stages from corefloods in the laboratory to pilots in the field are essential in building confidence and proof for the LoSal EOR technology. This is often referred to as the “pyramid of proof”, illustrated in figure 2.6.   Figure 2.6 Pyramid of proof and typical costs. Re-drawn after (Reddick, 2012). The pyramid of proof illustrates the importance and contribution of each stage in collecting subsurface data and knowledge to enable LoSal EOR technology. In addition, the typical costs for each stage are included (Reddick, 2012). Facilities Installation When facilities are designed to be installed offshore, all increases in seawater capacity, installed equipment and overall system complexity should be kept to a minimum. The facilities on the Clair Ridge project include two new bridge-linked platforms; a production platform and a utilities platform. Additionally, a new pipeline infrastructure is constructed to connect storage and redelivery facilities on Shetland. To manufacture the low salinity water, desalination facilities based on reverse osmosis with membrane prefiltration are installed (Reddick et al., 2012). Figure 2.7 illustrates the integration of membrane treatment facilities into conventional offshore water injection systems.  Theory  11   Figure 2.7 Integration of membrane treatment facilities into conventional offshore water injection systems (Reddick et al., 2012). Water is pumped up from the sea, and transported towards membrane pretreatment and membrane desalination where the salinity is reduced. Separated produced water and reduced salinity water streams make it possible to manage the water injection into isolated field segments over time, so that LoSal EOR reservoir contact is maximized (Robbana et al., 2012). Full Field EOR Development Normally EOR projects are developed as tertiary recovery processes. However, research show that oil recovery in some cases are increased significantly if LSWI is applied as a secondary waterflood (Hamon, 2016).  In addition, it is strongly recommended to include an EOR strategy in the development plan of the reservoir in order to get a more efficient EOR project (Strand, 2005).  Clair Ridge will be the first offshore development project to implement LoSal EOR as a secondary recovery. Furthermore, the project aims to re-inject produced water into the reservoir, and thus become more environmentally friendly by not disposing any produced water to the sea. (Robbana et al., 2012). Figure 2.8 illustrates the LoSal EOR flood segments and injection strategy at Clair Ridge.  Theory  12   Figure 2.8 Clair Ridge LoSal flood segments (Robbana et al., 2012). From day one of production, segments 1 and 2 will be flooded with low salinity water. Once sufficient LoSal water has been injected to deliver secondary EOR, the segments will be switched to produced water re-injection (PWRI). Segment 3 will start with PWRI, and then receive low salinity water after year 2030. Segment 4 will be flooded with produced water throughout the lifetime of waterflood (Robbana et al., 2012). Finally, even though the most critical part of a project lies in its early phases, the job is not completed once the production valves are turned on. To ensure a successful EOR project, ongoing surveillance of the process is essential. Reliable data, careful quality control, monitoring performance and frequent well reviews play a strong role in achieving production targets (Hite et al., 2005). 2.3 Deployment of EOR Projects In addition to increased oil recovery and direct economic value, there are several advantages linked to low salinity water injection EOR. First, the method has lower CAPEX and OPEX costs than alternative EOR technologies. Second, risks regarding reservoir souring, formation damage, scaling and corrosion may be reduced (Sorop et al., 2013). Third, by extending the field life of current fields, the need for new field developments may be reduced (Thompson & Goodyear, 2001). Despite these benefits and the fact that EOR methods nowadays are more cost-efficient than ever, the deployment of commercial EOR projects is slow. The main inhibiting factors include technical, managerial and economical challenges (Torrijos, 2017). Theory  13  2.3.1 Technical Challenges As described in section 2.2.2, one of the main bottlenecks in the deployment of new technology is transforming the techniques and methods from the laboratory to field implementation (Osmundsen, 2013). There are several reasons for this in EOR projects. Foremost, no single EOR process is applicable to all oil types, and so, several different processes must be developed. Following, oil resources exist in reservoirs of widely varying characteristics. Rock type, structure and other geological parameters are unique for every reservoir, and thus every deployment of an EOR method is unique (Green & Willhite, 1998).  Another major project stopper are the technical challenges related to offshore installation.  As mentioned, offshore installations have strict capacity limitations, and reconstructions can be difficult and expensive. In addition, offshore installations have often less injection wells, which causes a greater distance between each well. This can result in a less efficient flooding, and a longer payback period due to the delayed effect of EOR. Offshore projects also require reliable prognoses, but obtaining proper data on reservoir conditions is usually expensive and time-consuming (Søndenå & Henriquez, 2011). 2.3.2 Managerial Challenges and Risks Low salinity water injection is normally an extension of conventional waterflooding, and thus easier to implement than other EOR methods. However, the screening, designing and executing phases require an increased operator competence and management focus compared to conventional waterflooding (Sorop et al., 2013). Additionally, EOR projects are often held back because the perceived balance between risk and reward is not considered to be competitive compared to other more conventional recovery methods (Thompson & Goodyear, 2001). To overcome this “conservativeness” in applying new technology, long term commitment from management to mature the technology is necessary (Sorop et al., 2013). Being able to identify and manage risk is an important step in achieving recognition and acceptance towards new technology. Reddick (2012) identified the main risks associated to LoSal EOR to be loss of injectivity, operability of desalination facilities and the interface with produced water management. Through a risk management analysis, illustrated in figure 2.9, most of the risks were found to be of relatively low or medium impact and/or frequency. A small number of potentially high impact risks were found. However, these relate to design decisions and become highly manageable with project maturity and definition (Reddick et al., 2012).  Theory  14   Figure 2.9 Risk assessment for low salinity projects. Re-drawn after (Reddick et al., 2012).  2.3.3 Economic Challenges Besides the internal project economics, the decision on whether to implement EOR is highly dependent on the external market conditions, such as the oil price. As an example of this dependency, most of the EOR processes used today were first introduced in the early 1970s at a time of relatively high oil prices (Muggeridge et al., 2014). Another challenge is that many EOR projects are capital sensitive with high risk of undesirable consequences (Kang et al., 2014).  Onshore EOR projects in the North America have been relatively common for many years, while offshore EOR projects are much less common. Costs of implementing EOR offshore are much higher than in an onshore environment, and this have been one of the main inhibiting factors for EOR in the UKCS (Muggeridge et al., 2014). To overcome the high costs of offshore oil development, the size of the targeted oil fields is generally large. Thus, the amount of recoverable oil using EOR is enormous (Kang et al., 2014). Another positive aspect of offshore EOR implementation is the availability of seawater, which makes waterflooding relatively cheap (Muggeridge et al., 2014).  One more important factor to recognize is that the direct income from the additional oil production due to EOR may not in itself be enough to make a project economic. However, the window created by extended platform life from an EOR project, might create additional recovery from satellite fields, and therefore be profitable  (Thompson & Goodyear, 2001).  Theory  15  2.4 Economics of EOR Today, EOR projects must prove themselves under much more strict criteria than previously (Bondor, 1993). Consequently, in order to be successful, economic studies are performed in parallel with engineering design and performance models (Hite et al., 2005). This ensures that factors that have a significant influence on profitability are given extra attention, so that the project is kept within budget.  2.4.1 How to Measure Profitability? There are several methods to measure the profitability and to rank multiple projects.  The Time Value of Money One of the most basic principles of finance is the time value of money: A dollar received today is worth more than a dollar received in the future, because the dollar today can be invested to earn more than a dollar received in the future. This principle is also fundamental in an EOR project since the future oil production rate is translated into future cash flows, which in turn is related to an investment decision in the present (Joshi et al., 1998). To calculate the present value of money, the cash flow is multiplied by a discount factor. The discount factor is given by equation 1 (Joshi et al., 1998): 𝐷𝐹𝑖 =1(1 + 𝑟)𝑡 (1) Where r is the discount rate and t is years from now. The discount factor is always less than 1. If there are a series of delayed cash flows over a given time, their present value is (Joshi et al., 1998): 𝑃𝑉 = ∑ 𝐷𝐹𝑖 ∗  𝐶𝑖𝑛𝑖=1 (2) Where Ci is the cash flow at times ti. Net Present Value To make decisions when cash flows are received at different points in time, the net present value (NPV) is calculated. The NPV is obtained by adding the initial cash flow (investments) to the PV formula (equation 2) (Joshi et al., 1998): 𝑁𝑃𝑉 =  𝐶0 + 𝑃𝑉 (3) Where C0 is the initial cash flow. Theory  16  A project is said to be profitable if the NPV is larger or equal to zero, and unprofitable if it is less than zero (Albright et al., 2007).  Differential Cash Flow Cash flow is the yearly net amount of cash moving into and out of a business. To evaluate the profitability of EOR rather than traditional recovery, a differential cash flow analysis is conducted. In a differential cash flow, two mutually exclusive projects are compared by computing the difference in cash flows for each period between the two investments. By using this method, cost savings by choosing one option over another appear as revenue in the annual cash flow (Albright et al., 2007; Damodaran, 2010). Internal Rate of Return The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate which makes the NPV equal to zero. Generally, projects with higher IRR are chosen over projects with lower IRR. However, sometimes a project may not have a unique IRR, or not an IRR at all. Thus, NPV is more useful than IRR (Joshi et al., 1998). Method  17  3. Method This chapter describes methods for collecting data, estimating production and calculating cash flows. Figure 5.1 illustrates the steps and approaches used to obtain the results. Finally, some thoughts on uncertainty in the calculations are included.  Figure 3.1 Methodology of analysis.  3.1 Data Collection There are a limited amount of papers and reports where the profitability of BP’s LoSal EOR method is discussed. Thus, obtaining data to investigate the economic potential is even harder. However, Clair Ridge is the world’s first full-field deployment of LoSal EOR technology, and hence, BP has great interest in displaying it. A search for Clair Ridge on BP’s webpage bp.com results in 59 articles, while a search for other BP operated fields in the same area, such as Schiehallion and Foinaven (see figure 1.1), only show 33 and 5 results respectively.  More than 500 papers are published on low salinity water injection into sandstone reservoirs to enhance oil recovery, but very few field applications of the technique exist. Clair Ridge is therefore unique, and of great significance if the project successful. Several news articles are written about the project, and a search on Google Scholar for Clair Ridge gives more than 100 results. This shows that BP and the LoSal EOR technology have gained a lot of attention. However, few articles and papers investigates the economic aspect of the field.  3.2 Production Profiles First, to study the economic potential of Clair Ridge, production profiles are estimated. The data used in this thesis to develop production profiles are based on historical data from UK Oil and Gas Authority, published SPE papers and BP’s own statements. Until now, the Clair field (phase one) has produced over 100 million barrels, and reached a plateau of 50,000 barrels per day in 2007. Figure 3.2 shows the monthly oil production in cubic meters from 2004 to 2016. Method  18   Figure 3.2 Monthly oil production in m3 for Clair Ridge (2004-2016)(UK Oil and Gas Authority, 2017). Clair Ridge holds more than 640 million recoverable barrels, and is the largest oil accumulation in the UK continental shelf. First oil is expected in 2018, with production growing over four years to more than 100 thousand barrels per day. The employment of LoSal EOR technology is expected to result in 42 million additional barrels recovered over the lifetime of the field. It has taken BP over two decades of research to provide the confidence to deploy this technology at Clair Ridge. Several corefloods, well-tests and field trials have been performed to predict field performance from models and simulations (BP, 2014). Figure 3.3 illustrates a fracture-dominated LoSal EOR recovery type response, and is used as a base for the production curves in this thesis.  Figure 3.3 LoSal EOR oil recovery type profiles (Robbana et al., 2012). By using Excel and the collected data, production curves for different production scenarios at the Clair Ridge field is made. Tables 3.1 and 3.2 summarizes the data used for the calculations.   Monthly oil production [m3] Method  19  Table 3.1 Production data for Clair Ridge.

LoSal EOR Additional recovery [MMbbl] 42 Production peak reached [years after 1st inj.] 4  3.3 Investments and Cash Flows According to bp.com, the company has invested £4.5 billion in the Clair Ridge field (BP, 2011). This represents one of the highest annual investment ever made by BP in the UK North Sea. The project scope includes production, accommodation and drilling facilities on two bridge-linked platforms. In addition, the field will be tied into the existing export systems by new subsea pipelines. The investment also includes $120 million for a desalination unit to produce low salinity water. BP estimates the additional costs associated to producing and injecting low salinity water to be $3 per barrel (Reddick et al., 2012). It is assumed that the investment costs are equally spread over a four-year period starting in 2004, and production costs are kept constant over the lifetime of the field. To evaluate the profitability of LoSal EOR rather than traditional recovery, a differential cash flow with emphasis on net present value (NPV) is calculated. The model is based on a normal discount rate of 10 %. All calculations are done in real terms (2017). Accounting for the expected inflation of 2 %, a real discount rate of 8 % is applied. An oil price of $60 per barrel is assumed. Table 3.3 summarizes the data used in the calculations.  In computing differential cash flow, the project with the larger initial investment normally becomes the project against which the comparison is made (Damodaran, 2010). However, since the cash flows in this thesis are linked to production profiles, the project with larger total production becomes the project against which the comparison is made. Finally, the differential cash flows are used to calculate the NPV as described in section 2.4.1. The decision rule can be summarized as (Damodaran, 2010): Method  20  If NPVB-A > 0: Project B is better than project A  NPVB-A < 0: Project A is better than project B  Table 3.3 Economic data for Clair Ridge.  Data for NPV analysis  Investment costs [$bn]  7,1 LoSal investment cost [$mm]  120 Production cost LoSal EOR [$/bbl] 3 Oil price [$/bbl] 60 Discount rate [%] 8  3.4 Uncertainty The lack of theory on the economics of EOR makes it difficult to verify the collected data. Only two papers, SPE 153993 and SPE 161750, directly addressing LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge have been published. These papers mainly discuss the technical and operational aspects of the Clair Ridge project. As previously stated, most data have been collected from BP’s own articles and press releases. Even though BP is considered a reliable source, forward-looking statements such as capital expenditure, costs, investments, performance, hydrocarbon production volume etc. may contain errors. BP states in their legal notice and cautionary statement that: “Such statements reflect the views of BP as of the date made with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties. […] BP disclaims any intention or obligation to update forward looking statements (BP, 2017c).” Despite these uncertainties the collected data is quality controlled and compared to several published sources. The obtained results are also verified against similar studies. Production profiles are also a source of uncertainty. Since no modeling or simulation has been conducted, the profiles are based on forward-looking statements and other assumptions described in section 3.2. This is a weakness since all cash flows are based on these profiles, and thus will be influenced by an error. Yet, it does not exist a satisfactory simulation model for expected production from low salinity water injection today, and so a model based on forecasts is considered to the best alternative for this thesis. Results 21  4. Results The following results of are divided into three main parts. The first part presents the additional production profile and differential cash flow from LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge. In the second part, the most realistic option to EOR, a traditional secondary waterflooding, is assessed. Finally, a scenario with tertiary EOR, i.e. high salinity injection followed by a low salinity injection, is evaluated. Corresponding production curves and NPV for each scenario are also presented. All calculations are attached in the appendix.  4.1 Differential Cash Flow, the Profitability of LoSal EOR With the data shown in table 3.2 and assumptions presented in section 3.2, a production curve for the additional oil recovered by LoSal EOR, is estimated and presented in figure 4.1.  Figure 4.1 Additional production from LoSal EOR. The first oil from the field is expected in 2018, with a projected lifetime till 2050. Starting, the production has a steep increase, until the production peak is reached in 2022. Until this stage, only oil is produced. From 2022, the production significantly declines due to increasing water production. In total, LoSal EOR contributes with additional 42 million barrels. From the additional yearly production, the differential cash flow is calculated. Using only the investment for the LoSal EOR facilities, $120 million, and the additional costs of 3 $/bbl, the profitability of EOR alone is obtained. A discount rate of 8 % and oil price of 60 $/bbl, in real terms, have been chosen. Figure 4.2. shows the differential cash flow over time. Results 22   Figure 4.2 Differential cash flow for LoSal EOR.  During its first years, the Clair Ridge project has a negative cash flow, but as the production starts, the cash flow is positive throughout the lifetime. The shape of the cash flow columns follows the same shape as the curve in figure 4.1, suggesting that the cash flow is highly dependent on the production curve. From the differential cash flow, net present value of the project can be calculated: 𝑵𝑷𝑽𝑳𝒐𝑺𝒂𝒍 𝑬𝑶𝑹 =  $𝟔𝟗𝟕 𝟏𝟓𝟑 𝟖𝟓𝟓  The project is clearly profitable, with a NPV of $697 million.  4.2 Low Salinity Versus High Salinity Injection In the previous chapter, the profitability of LoSal EOR is evaluated based on the difference between implementing LoSal EOR and not implementing LoSal EOR. In a realistic case, the actual alternative to LoSal EOR, would be to perform a conventional high salinity water injection (HSWI). Studies comparing low salinity against high salinity injection show benefits ranging from 5 % to 40 % increased oil recovery based on original oil in place (Webb et al., 2008). Figure 4.3 illustrates a typical secondary high salinity and reduced salinity coreflood.  Results 23   Figure 4.3 Typical coreflood response – secondary recovery (Robbana et al., 2012). The positive effect of low salinity (LS) is clear as the reduced salinity flood curve reaches a higher oil plateau than the high salinity (HS) flood. Even more interesting, is the fact that after 0,5 PV the LS flood has produced 0,58 PV oil, while HS has only produced 0,46 PV. In other words, more oil is produced by injecting the same amount of water during LSWI compared to HSWI.  Based on figure 4.3, production scenarios (a) secondary LSWI and (b) secondary HSWI at Clair Ridge are estimated and presented in figure 4.4.   (a) Low Salinity water injection (LoSal EOR) (b) High salinity water injection Figure 4.4 Total production forecast at Clair Ridge.  Secondary HSWI maintains reservoir pressure, but does not alter the reservoir properties like LSWI, hence the two production curves in figure 4.4 are different. Scenario (a) shows that the oil production reaches a plateau of 30 million bbl/year in 2023, while (b) reaches the plateau in 2025 with a rate of approximately 22 million bbl/year. From the production curves, cash flow and NPV for the two scenarios are calculated. Table 4.1 presents the inputs used. Results 24  Table 4.1 Data used for LSWI and HSWI.  LSWI HSWI Difference  Investment  $5,80 billion $5,79 billion $120 million Production cost  8 $/bbl 5 $/bbl 3 $/bbl Total production 682 million bbl 532 million bbl 150 million bbl  Oil price of 60 $/bbl and discount rate of 8 % (real terms) are applied. The NPVs are:  𝑵𝑷𝑽𝑳𝑺𝑾𝑰 =  $𝟔 𝟎𝟔𝟑 𝟐𝟑𝟐 𝟐𝟑𝟏 𝑵𝑷𝑽𝑯𝑺𝑾𝑰 =  $𝟑 𝟑𝟗𝟗 𝟐𝟑𝟑 𝟒𝟏𝟑  Even with very large investments, both NPVLSWI and NPVHSWI are positive. Still, NPVHSWI is 44 % lower than NPVLSWI. Reduction in production and late production peak influence the cash flow for HSWI significantly, even though investments and production costs are reduced compared to LSWI.  Since the two alternatives are mutually excluding, it is clear from the NPV analysis that LoSal EOR (LSWI) is the preferred project. To better ascertain the economic benefits of LoSal, the differential cash flow is calculated. Figure 4.5 presents the distribution of the additional production from LSWI compared to HSWI.   Figure 4.5 Additional production – Low salinity versus high salinity. Results 25  LSWI recovers 150 barrels more than HSWI. Since LSWI reaches its peak before HSWI, it is assumed that the main contribution comes in the beginning of the lifetime of the field. The peak is followed by a decline until an oil plateau is reached in 2025. From year 2029 the additional production continues to decline.    Furthermore, the differential cash flow (figure 4.6) is calculated using the investment and production costs presented in table 4.1. Oil price of 60 $/bbl and discount rate of 8 % (real terms) are applied.  Figure 4.6 Differential cash flow - Low salinity versus high salinity. Again, the curve of the differential cash flow columns follows the production curve (given in figure 4.5). The effect of early production peak is clear, as the cash flow reaches 570 million dollars eight years after first investment. The net present value of the differential cash flow is: 𝑵𝑷𝑽 𝑳𝑺 𝒗𝒔.  𝑯𝑺 = $𝟐 𝟖𝟔𝟕 𝟗𝟎𝟐 𝟑𝟎𝟏 The economic benefits of LoSal EOR are clear as the differential NPV when choosing LSWI rather than HSWI is $2,8 billion.    Results 26  4.3 Secondary Versus Tertiary EOR The advantage of the Clair Ridge project is that LoSal EOR is adopted as a day one, secondary waterflood. Normally, EOR projects are initiated as a tertiary (reduced salinity injection following higher salinity water injection) waterflood when secondary recovery processes are ineffective, uneconomical or no longer qualified. Hamon (2016) states that tertiary LSWI corefloods do not often succeed in increasing significantly the recovery within the two or three first pore volumes of tertiary injection. However, many authors conclude that tertiary LSWI has positive effects, despite wide variation in results (Hamon, 2016). Figure 4.7 illustrates a typical tertiary coreflood response.  Figure 4.7 Typical coreflood responses – tertiary recovery (Robbana et al., 2012).  Figure 4.7 shows that the secondary oil recovery using high salinity water is 0,74 PV. After approximately 34 PV low salinity water is injected, and it takes an additional 2 PV to reach oil plateau of 0,82 PV, corresponding to a LS EOR effect of 9,75 %. This is further used to estimate a production profile (shown in figure 4.8) for Clair Ridge when LoSal is implemented as a tertiary EOR method.  Results 27   Figure 4.8 Total production forecast for tertiary EOR at Clair Ridge. In a tertiary EOR scenario, HS water is injected from the start and until production starts declining. In 2037 investments are made for LoSal EOR facilities ($120 million over four years), and in 2041 the first effects of LoSal EOR are shown. The tertiary LSWI increase production up to a production plateau of 24 million bbl. The total production is 645 million barrels. Yearly cash flow (figure 4.9) and NPV are calculated using the corresponding costs for LS and HS as presented in table 4.1.  Figure 4.9 Cash flow for tertiary EOR. Results 28  As for the previous cash flows, the returns are negative in the beginning, until production starts. What differs this cash flow from the others, is that an investment is made late in the lifetime of the field. The effect of investment timing is discussed further in chapter 5.3. The NPV for tertiary EOR at Clair Ridge is: 𝑵𝑷𝑽𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝑬𝑶𝑹 =  $𝟑 𝟖𝟕𝟒 𝟕𝟗𝟗 𝟕𝟑𝟕 NPVtertiary EOR shows the value of injection when the production has already started, i.e. when secondary EOR no longer is an option. Once again, the NPV is positive and thus the project is profitable. Nevertheless, NPVtertiary EOR is lower than NPVLSWI. In addition, increased costs and stop in production during deployment of tertiary EOR have not been taken into consideration, due to lack of data. This could also affect the prospective returns and result in an even lower NPV. Further, to evaluate the added value of starting with LoSal EOR from day one (secondary EOR), the differential production and cash flow between secondary EOR and tertiary EOR is calculated. Figure 4.10 presents the additional production.  Figure 4.10 Additional production from secondary EOR compared to tertiary EOR. Secondary EOR recovers 37 million barrels more than tertiary EOR. Since the production during tertiary EOR increases towards the end of the field’s lifetime, the additional production from secondary EOR must come in the beginning of the differential production. The production reaches its peak in 2022 and decreases until a plateau is reached in 2025. After the production plateau, the production decreases significantly and from 2035 there is no additional production. At this point, the production from tertiary EOR is higher than secondary EOR. From the additional production, the differential cash flow is calculated and presented in figure 4.11. Results 29   Figure 4.11 Differential cash flow secondary EOR vs. tertiary EOR. Since the additional production (shown in figure 4.10) ends in 2035, the cash flows from this point on also ends. The NPV calculated from this flow is: 𝑵𝑷𝑽𝒔𝒆𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒅𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝒗𝒔.  𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒂𝒓𝒚 𝑬𝑶𝑹 = $𝟕𝟔𝟒 𝟐𝟒𝟕 𝟓𝟔𝟓 Once more, the NPV is positive with a value of $764 million. This number represents the value gained by starting with LoSal EOR from the beginning of the Clair Ridge project. Discussion 30  5. Discussion 5.1 Profitability of LoSal EOR In chapter 4.1 the differential production and cash flow between Clair Ridge development with LoSal EOR and without LoSal EOR were calculated. The NPV was calculated to be $697 million, which represents the additional profitability BP gains by implementing EOR.  However, there are some uncertainties related to this calculation. LoSal EOR at Clair Ridge is expected to deliver an additional 42 million barrels of oil, which represent a 6 % increase in total production. The investment required for LoSal facilities at Clair Ridge are $120 million, which represent a 2 % increase in total investment costs. These two factors are both future looking statements, and thus subject to uncertainty and risks. To analyze how sensitive the project is to changes in expected production and investments, a two-way table in Excel is made based on the differential cash flow. The result is shown in figure 5.1.  Figure 5.1 NPV versus increase in additional production and increase in investment costs. If the additional production due to LoSal EOR is less than 6 %, the chance of a negative NPV increases. If the investment costs simultaneously increase, the probability of an unprofitable project is even higher. In a worst-case scenario, where LoSal EOR only contributes with 1 % increase in production and investment costs increase by 14 %, the NPV would be -$770 million.  Discussion 31  How
