For this function CSPs arerequired to stay flexible at temperatures determined by the optimum environment ofthe organism. While the thermodynamic properties of these proteins vary depending onthe optimum temperature of the source organism, their structures are highly conserved,making this a good model system to explore non-structural adaptations to various envi-ronments.Single molecule force spectroscopy was used to measure the mechanical properties of theCSP from Bacillus Subtilis while in the functional state, i.e. bound to nucleic acids. Thisbinding was shown to stabilise the protein, without increasing the rigidity, even whenthe temperature of the complex was reduced.The affinity of the CSP binding to ssDNA was measured and this was compared tothe affinity to ssDNA of a CSP from an Arctic soil bacterium, Psychrobacter sp6. TheCSP from the organism adapted to colder environments was found to have a lower bind-ing affinity to ssDNA and the binding strength of ssDNA to both CSPs increased withdecreasing temperature. When the binding of ssDNA was measured at the respectivecold-shock temperatures of each organism the affinities were of the same order of magni-tude, suggesting that the strength of this interaction is tuned to the native environment.To explore how functionality is maintained in organisms adapted to extremely cold en-vironments, the dynamics of the CSP from Psychrobacter sp6 was measured at low,physiologically relevant temperatures using a range of NMR techniques. Results showedevidence of slow exchange with a more disordered state at low temperatures togetherviiiwith fast dynamics at the active site. These were not seen in measurements of theCSP from Bacillus Subtilis at low temperatures, indicating they are part of the proteinadaptation to cold environments.ixContentsPublications ivList of

Currently the most common environments areat low temperature, with 90 % of oceans on earth below 5 °C, and 80 % of the overallbiosphere permanently cold [2]. Organisms have successfully colonised the majority ofthese regions, with measured metabolic activity at -20 °C measured in organisms from theSiberian permafrost [3]. Microbial communities have been found in subglacial outflows [4]and sampled directly from subglacial Antarctic lakes [5], where whole ecosystems exist indark, cold and salty environments. Because of this, psychrophilic (cold-loving) organismsare one of the best models we have to explore potential life on other planets in our solarsystem [6].The work described in this thesis explores the molecular mechanisms involved in theadaptation of organisms to the cold, with a focus on the preservation of flexibility inbiomolecules at low temperatures. The Cold Shock Protein (CSP) and its interactionswith nucleic acids are employed as a model system for this objective, building on previouswork with these proteins [7].This chapter begins with a brief description of some of the important properties ofbiomolecules, how they are affected by temperature and an introduction to the organisms,termed extremophiles, that have adapted to live in environments that were consideredtoo hostile for life before the discovery of thermophiles at Yellowstone in the 1960s [8].This is followed by an overview of the literature surrounding extremophilic proteins and1some of the techniques employed to investigate adaptations of proteins to extremely coldenvironments.1.1 BiomoleculesLiving organisms known on earth are made up of cells, which have been called “TheBuilding Blocks of Life”. Cells in turn are built up from a mixture of biomolecules eachwith its own role in helping the cell survive, grow and reproduce. These include lipids selfassembling to form protective membrane boundaries, cytoskeletons acting as a scaffoldto give cells shape and volume, nucleic acids in the form of DNA and RNA storing thegenetic information and an array of bionanomachines, the proteins.1.1.1 Nucleic AcidsGenetic information is stored and processed by nucleic acids. These flexible moleculescarry information that informs all of life’s processes from one generation to the next.1.1.1.1 DNADeoxyriboNucleic Acid (DNA) is a chain made up of nucleotides with a sugar-phosphatebackbone. The four nucleotides in DNA, Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C) andGuanine (G), make up a four letter code in which all the information required for anorganism to grow and live is written. This includes the code for the amino acid sequenceof every protein in the organism. The section of DNA that encodes a protein is calleda gene. DNA forms a double stranded, helical structure, as each nucleotide bonds toa partner through hydrogen bonding, forming a pair (figure 1.1a). A and T form basepairs containing two hydrogen bonds, while C and G form pairs with three, leading toa higher melting temperature. The double strand stabilises the molecule, protectingthe information from damage which might cause a change in the genetic code, called amutation.2(a) (b)(c) (d)Figure 1.1: Representation of the production of a protein from the genetic code written inthe DNA, or the central dogma of molecular biology. (a) The order of nucleotides A, T, Cand G form the code in the double stranded DNA structure. (b) When this code is beingread for transcription, the double strand is split and one of the strands is used to form RNA.(c) This messenger RNA is used by the ribosome for translation, using the RNA code tosequentially join amino acids into a polypeptide chain, (d) which then folds into the protein3D structure.1.1.1.2 RNARiboNucleic Acid (RNA) carries a 4 letter code just like DNA but the different sugarbase makes it more flexible, and the thymine base is replaced by Uracil (U). It is usuallyfound in the single stranded form and can fold into structures that can perform somecatalyst reactions. This is part of the reason RNA is considered to have possibly formedthe basis of the original self replication in early life [9]. One role of RNA is to carrythe genetic information from the DNA to the ribosome (figure 1.1 b and c), where the3protein polypeptide chain is produced. The versatility of RNA allows it to play manyother roles in the cell, not all of which are fully understood.1.1.2 ProteinsProteins come in a huge variety of shapes [10], as they carry out an equally huge rangeof tasks to maintain life. These 3D structures are formed from polypeptide chains madeup of the 21 naturally occurring amino acids [11], arranged in order according to codewritten in the DNA (figure 1.1 d).All amino acids have the same base of a carboxyl group and an amino group, whichbond to each other in the ribosome to form a chain (figure 1.2). The polypeptide chainthus formed is called the primary structure of the protein. The shape and chemistry of(a) (b)Figure 1.2: Formation of the peptide bond that makes up the backbone of proteins. (a)Two amino acids are brought together in the ribosome and (b) a peptide bond is formedthrough a condensation reaction, releasing a molecule of water.each amino acid side chain determines the characteristics that influence the shape of theprotein. By attracting or repelling each other, or the solvent surroundings, the aminoacid make up of the protein determines the protein shape and behaviour. The 21 mostcommon amino acids are shown in figure 1.3.4Figure 1.3: Amino acid side chain structures, labels and properties. Non-polar (orange)and aromatic (green) side chains are hydrophobic, but polar (blue) are hydrophilic. Sulfurcontaining side chains (yellow) have the ability to form cysteine bonds, which can be used tostabilise protein structures as it is a strong covalent bond. Acidic (red) and basic (purple)residues interact via electrostatics.1.1.3 Protein FoldingThe electric charge, size, shape, polarity or hydrophobicity of the amino acid side chainleads to forces of attraction or repulsion, demonstrated in figure 1.4. Charged residuesare attracted to oppositely charged residues but repulsed by like charge. The shape ofsome side chains reduces the flexibility of the peptide backbone while glycine, containingonly a hydrogen in the side chain position, results in a much more flexible region. Polar5regions will be attracted to each other and to the polar water molecules in the solvent.Hydrophobic residues are pushed toward the centre of the protein structure, away fromthe solvent and this leads to a hydrophobic core. pi stacking is another interactionbetween aromatic rings [12], which are also hydrophobic.The balance of these interactions will push and pull the linear chain into a structure(a) Electrostatics (b) Hydrogen bonds(c) Covalent bond (d) Hydrophobic (e) pi-stackingFigure 1.4: Interactions between protein residues (a) Electrostatic Interactions betweenacidic and basic amino acid side chains (b) Hydrogen bonds between an oxygen and hydrogen(c) Covalent bond between two sulfur atoms (d) Hydrophobic interaction as residues avoidexposure to the solvent (d) pi-stacking interaction between aromatic rings.that minimises the overall free energy of the system. Features called α-helices and β-sheets, make up the secondary structure (figure 1.5) which usually forms spontaneously.α-helices are generally quite flexible, while β-sheets form stable structures made up ofβ-strands arranged either parallel to one another, or anti parallel.These features of the secondary structure are then folded into the tertiary structureof the protein, which is usually represented as a combination of α-helices and β-sheetswith loop regions connecting them. Example 3D protein structures are shown in thisrepresentation in figure 1.6. The titin domain I27 is made up only of β-sheets (figure1.6a) while the Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) structure is mostly α-helical.Quaternary structure describes proteins with structures that include multiple domains.These can be formed from separate polypeptide chains coming together or can fold from6Figure 1.5: Secondary structures formed by folding of the polypeptide chain. An α-helix(red) is one feature that forms and a β-sheet (blue) is the second, which is formed in eitherparallel (left) or anti-parallel (right) orientation. Hydrogen bonds between the oxygen andhydrogen atoms of the peptide backbone are shown (dashed lines)(a) (b)Figure 1.6: Example protein tertiary structures. (a) The 3D structure of I27 (PDB code:1TIT) and (b) the 3D structure of MBP (PDB code: 1N3X) [13,14]a single long chain with different folded regions connected by linker regions.1.1.4 Folding ThermodynamicsThe process of protein folding from an unfolded (U), disordered 2D chain to a folded (F),defined 3D structure can be considered a two state system. This process, if reversible,7results in an equilibrium as shown in equation 1.1.F −−⇀↽− U (1.1)The available free energy of the system is the Gibbs free energy (G). The difference in thisenergy between the folded and unfolded state (∆G = GU - GF ) determines the stabilityof the protein folded state, with a larger negative ∆G describing a folded state that ismore energetically favourable. This available energy is a combination of the enthalpic(∆H) and the entropic (∆S) energy difference as given by equation 1.2.∆G = ∆H − T∆S (1.2)Thermodynamically, entropy is defined by ∆S = qREVT , where qREV is the heat transferbetween the two states and T is the temperature. This change describes the energydispersed during the process of folding or unfolding. The entropic component accountsfor the ordering needed for the protein to fold. In terms of entropy the lowest energy stateis an unfolded polypeptide chain, and without any other forces the protein would notfold. As temperature is increased, the entropic component becomes dominant, as shownin figure 1.7, and the unfolded state becomes more energetically favourable, leading toheat denaturing or melting of the protein.The enthalpy is defined thermodynamically as ∆H = ∆U - ∆(PV) where U is the internalenergy, P is the internal pressure and V is the internal volume of the system. In biologicalsystems this is usually equated with the internal energy as the pressure and volume arenegligible. The interactions between the amino acid side chains provide the enthalpic,chemical component of the free energy.Unlike most ordered molecular systems, proteins usually have a temperature of maximumstability. The plot of free energy shown in figure 1.7 shows an optimal temperature atwhich the free energy difference is largest, where the protein is most stable.8Figure 1.7: Temperature Dependence of the thermodynamic parameters free energy∆G(T), enthalpic energy ∆H(T) and entropic energy -T∆S(T) for the folding of a typi-cal protein. Inset shows an enlarged Gibbs free energy plot. The cold and hot denaturationtemperatures are where the free energy is reduced to zero, and energies of enthalpy andentropy are equal. Taken from Dias 2010 [15]1.1.4.1 Cold DenaturationAs there is a temperature of maximum stability, decreasing the temperature below thispoint causes the protein stability to decrease, leading eventually to cold denaturation [16].For most proteins the temperature at which cold denaturation is predicted to occur isbelow the freezing point of water [15]. Here the protein stability breaks down as all theamino acids are compacted and the balance of forces between them is disrupted. Inparticular, the hydrophobic force (figure 1.4d) is disrupted [15]. This force is a result ofthe high entropic cost of water molecules becoming more ordered at the hydrophobicsurface. This makes the hydrophobic core a consistent feature of proteins, but as tem-peratures decrease, the reordering of water molecules surrounding the protein reducesthis effect. The hydrophobic force is generally strongest around room temperature andis weakened by both increasing and decreasing temperatures, making it an important9feature of protein thermal stability [17]. Experimentally, cold induced unfolding is notalways observed. Some proteins have been measured becoming kinetically trapped inthe state of their native fold while other proteins were measured to be more compactedat low temperatures [18].1.1.4.2 Protein Folding Energy LandscapesThis minimisation of energy is described by the protein energy landscape, shown in figure1.8. In a particular set of conditions, the top of the energy landscape is the free energy ofFigure 1.8: The process of protein folding described by an energy landscape. An unfoldedprotein is in a high energy state as the forces between amino acid side chains are notoptimised. This pushes the polypeptide chain down the energy funnel, towards a lowerenergy state where the forces are balanced. Protein fluctuations can also be described asmovement between states as shown in the expanded picture. The height of the energy barrierbetween the energy minima will determine the rate of exchange (represented here by ns orms time-scales) between the two states.the unfolded protein and the bottom of the funnel is the fully folded protein. The heightof the funnel is the ∆G of folding as represented in figure 1.7, so the funnel is deepestat the temperature that the protein is most stable. The process of a protein structurebeing formed from the polypeptide chain can be described as a protein journey downthe slope of the energy funnel. Each possible conformation of the protein has an energyassociated with it, and the final folded structure is usually where this is at a minimum.This schematic representation provides a convenient description encompassing all of theforces behind protein folding and structure. The structure of each protein has been honed10during the evolution of the organism, and over time each protein will find a structurein an energy minimum that performs the desired function. The landscape will appeardifferent for each protein, and can be affected by the surrounding physical and chemicalenvironment. Some proteins do not have a smooth journey down the energy funnel, andcan get stuck in smaller energy minima in a conformation that is not functional. Proteinchaperones act as catalysts, helping the proteins reach the desired structure by reducingenergy barriers on the slope.1.1.4.3 RNA foldingAs well as proteins, RNA molecules can fold into structures that help RNA in functionand regulation. Because RNA is more flexible than DNA, the formation of base pairsbetween complementary nucleotides can result in a large variety of shapes. These caninclude loops, where the nucleotides are exposed, and hairpin regions (figure 1.9), wherethe nucleotides are paired up, and inaccessible to potential binding partners. In theFigure 1.9: Example of an RNA stem-loop or hairpin structuresame way that proteins can misfold, RNA can form structures that are unfavourable tothe RNA function [19]. This can be caused by external stresses such as solvent conditionsand temperature, or be due to long strands of RNA finding an energy minimum as itexplores the conformational landscape of long polypeptide chains. Misfolded RNA willnot function in the cell and could cause major problems, so RNA chaperones aid foldingby binding RNA and making the misfolded states energetically unfavourable [20].1.1.4.4 RatesBinding and folding processes are governed by the relative energies of the states involved,whether that is folded and unfolded states, or free and bound states. The rate at which11a system will change from a high energy state to a lower energy state depends on theenergy barrier in between them. This corresponds to the energy of the transition state(TS) corresponding to the state the system would have to pass though in order to get tothe lower energy state. This is represented in figure 1.10. The rate at which moleculesFigure 1.10: Energy diagram of the process of changing states. The energy barrier betweenthe high energy starting state, i, and the low energy final state, f is the difference betweenthe energy of the transition state (TS) and the final state, GTS - Gf .change from a high energy state to a low energy state is described by the Arrheniusequation.kR = Ae∆GKRT (1.3)This describes the transition rate, kR, between two states where the activation energyis ∆GK , A is the attempt frequency, R is the gas constant and T is the temperature.1.1.5 Dynamics and FunctionBiomolecules need to be flexible in order to function. DNA needs to be flexible so thatit can be stored compactly in the cell and read by proteins. Too flexible and DNA issusceptible to damage and tangling, but too rigid and it will be useless to the organism.At the scale of proteins and nucleic acids, the nanoscale, thermal fluctuations dominate.Thousands of proteins in each cell have their own very specific task to carry out whichusually involves binding to some other biomolecule. An inflexible, entirely rigid proteinwould need to be thrown by random fluctuations into the perfect position and rotation12with its binding partner before it could carry out this role. Flexibility allows proteins touse thermal energy to sample a range of conformations (right hand inset of figure 1.8)which helps them search for binding sites. When two binding partners come together asubset of the protein conformations are stabilised in the bound state. This adjustment ofprotein conformations can trigger a change in protein activity. Activity that is dependenton ligand binding is a mechanism for protein control in the cell. The protein dynamicsare key to this procesa, as the free protein samples all of the active conformations [21].1.1.6 Protein-Ligand bindingThe role of many proteins involves the binding of some other molecule termed a ligand,which can be DNA, RNA, small molecules or other proteins. This can be part of asignalling process, a regulation process or a chaperoning process where one of the bindingpartners assists the other in reaching the correctly folded state. The process of bindingshares commonalities with the process of folding, involving many of the same forces seenin figure 1.4. Molecules are constantly diffusing around the cell, and when they comeinto contact with one another, if there are attractive forces between them they will bind.High affinity binding partners will have binding rates limited only by this diffusion, thenthe stability of the complex will determine how long they remain bound.1.1.7 Dissociation ConstantThe overall affinity between the two binding partners can be described by the dissociationconstant, KD. It can also be described as the inverse of the association constant KA.KD =1KA=koffkon=[P ][L][PL](1.4)Where kon and koff are the rates of binding and unbinding respectively, [P] and [L]are the concentrations of protein P and ligand L, and [PL] is the concentration of thecomplex. The KD has units of molarity which is useful as it describes the concentrationof ligand, [L], at which 50 % of the protein will be bound. It is also useful as this13number is usually of the same magnitude as the natural concentration of the ligand invivo. Affinity that generates a KD that is stronger than the natural ligand concentrationwill not be selected for during evolution, as it will not lead to any significant increase inthe fraction of bound states. Similarly, if the KD is much smaller than the natural ligandconcentration then the chances of binding become so much smaller that the protein isessentially useless.1.1.8 Environmental StressThe energetics of biomolecules and the interactions between them are finely balancedand have been selected for during evolution in the organism’s native environment. If theenergy difference between two states is too large, then processes will be blocked, too smalland there will be no stability and rates will be affected. These energies can be affected bya number of factors. These include ionic concentration, acidity, pressure, radiation andtemperature which will all affect the folding and binding reactions that keep the organismalive. Changes in any of these conditions will affect all of the processes described here,as well as potentially damaging the genetic information stored in the DNA. Survival influctuating conditions requires a stress response mechanism that allows the system toacclimate to new environments.RNA is more flexible than DNA and hence more susceptible to environmental stress.This property has been exploited by organisms, using RNA as sensor mechanisms thatcan adjust protein production in a responsive manner [22–24].1.2 ExtremophilesLife has been found to exist across earth in a wide range of seemingly extremely un-favourable conditions. From the high temperatures and pressures of deep sea thermalvents, to freezing temperatures deep below the ice sheets, to highly saline waters. Organ-isms that live in environments we would consider as hostile are termed extremophiles.A major component of this adaptation is protein stability [25]. Warm blooded organisms14maintain an internal environment at the temperature and salinity at which their pro-teins function best. Without this protective sheltering, the proteins must adapt at themolecular level to function in whatever environment the organism lives [26].Extremophiles are categorised by the optimum growth conditions of the organisms. Ther-mophiles are defined as organisms with optimum growth temperatures between 45 and 80°C and hyperthermophiles organisms with optimal growth temperatures over 80 °C [25].These organisms would be unable to survive if their proteins unfolded in these high tem-peratures [27]. Other biomolecules such as DNA and RNA are also more vulnerable todamage in these environments and must therefore be protected for species survival [28,29].At the other end of the temperature-scale psychrophiles are adapted to thrive at temper-atures lower than 10 °C [30], where there is reduced source of thermal energy for molecularprocesses.1.2.1 PsychrophilesLiving at low temperatures between 10 °C and -20 °C, psychrophilic organisms areadapted to function with lower levels of thermal energy. This low thermal energy canlead to cold denaturation of proteins [16], as described in section 1.1.4.1. The tempera-ture also leads to a reduction in reaction rates, expecially in enzyme catalysis which isvery temperature dependent. This can be seen in equation 1.5, an expanded version ofequation 1.3 for enzyme catalysis [2,31].kcat = κkBThe−∆GKRT = κkBThe∆SKR e−∆HKRT (1.5)Here κ is the transmission coefficient generally close to 1, kB is the Boltzmann constant(JK−1), h the Planck constant (Js), R the universal gas constant (8.31JK−1mol−1),and -∆GK the free energy of activation or the variation of the Gibbs energy betweenthe activated enzyme-substrate complex and the ground state ES. This temperaturedependence of reaction rates is one of the reasons refrigerators are so useful, as they slowdown bacterial functions. This also makes it one of the major issues that psychrophilesmust counter if they are to thrive at lower temperatures (below 10 °C).151.2.2 Psychrotrophic OrganismsWhile the optimal growth temperature of organisms defined as psychrophiles is below15 °C, psychrotrophs are defined as organisms that can survive in cold environments butwill grow better above 15 °C [6,32]. This is a feature that is true for many cold-adaptedmicroorganisms, as survival in cold environments is helped by the ability to withstand awide range of temperatures. In the rest of this work the term psychrophiles will be usedto cover both psychrophiles and psychrotropic organisms.For example, Psychrobacter sp. B6 is a Gram-negative coccobacillus bacterium foundin Antarctic soils [33]. It grows at temperatures ranging from 0-30 °C with an optimalgrowth temperature of 20 °C, meaning it is defined as a psychrotrophic organism. Anaminotransferase enzyme from this organism has an optimum thermal activity that is20 °C lower than the mesophilic aminotransferase [34]. The crystal structure showed thatthis was not due to an increase in loop length but that an increase in the number ofglycines in key hinge regions allows more flexibility.1.2.2.1 Flexibility in Cold AdaptationMuch work has gone into understanding how cold adapted enzymes counter this exponen-tial decrease in enzymatic rates with lower temperatures [31,35]. Simulations have shownthat low temperature catalytic rates are directly promoted by a higher surface mobilityin the enzyme trypsin [36]. In these simulations, the amino acids of the cold adaptedtrypsin were not changed but the motion of the protein surface was constrained. Chang-ing this around the active site was enough to control the low temperature catalytic rate.Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have also been used to show that an increasein surface mobility, not necessarily near the active site, will increase low temperaturecatalytic activity [37]. In a cold environment, this increase in protein flexibility will beselected for over protein thermal stability, making psychrophilic proteins an interestingroute of investigation when trying to understand the balance between protein functionand stability [38]. To maintain resilience at low temperatures, cold adapted proteins needto counter the increase in viscosity. One tactic for this, would be to shift to a more16Figure 1.11: Predicted Energy landscapes for proteins from thermophiles and psy-chrophiles. Arrows indicate the range of energies that the majority of proteins will haveat the optimum temperatures for each organism, with thermophilic proteins (red) samplinghigh energy states and psychrophilic proteins (blue) sampling the lower energy states.“frustrated” state, meaning the non-covalent interactions are tuned to cause regions ofthe protein to repel other spatially close regions. This can be described as a “rough”energy landscape (figure 1.11), where different protein states are separated by low energybarriers and each energy well is shallow as the repulsive forces counter stabilisation. Asless energy is required for exchange between these states, the protein will sample a rangeof conformations even if there is less thermal energy available.The schematic energy landscapes shown in figure 1.11 represent the theoreticallyfavourable funnels for psychrophiles and thermophiles. The thermophile has a higherenergy barrier between the unfolded and folded state. This accounts for the necessaryincrease in melting temperature of the protein. The psychrophilic protein conformationfunnel has a lower overall energy well, with more native conformational states at the lowenergy levels. At the optimal temperatures for each organism, the proteins are in anenergy conformation at a wide part of the funnel, representing the flexibility of the pro-tein. At the lower temperatures, the thermophilic protein is trapped in a narrow energywell, where it would likely be too rigid to function optimally. At higher t
