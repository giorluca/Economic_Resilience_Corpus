ABSTRACT  
Agriculture in low latitude countries such as Sri Lanka is already operating at the maximum temperature limits 
for crop growth and face increased production risk from expected climate change. Sri Lanka is a developing 
country with limited economic and technological capacity to develop adaptation strategies; hence more 
vulnerable to climate change than developed countries. Coconut (Cocos nucifera L) is a rain fed perennial crop 
important in Sri Lankan culture, food consumption and the economy. It is the second most important food in 
the Sri Lankan diet after rice. Several studies have examined the impact of climate change on Sri Lankan 
agriculture, but none were conducted to simulate the impact of future climate change and future adaptation 
strategies on coconut production, or to calculate the economic welfare effects for different stakeholders in the 
coconut value chain. In this paper we report the development of an economic model of the coconut value 
chain that allows prediction of welfare impacts, and a quantitative representation of coconut yield that allows 
the impact of changing climatic conditions on yield. The average outcome of 16 climate models was used to 
generate future climatic conditions, with two future climatic scenarios for 2020, 2030 and 2050 considered for 
three production regions. The most important yield estimate was a yield decline of more than 10 percent in 
the wet zone with the expected increase of maximum temperature. Without extra adaptation measures this is 
predicted to result in a loss to the industry of 4,795 Rs.Million annually by 2020, which is nearly 4.7 percent of 
the total value of the industry at equilibrium. The negative impact of climate change has the potential to be 
reduced with the implementation of additional adaptation practices. However, the cost effectiveness of these 
practices needs to be considered in comparing the practices. Wider adoption of fertilizer application at specific 
times and moisture conservation practices are estimated to be economically beneficial.

Introduction 
 
Climate change is defined as “any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result 
of human activity” (Houghton et al. 2001:62). Data analyses have confirmed that climate change is consistent 
with the observations of global warming and other changes in the climate system (Houghton et al., 2001). The 
agriculture sector is one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change (Burton et al., 2005; Fischer et al., 
2005; Fisher et al., 2012). According to the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the negative impacts 
on crop production will be more common than positive impacts (IPCC, 2014a). Agriculture in low latitude 
countries is already operating at the maximum temperature limits for crop growth and at a greater production 
risk than the high latitude countries (IPCC, 2014a). Thus, crop productivity is expected to improve in mid and 
high latitude countries whereas in low latitude countries it is expected to decrease, with an expected local

temperature increase of 1-2
0
C. Further, an increase in frequency of droughts and floods is expected in these 
low latitude regions (IPCC, 2014a). The majority of the countries located in low latitudes are developing 
countries which have limited economic and technological capacity to develop adaptation strategies; hence 
they are more vulnerable to climate change than developed countries (Mertz et al., 2009). 
 
Sri Lanka is a South Asian tropical island and there is already evidence that its climate has changed. An annual 
temperature increase of 0.016
0
C was observed during the period 1960 to 1990 across the country as a whole. 
The day time maximum and night time minimum mean air temperatures have increased by 0.021
0
C and 0.02
0
C 
per year, respectively (Basnayake, 2011). Meanwhile, the number of consecutive dry days has increased in the 
dry and the intermediate climatic zones. The number of warm days and warm nights has increased while the 
number of cold days and nights has decreased (Ministry of Environment, 2010a). The average annual rainfall 
decreased by 144mm, around seven percent, during the same period and the distribution pattern has also 
changed (Basnayake, 2011). The North East monsoon rainfall has decreased with an increase in rainfall 
variability. The occurrence of single-day heavy rainfall events has shown an increasing trend. 
 
However, studies on future climate projections for Sri Lanka are limited and the available projections show 
conflicting outcomes especially for rainfall (Eriyagama et al., 2010a). According to Basnayake (2011), monsoon 
rainfall is predicted to increase by 2025 under the A2 emission scenario. A2 is the medium emission scenario 
with the HadCM3 model which is based on hypothetical emission scenarios suggested by IPCC. Mean 
temperatures are expected to increase by 2.9
0
C and 2.5
0
C during the northeast and southwest monsoon 
periods, respectively, by the end of this century. The occurrence of weather extremes, especially droughts and 
floods, are expected to be frequent. Wet areas will get more rain and dry areas will become drier by 2025 
(Basnayake, 2011).  
 
Several recent studies have analysed the potential impact of climate change on the agriculture sector of Sri 
Lanka. These studies have mainly focussed on paddy rice cultivation which is the staple food of Sri Lanka (De 
Silva et al., 2007; Kurukulasuriya et al., 2007). They found that the impact on wet season paddy would be 
negative for many parts of the country except in the extreme south (De Silva et al., 2007). Another study found 
regional variation in the profitability of smallholder farmers where the farmers in the wet high latitude areas 
benefited while the farmers in the north western and south eastern lowlands were adversely affected 
(Kurukulasuriya et al., 2007).  
 
Perennial cropping systems are thought to be more vulnerable to climate change because they are long 
established (Lobell et al., 2006); however, there are few studies conducted for plantation agriculture. A study 
of the tea industry found that the impact on mid and lowland grown tea was more negative than that on 
highland grown tea (Wijeratne et al., 2007). This classification was based on the topography of the lands from 
sea level. 
 
Coconut (Cocos nucifera L) is a rain fed perennial crop important in Sri Lankan culture, food consumption and 
the economy. It is the second most important food in the Sri Lankan diet after rice. An analysis of the 
economic impact of climate variability on the coconut industry conducted using 1971-2001 data showed that 
60 percent of the variation in coconut production can be explained by climatic factors. It was estimated that 
the industry could incur an economic loss of US$32 million to US$73 million in extreme shortages while gaining 
an income of US$42 million to US$87 million in crop gluts (Fernando et al., 2007). This study emphasized the 
potential benefits that can be gained through adaptation strategies. Coconut production forecasting studies 
have shown that annual coconut production is particularly sensitive to rainfall during January to March in the 
main coconut growing regions (Peiris et al., 2008). Further, maximum ambient temperature and relative 
humidity in the afternoon are the most significant variables in nut production (Peiris et al., 1997). Another 
study showed that coconut production will be lower by 2040 under six climate change scenarios (Peiris et al., 
2004). 
 
However, none of the studies cited were conducted to simulate the impact of future climate change and 
future adaptation strategies on coconut production, or to calculate the economic welfare effects for different 
stakeholders in the coconut value chain (Winters et al., 1998).  That was the objective of this study. Achieving 
that objective requires an economic model of the value chain that allows prediction of welfare impacts, and a 
quantitative representation of coconut yield that allows the impact of changing climatic conditions on yield.

Economic structure of the coconut industry in Sri Lanka 
The first step is to understand the economic structure of coconut production and marketing in Sri Lanka. 
Following the land reforms of the early 1970s, the production structure of the industry has shifted dramatically 
from plantation to small scale. Today, of the 2,175,000 holdings growing coconut, the smallholding sector 
makes up around 82 per cent of the total. This was around 64 percent in the early 1970s.

The main coconut growing area consists of three administrative districts called the “Coconut Triangle”: 
Kurunegala, Puttalam and Gampaha (as shown in Figure 1). This region contains 57 percent of the total 
coconut lands. The Southern Province is identified as the “Mini-Coconut Triangle” and comprises the Galle,

Matara and Hambantota administrative districts. It contains around 12 percent of the coconut cultivated lands. 
The remaining coconut land is distributed throughout the country except for the central upcountry where 
coconut is not grown due to low temperatures.  
 
The coconut processing sector comprises two distinct sub-sectors: kernel and non-kernel products. The major 
kernel products are coconut oil, desiccated coconut, copra, coconut cream, and coconut milk powder. 
Historically (up until the mid-1970s), coconut oil was the major export commodity and it utilized some 28 
percent or 683 million nuts of annual output processed for export, followed by desiccated coconut (15 percent 
or 380 million nuts) and copra (180 million nuts annually).  
 
The value chain map of the coconut kernel products sector is shown in Figure 2. Fresh coconut production 
requires input supplies such as seedlings, fertilizer and agrochemicals, extension services, management and 
labour (Pathiraja et al., 2013b). The output is received by the processors with the involvement of different 
chain actors. Direct sales to the processors are not very common. Estate level plantations and contract based 
cooperative societies are examples of chain actors that deal directly with processors. Generally the longest 
chain is through village level primary collectors, secondary collectors, wholesalers and brokers to the 
processors (Samarajeewa et al., 2004). Fresh coconuts are sold through a broker to the exporters in the fresh 
nut export market. However, the fresh nut export market is comparatively small and only comprises one to 
two percent of the total coconut production. Fresh nuts are sold to the retailers through any of these 
collectors and local fresh nut consumers are the ultimate market.  
 
The desiccated coconut industry is the main coconut processing industry and 99 percent of its production is 
exported through brokers. Copra is an intermediary product sold directly to the coconut oil processors or 
through village level collectors to the copra dealers.  Coconut oil reaches the local consumers through a 
wholesaler and retailer. Around 4 percent of coconut oil production is exported and brokers are involved in 
sales. Other kernel products are coconut milk powder, coconut milk and cream, sold in both local and export 
markets. The local consumer market is approached through a distributor or wholesaler, whereas the export 
market is through direct sales to the buyers.  
 
The non-kernel sector products are based on the husk and the shell of the coconut. Husk products include 
bristle fibre, mattress fibre, coir pith and other value added products, for example coir yarn, coir twine, 
Tawashi brushes, coir brooms, brushes, rubberized coir pads, mattress for bedding, coir mats, rugs, fibre pith, 
husk chips, geo textiles and moulded coir products used in horticulture. The greater part of these value added 
products are exported.  
 
These value chains are described in detail in Pathiraja et al. (2015). 
Economic model of the coconut market in Sri Lanka  
The next step is to translate this information on the value chains into an economic model that can be used for 
simulation purposes. Previous literature on the coconut industry was also examined but none of the previous 
studies focused on both vertical and horizontal disaggregation and all are quite dated. De Silva (1985) 
hypothesised the impacts of different domestic and export policies but these were illustrated graphically due 
to a lack of coefficients in estimating the actual impact. A coconut market model was estimated (Samarajeewa, 
2002a; Samarajeewa et al., 2002). This model considered three major products culinary coconut, coconut oil 
and desiccated coconut. The supply and demand functions were linked using the equilibrium price and those 
functions were econometrically estimated. Producer surplus for growers was analysed in terms of trade 
liberalisation, cultivation subsidies and export levy on desiccated coconut. However, the economic surpluses 
were not estimated for all the horizontal markets and vertical disaggregation was not considered.  
 
A carefully designed market structure to represent an industry is vital in accurately estimating the impacts of 
exogenous shocks to the market and its segments (Mounter et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2000b). Further, 
disaggregation of the industry in both vertical and horizontal directions allows a sound analysis of the impacts 
across different sectors and, where relevant, regions (Mounter et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2000b).

The economic structure of the coconut industry in Sri Lanka in equilibrium displacement model (EDM) form is 
shown in Figure 3. This is based on the detailed mapping of the various sector value chains reported in 
(Pathiraja et al., 2015). Following previous EDM studies (Mounter et al., 2007; Mounter et al., 2008; Zhao, 
1999; Zhao et al., 2003), each rectangle represents a production function. The arrows represent demand and 
supply relationships where an arrow head represents a product demand while the arrow shaft indicates the 
supply of a product. The ovals represent factor supplies and product demands where an exogenous shift would 
occur.  
 
The industry is vertically disaggregated into coconut production, processing, marketing and consumption. 
Horizontally it is segmented into four major product groups. Thus there are eight industry sectors in the

model: fresh nut retailing, desiccated coconut processing, export marketing of desiccated coconut, copra 
processing, coconut oil processing, export marketing of coconut oil, domestic marketing of coconut oil, and 
“other products” processing. This is similar to the Henderson et al. (2006) model of an Indonesian coconut 
industry. 
 
Total production indicates the annual national production of the country in the equilibrium year. In this 
structure it is not represented as a production function considering the complexity of modelling production of 
a perennial crop. Generally, farmers provide their harvest directly or through collectors to the wholesaler 
which involves a marketing cost, however there is little data on these transactions. The distribution link from 
farmers to wholesalers is contracted to wholesalers in this model, and it is assumed that wholesalers then 
distribute the raw coconuts to different production sectors.  
 
Nearly 65 percent of the produce is retailed and freshly consumed (this figure includes the farm consumption 
of fresh nuts due to the unavailability of disaggregated data). The remaining 35 percent is used in the 
processing industries.  
 
The desiccated coconut industry uses nearly 11 percent of the raw nuts and nearly 99 percent of this output is 
exported. Copra is an intermediary product used in coconut oil production which utilises about 20 percent of 
raw coconuts.  
 
Nearly 97 percent of copra production is used for coconut oil production while the rest is exported. 
Approximately 96 percent of coconut oil is domestically consumed while the rest is exported. 
 
Other products include a variety of export products (instant coconut milk powder, coconut milk, coconut 
cream, seed nuts). All of these products are aggregated into one category named ‘other products’ that 
altogether utilises approximately five percent of the raw coconuts.  
 
It is assumed that all the coconuts are sold at the farm gate level to the wholesalers. Empirically this group 
consists of farmers and collectors at different levels below the wholesalers. There is an average price mark up 
of nearly 32 percent between farm gate and wholesale price which can be an approximation for the benefit 
share of this segment. Wholesalers distribute coconuts to the processors and retailers. This involves 
transportation, handling, initial processing (removing husk), storage and marketing costs. Therefore, in this 
model, the wholesale price is considered as the farm gate price (supply price) and it is common for all the 
horizontal markets. For this reason, total fresh nut production is assumed to be at the wholesale level. 
Coconut retailers purchase from wholesalers and it involves transportation, storage and marketing inputs in 
reaching the ultimate consumers. It is assumed that wholesalers sell the husked nuts to the processors.  
 
Desiccated coconut is processed and packed at the factory and sold by auction to the exporters. The major 
part of this output is exported. Copra is processed and sold through dealers to a coconut oil miller. The millers 
process and sell coconut oil to wholesalers or retailers and exporters. 
 
The above structure can be described in terms of demand and supply equations. The industry is assumed to be 
in equilibrium and together with assumptions of normal profit and constant returns to scale technologies this 
ensures that all the markets clear. The relationship among the industries is represented by general functional 
forms. Exogenous shift variables are incorporated in product demand and factor supply equations. These 
exogenous and endogenous variables are defined in Table 1.   
 
The details of the theoretical development of the equations in the model, and the transformation of these 
equations into the displacement form used in the simulations, are provided in Pathiraja et al. (2017a). Also 
described are the choices for equilibrium prices and quantities (Coconut Development Authority, 1970-2013), 
and parameter values. Finally, that study describes some hypothetical simulations of external shocks which 
provide some validation of the plausibility of the results that are generated.

Modelling of coconut yield determinants - Analytic Hierarchy Process  
Estimating the welfare impacts of climate change on coconut production, and the potential benefits of 
investing in adaptation options, requires a process whereby future climate scenarios can be explicitly related 
to coconut yield.  
 
Previous yield estimation and prediction studies for coconut in Sri Lanka which attempted to develop statistical 
relationships between annual yield and climatic factors were not conclusive due to the complex nature of 
coconut yield (Abeywardena, 1966, 1968; Brintha et al., 2012; Peiris et al., 2008; Peiris et al., 2000; Peiris et al., 
1997; Peiris et al., 1995; Peiris, 1998; Peiris, 1991-1993). Process based models such as InfoCrop are 
considered more illustrative and there is one developed for India (Kumar et al., 2008). However, applicability 
of these models to the Sri Lankan context is limited due to data availability.   
 
In this study, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1987) was used. AHP is an Expert Systems Modelling 
approach and provides a means of modelling in a situation where data from conventional sources may be 
partially lacking  (Sposito et al., 2013). For example, first the problem or the goal is decomposed into its 
determinants or decision variables (Bantayan et al., 1998). For a yield estimation study, mean annual yield is 
the objective and determinant variables are found to be climate, soil and topography. In deciding the 
contribution of these factors to mean annual yield, previous literature can be used.  In the absence of a 
reliable source, expert opinion can be incorporated and the contribution is measured in terms of a weight. 
Those are obtained through a pairwise comparison of determinant variables by the experts. The hierarchy 
structure of the AHP differs from the traditional decision tree approach since each level shows a different 
aspect of the problem which runs down from an overall objective to criteria, sub criteria and alternatives 
(Saaty, 1990).

AHP has been used in climate change and climate change adaptation studies as a decision support tool 
(Bharwani, 2013; Jayathilaka et al., 2012; Jorge et al., 2015; Kazemi et al., 2016; Li et al., 2014; Sposito et al., 
2013). A main advantage of this method over other biophysical methods is that it can take into account both 
factors that can be quantified and that cannot be quantified (Bharwani, 2013; Saaty, 1988).  For this reason, it 
has the advantage of incorporating expert opinion over empirical methods which are entirely based on 
correlations among factors (Sposito et al., 2013).  
 
The way that AHP was implemented in this study is described in Pathiraja et al. (2017b). For example, Table 2 
shows how expert opinion is used to develop higher level weightings for the influence of various biophysical 
factors.

Figure 4 shows the overall structure of the land suitability model and climate and topography hierarchy. The 
weights show that the most influential factor is climate followed by soil and topography. The assigned values 
are 0.487, 0.435 and 0.078. Sub criteria for climatic factors were selected based on the literature and weighed 
with expert views. Maximum temperature and rainfall were weighed equally important with a weight of 0.455 
and solar radiation (sunshine hours) was given 0.091. 
 
The AHP model was then calibrated to sites within each of the major coconut production zones (Figure 1), 
using a range of climate models
1
. Predictability of each of the 16 climate models was compared with the base 
year 2010 to find the best suitable model. However, with the disparities of the predicted climatic conditions, 
the average outcome of the 16 models was used to generate the future climatic conditions and 99 replicates 
for each site were obtained for smoothing the data. Two future climatic scenarios for 2020, 2030 and 2050 
were considered.  
 
The estimated yield estimates under the two designated climate scenarios for the three production zones are 
shown in Table 3. Based on these results, a yield decline is expected in the wet zone with the expected 
increase of maximum temperature; yield is expected to increase in the intermediate dry zone with the 
expected precipitation increase (rainfall is a limiting factor in the intermediate dry zone compared to the wet 
zone); and yield in the intermediate wet zone is not expected to be influenced by the expected climate.

Adaptation options and yield change 
 
Given the dominant influence of the wet zone shown in Table 3, the adaptation practices required in the 
expected future climate should be focussed on mitigating the impact of increased maximum temperature.  
 
Some of the adaptation strategies identified as being effective for coconut are summer or drought irrigation, 
application of high doses of fertilizer to capture the positive effect of climate change (increase in rainfall and 
CO2), soil moisture conservation (mulching, cover crops, coconut husk or dust pits and rainwater harvesting), 
growing short term pulses and growing drought tolerant varieties (Hebbar et al., 2013; Naresh Kumar et al., 
2013). Shifting of cultivation to more suitable areas can be considered as another strategy to overcome the 
total yield loss. In a previous study, increase in rainfall in the intermediate zone has suggested an increase in 
moderately suitable areas for coconut towards north and south-west part of the zone (Jayathilaka et al., 2012). 
This shows productivity improvements in the existing coconut lands due to favourable rainfall. 
 
The predicted climatic conditions for these three sites show that an increase in the maximum temperature 
would be the main yield limiting factor despite an increasing rainfall trend. This temperature increase is 
already clear in historical data for the wet zone, where favourable temperature conditions for coconut are 
starting to change and become less favourable. Generally, rainfall increase is offsetting the temperature effect 
to some extent (IPCC, 2014c).  Moisture conservation practices are recommended for regions where rainfall is 
low and dry periods are prominent (intermediate and dry zone). However, since the temperature peak during 
the February/March period is prominent with slight rainfall increase, the transpiration rate will be high. 
Adapting these practices (moisture conservation, suitable intercropping to change the micro climate and 
diversify the income, weed management, fertilizer application and organic matter improvement) will help to 
improve plant vigour and to sustain the current productivity level or to gain the optimum benefit of climate 
change under future climatic conditions.  These can be considered as good agricultural practices that will 
improve the productivity and income of the farmers. A high level of adoption of these practices can be 
considered as a way of adapting to productivity changes due to climate change. The other option for adapting 
to climate change is through the adoption of new technologies. More efficient irrigation systems and heat 
tolerant cultivars would come under this category. 
 
A heat tolerant cultivar or a variety that can withstand the temperature increase to perform well under 
increased temperature conditions would be the long term solution, although it may take many years to 
develop for coconut. Cultivars with drought tolerant traits are important for moisture stress which is observed 
in each climatic zone.  
 
Ten potential adaptation option scenarios were considered, in addition to current practice. These scenarios are 
shown in Table 4. 
 
If we assume the need for a high level of adaptation measures (from among the above practices), each 
adaptation practice will somewhat reduce the total yield loss. These options, under different adaptation levels 
and relative yield changes in terms of total industry, are represented in Table 5.  
 
Likely economic impact of climate change on the coconut industry 
 
The yield changes due to each adaptation practice described under scenarios 2 to 11 were estimated with 
respect to the yield under climate change without adaptation (or scenario 1). Therefore, these yield estimates 
are net yield changes that offset the yield loss due to climate change and add some extra yield. However yield 
changes per se are not the inputs required by the economic model (the K shift). A shift in supply is equivalent 
to a productivity change which affects the cost of production of coconut. Therefore, the supply price of 
coconut changes depending on the size and direction of the supply shift, and depends on the relative 
magnitudes of the supply and demand elasticities. Figure 5 shows the expected direction of the supply shifts 
under each scenario. The equilibrium supply is denoted by S0 and the other notations are related to some of 
the scenarios specified in Table 5.

Scenario 1 describes the yield change predicted under climate change conditions in 2020 compared to the 
base equilibrium condition. Scenario 1 is the current adaptation level or yield change with no adaptation 
and it is the base for rest of the scenarios. 
 
Scenario 2 describes increased fertilizer application in the wet zone. It is expected that there will be a 22 
percent yield increase for irregular fertilizer users in the wet zone when they shift from irregular to regular 
fertilizer application. Nearly 35 percent of the lands currently have irregular fertilizer applied.  
 
Scenario 3 and scenario 4 show increases in fertilizer application from irregular to regular in the 
intermediate zone (intermediate wet and intermediate dry zones) and both wet and intermediate zones. A 
22 percent yield increase is expected for irregular fertilizer users. It is estimated there are 26 percent and 
18 percent irregular fertilizer users from intermediate wet and intermediate dry zones.  
 
Scenarios 5, 6 and 7 show the possible yield changes with irrigation during drought periods. Yield changes 
in the wet zone, intermediate zone and in both intermediate and wet zones are represented by the 
scenarios 5, 6 and 7 respectively. Only 50 percent of the lands are assumed to be irrigated and a yield 
increase of 30 percent is assumed with irrigation for those lands based on previous studies. 
 
Scenarios 8, 9 and 10 show the yield increase due to husk pits as a moisture conservation practice in the 
wet zone, intermediate zone and in both zones. Nearly 41 percent of the farmers practice husk pits and we 
assumed here a further 25 percent of the farmers will practice this moisture conservation practice. It has 
the potential to increase yield by 20 percent from those lands. 
 
Scenario 11 shows the impact of a heat tolerant cultivar that can sustain the existing productivity in the 
wet zone under future climate change conditions especially the increase in temperature.

Given these 11 K shifts, the quantity and price changes under climate change with respect to the base 
equilibrium, and then under the five sets of adaptation practices (scenarios 2 to 11), were estimated with the 
previously described EDM. The impact of these price changes on the coconut industry and its stakeholders 
were quantified in economic surplus terms. These economic surplus changes were estimated for each scenario 
with respect to the base equilibrium condition. The results are shown in Table 7. 
 
One issue to note here is that the underlying assumption of local linearity, and therefore the strict validity of 
the EDM results, holds when the changes around the equilibrium are “small”. Small is not defined but less than 
ten percent would be a reasonable assumption. Therefore when the K shift is greater than ten percent, the 
economic surplus changes are very uncertain and the functional form of the demand and supply curves matter 
(Zhao et al., 1997). Therefore, the precision of EDM outcome for the scenarios 4 to 7 and 10 are highly 
uncertain.

Scenario 1 describes the climate change without extra adaptation measures (under current adaptation). The 
total change in benefits due to climate change is 4,795 Rs.Million
2
 which is nearly 4.7 percent of the total value 
of the industry at equilibrium (Table 7a, scenario 1). This is a loss to the industry since the yield is reduced by 
1.3 percent under climate change.  
 
The distribution of benefits or losses from climate change is useful in identifying the most affected 
stakeholders in the industry due to climate change. Broadly defined, nearly 68 percent of the loss is shared by 
input suppliers into the coconut industry while the remaining 32 percent is shared by coconut product 
consumers.  
 
Nearly 66 percent of the losses are shared by coconut “wholesalers”. Recall that this group involves coconut 
growers, intermediary collectors and wholesalers. Domestic coconut consumers share around 22 percent of 
the economic surplus while six percent is shared by domestic coconut oil consumers and some three percent 
by export desiccated coconut consumers. Other export product processors and consumers share nearly one 
percent each.  
 
With Additional Adaptation 
 
Scenario 2 to Scenario 11 describe possible adaptation practices at different levels under which yield changes 
due to climate change are expected to be minimised or improved through good agricultural practices and 
specific climate change adaptation practices (Table 7).  
 
The largest total impact to the industry is shown under scenarios 5, 6 and 7 which show irrigation during 
drought periods. Scenario 5 shows a benefit gain (Rs.Million 12,023) to the industry which is equivalent to 12 
percent of the total value of the industry at equilibrium. Irrigation during dry periods by 50 percent of the 
farmers in the wet zone is assumed in scenario 5. Scenarios 6 and 7 show gains of 23 and 40 percent to the 
total value of the industry with irrigation in intermediate zone and in both wet and intermediate zones 
respectively. 
 
The next rewarding adaptation practice is scenario 11 which assumes a heat tolerant cultivar that would 
sustain the existing productivity level under wet zone climatic conditions. This benefit change is equivalent to 
Rs. Million 6,712 which is nearly seven percent of the total value of the industry at equilibrium.  
 
The third rewarding crop management practice is fertilizer application in the wet zone (scenario 2). A benefit 
gain of Rs.Million 3,721 is observed to the industry which is nearly four percent of the value of the industry at 
equilibrium. Scenario 3 shows nearly the same amount of gain which shows fertilizer application 
improvements in intermediate zone. This is a net gain to the industry which offset the yield reduction in wet 
zone. If fertilizer application can be improved in both wet and intermediate zones, the benefit gain is nearly 
Rs.Million 12,628 which is around 12 percent of the value of the industry at equilibrium (Scenario 4). This is 
important for intermediate zone since the expected rainfall gain will improve the land suitability for coconut. 
 
Scenarios 8, 9 and 10 show the benefit change due moisture conservation practices considering coconut husk 
pits. It shows a net gain to the industry at equilibrium with the percentages of one, four and ten respectively.  
 
A summary of the economic surplus change under each scenario is presented in Table 8. 
 
The distribution of benefits from climate change adaptation practices is useful in identifying who is getting the 
most out of the investments in adaptation practices. This distribution pattern of economic surplus change is 
exactly the same as the distribution of the losses from no additional adaptation - nearly 66 percent of the 
benefits go to coconut “wholesalers” (coconut growers, intermediary collectors and wholesalers); domestic 
coconut consumers share around 22 percent of the economic surplus; six percent is shared by domestic 
coconut oil consumers; some three percent by export desiccated coconut consumers; and other export 
product processors and consumers share nearly one percent each.

 At the current exchange rate of $US1=LKR150, this loss is around $US32 million. Alternatively the loss is 
around Euro30 million.

Cost effectiveness 
 
Thus, the negative impact of climate change has the potential to be reduced with the implementation of 
additional adaptation practices. However, the cost effectiveness of these practices needs to be considered in 
comparing the practices. Generally, there are previous studies that analysed the yield gains and cost 
effectiveness of those practices which are site specific especially to the intermediate and dry zones 
(Abeygunawardena et al., 1995; Appuhamy, 2005; Dias, 1993; Liyanage, 1987; Liyanage, 1988). Investment 
potential in financial and practical terms (availability of a water source for irrigation during drought periods, 
time taken to develop a drought tolerant variety, labour availability, site specific factors that affect 
responsiveness to agronomic practices and availability of coconut husk) can be limited. Table 9 shows the 
estimated costs of investment for each scenario based on previous studies and converted to current price. 
Accordingly, fertilizer application and moisture conservation are estimated to be economically beneficial.  
 
Irrigation is economical with the option ‘a’ which is developed as a low cost drip irrigation method for small 
scale application (Liyanage et al., 2008).  Option ‘b’ is large scale drip irrigation systems and is found to be not 
economical.  This shows the potential for agronomic practices to offset the expected yield declines in the wet 
zone.  
 
Sensitivity analysis: probability distributions of economic surplus changes  
 
The results of the base case EDM depend on the selected parameters for the model that were chosen based 
on previous empirical estimates, economic theory and subjective judgements. Empirical estimates were 
available from only a few studies and some parameter values were not available. Assumptions were made 
especially for input substitution and product transformation elasticities based on the assumptions of previous 
literature. To overcome these uncertainties in the estimates, these parameters were assigned probability 
distributions. Then a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to generate the probability distribution of the 
results. The results of these exercises are not reported here for space reasons.

Discussion and conclusions 
 
The analysis reported here shows that estimated future climate change scenarios have a large potential 
negative economic impact on the Sri Lankan coconut value chain. The mean value of this loss is Rs.Million 
4,781 per year which is nearly five percent of the total value of the industry at equilibrium. This loss is mainly 
shared by coconut wholesalers (growers, collectors and wholesalers) which account for two-thirds of the total 
impact, followed by domestic coconut and coconut oil consumers. The impact on other input suppliers is 
comparatively low - nearly 33 Rs.Million for other product exporters; 31 Rs.Million for the desiccated coconut 
industry (including export marketing and processing); and 11 Rs.Million for the coconut oil industry including 
processing and marketing.  
 
Thus coconut farmers and domestic consumers should be the main beneficiaries from any assistance schemes.  
 
The possible agronomic adaptation practices which are currently being used or which are under consideration 
were tested for the feasibility of economic gains. All the agronomic practices considered show the potential for 
further improvements in yield which can offset the negative impact due to climate change in the wet zone. All 
the economic surplus changes show positive gains.  
 
The most rewarding management practice was irrigation (scenarios 5, 6 and 7). It has a potential to improve 
the yield in each climatic zone. However, these K shifts are greater than 10 percent which shows that the 
results can be highly variable. The expected economic benefit change is 12,034 Rs.Million when adapted in the 
wet zone only and 41,198 Rs.Million when adapted in both the wet and intermediate zones. This was assuming 
that 50 percent of the lands would practice irrigation in both zones considering the practical limitations (soil 
type, shallow depth ground water table). However, the cost estimates show that this is not economically 
feasible given the cost of drip irrigation systems estimated in a previous study (Mahindapala et al., 1991) and 
converted to current prices.  This cost is nearly 23,617 Rs.Million for the wet zone and 62,979 Rs.Million for 
both wet and intermediate zones which are far beyond the expected gain in benefits. A low cost irrigation 
system developed for small scale lands show that it is economically feasible (Liyanage et al., 2008). However, 
Griffith  et al. / Proceedings in System Dynamics and Innovation in Food Networks 2017, 460-485

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.18461/pfsd.2017.1746 
this estimate has omitted operational cost and some machinery cost. It shows the cost is around 5,722 and 
15,259 Rs.Million for wet zone and in adapting in both zones. However, the economic benefits can be reduced 
with the inclusion of other costs and still it shows the benefits from low cost irrigation systems. A study has 
found that irrigation is mainly limited due to high cost of establishing irrigation systems followed by lack of a 
water source (Somasiri et al., 1993). Therefore, this has become a rarely practiced adaptation except for 
seedling irrigation which is mainly hand irrigated. To address the issue of unavailability of a water source for 
irrigation during drought periods, a farmer support scheme was introduced to establish deep ground water 
wells (50 percent of the cost) in drought prone areas (Dias, 1993). However, the effectiveness of this scheme in 
addressing the issue has not been reported.  
 
The next agronomic practice is fertilizer application. It shows a benefit gain of 3,723 Rs.Million with fertilizer 
application in wet zone alone. Under current management practices, nearly 26 percent of the growers are 
regular fertilizer users while nearly 34 percent are irregular users. It is assumed that those 34 percent of the 
growers can be converted to regular fertilizer users which may result in a yield increase of 27 percent from 
those lands (from eight percent to 35 percent compared to an unfertilized land). Cost is estimated to be 1,040 
Rs.Million for the wet zone. This shows that fertilizer application is an economically feasible practice. However, 
the response to fertilizer depends on several factors including soil type, variety and split application which may 
incur additional labour charges. Empirically the response rate is low compared to the experimental results (13 
nuts /palm is observed while 25 nuts/palm is expected). As a result, site specific fertilizer recommendations 
are provided for the farmers.  
 
Rainfall increase in the intermediate zone is expected to result in a productivity improvement (1.8 percent 
annual yield). A previous study has shown a shift in productivity of coconut lands in these areas (spatial shift in 
productivity) with favourable climate (Jayathilaka et al., 2012). Fertilizer application will be an option for 
capturing the positive effect of climate change and to offset the negative impact to the industry. Therefore, 
the grower subsidies can be directed for the farmers in these areas with further favourable future climate 
improvements. However, the wet zone has better climatic conditions compared to other regions despite its 
temperature increase.  
 
The third rewarding adaptation option is a heat tolerant cultivar that would sustain the current productivity 
level under temperature increase in wet zone. This is expected to result in 6,715 Rs.Million gain for the 
industry offsetting the 4781 Rs.Million loss. The cost involved in developing a heat tolerant cultivar or a variety 
is not available. It will be important to have a variety with traits of heat and drought tolerance under future 
climatic conditions.  
 
Moisture conservation with husk or coir dust pits is already practiced by 41 percent of the growers. Adoption 
of this practice by  a further 25 percent of growers is assumed since the rest of the growers had concerns on 
cost (50 percent) and availability of husks. It is not essential for some areas with shallow water table. It is 
specially recommended for gravelly soils in the wet and intermediate zones. The benefit change due to 
moisture conservation in wet zone is nearly 745 Rs.Million and the cost is estimated to be 809 Rs.Million. 
However, this gain is after offsetting the loss of 4795 Rs.Million which was due to climate change. Therefore, 
moisture conservation can be considered as a potential adaptation measure.  
 
These impacts mainly depend on the K shift which represents the magnitude of the yield shock in terms of 
price change followed by supply elasticity of coconut, domestic coconut oil demand elasticity and desiccated 
coconut export demand elasticity. It shows that demand from these industries change the price of coconut. 
More accurate estimation of these parameters will improve the accuracy of the results. Further, the model has 
limitations in selecting the parameters for input substitution and output transformation which was assumed 
based on previous literature. The economic surplus estimated for scenarios 4 to 7 and 10 are highly uncertain 
since the K shift for these scenarios are not small. 
 
The uncertainty of the model parameters was addressed with a stochastic sensitivity analysis. It shows the 
probability distribution of benefits incurred in each scenario. Further work is required on the specification of 
the appropriate distributions for the various parameter values.
