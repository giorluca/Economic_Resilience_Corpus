Human populations and livelihoods in these coastal provinces are at greaterrisk than those in inland provinces. However, little is known about the communities’ resilienceand coping capacities regarding hydrometeorological hazards of varying magnitudes. The studyconducted a quantitative socio-economic assessment of how people in Krabi and Nakhon Si Tham-marat provinces manage and respond to hydrometeorological hazards, examining their resilienceand coping capacities. This was a cross-sectional study based on secondary data collection on thesocial and economic dimensions of resilience, and a review of literature on coping mechanismsto hydrometeorological hazards within the study area. Measuring and mapping socio-economicresilience was based on the available data gathered from the social and economic dimensions, withexisting or standard indicators on exposure and vulnerability applied uniformly across subdistricts.A combination of social and economic dimensions produced novel socio-economic resilience indexscores by subdistrict, which were mapped accordingly for the two coastal provinces. The studyalso derived a coping capacity index scores by combining availability of skills or soft capacity andavailability of structural resources or hard coping capacity. Socio-economic resilience index scoresvaried greatly amongst subdistricts. Combining the soft and hard coping capacities, the average scoreacross districts in both provinces was 3 out of a possible 4, meaning that most of the districts werelargely resilient. However, variations also existed by subdistrict. Few subdistricts in both Krabi andNakhon Si Thammarat provinces had low coping capacity index scores between 1 and 2 out of 4.District averages of socio-economic resilience scores mask the variations at subdistrict level. Morestudies with rigorous methodologies at village or neighborhood level is needed to obtain a nuancedunderstanding of community resilience to hydrometeorological hazards.Keywords: socio-economic; resilience; floods; vulnerability; coping capacity1. IntroductionIn recent years, hydrometeorological hazards have become more frequent and severe,with increasing loss of life and damage to livelihoods, property, and infrastructure [1].Coastal areas in Thailand face recurring flooding situations resulting in communitiesand individuals adopting a range of coping mechanisms [2]. Coping capacity entails tothe ability of people, organizations, and systems, using available skills and resources,Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7316. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19127316 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerphInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7316 2 of 13to manage adverse conditions, risk, or disasters [3]. Following the floods in 2004, theThai Red Cross, in partnership with other agencies, with funding from United NationsDevelopment Programme, implemented a project in three provinces namely Nakhon SiThammarat, Phatthalung, and Trang to strengthen the adaptive capacity of vulnerablecoastal communities in Thailand to climate change related risks and weather events [4].The action plans implemented in three provinces, including mud dredging alongcoastlines, community training, water management by community, alternative rice pro-duction techniques, community zoning, shoreline protection, etc. [4]. Individual copingstrategies without collective action may not be effective solutions due to the occurrence ofnegative externalities if neighbors do not apply/maintain their own protection structures.Following the 2004 Tsunami, households in Ban Nam Khem community started collectivelyimplementing regular tsunami drills, pick-up services for elderly people in the case of anemergency, or the planning of escape routes and tsunami shelters [5].Recent studies have emphasized the need to understand community resilience todisasters [6]. Efforts to increase community resilience to natural hazards should be guidedby the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030 [7]. This starts withgaining a better understanding of disaster risk and strengthening disaster risk governanceto manage the risk, instead of managing the disaster after it happens [8]. Exposure isdefined as the situation of people, infrastructure, housing, production capacities, andother tangible human assets located in hazard-prone areas [9], whereas vulnerability isthe conditions determined by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors orprocesses which increase the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets, or systemsto the impacts of hazards [10]. Resilience is defined as the ability of a system, communityor society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate, adapt to, transform, andrecover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including throughthe preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions through riskmanagement [11].A previous study revealed that mapping urban resilience poses a challenge to reflectthe systematic property of resilience [12]. Several studies showed disaster managementapproach in the mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery phases using flood hazardmap, hospital evacuation transportation model, livelihood vulnerability index (LVI), modelsuitability matrix, and investments in flood protection [13–17]. Different models have beenused in the past to examine resilience to different hazards and disasters. One well-knownapproach is to improve comparative assessments of disaster resilience at the communitylevel. The Disaster Resilience of Place (DROP) model was developed to address resilienceto natural disasters [18]. The DROP model was used at the provincial level across Thailand.Results of the model suggest that while disaster resilience is generally higher in the moreurbanized areas, communities located in rural areas in Thailand may not necessarily beless resilient to the impacts of disasters. The role of place in disaster resilience needs tobe considered in any resilience model, as indicators need to capture the unique culturaland structural characteristics of the study area [6]. The assessment of resilience againstsocio-economic and health risks should be a concern in the urban resilience assessment [19].There is a dearth of information with respect to two of the coastal provinces in Thai-land namely Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat in terms of the resilience of the communitiesand their coping mechanisms to climate related hazards. The study sought to providea quantitative socio-economic assessment of the two provinces to understand their vul-nerability to hydrometeorological hazards of varying magnitudes; and to come up withsocio-economic resilience index scores as well as some insights on the coping mechanismsbeing adopted. The main contributions this study makes relate to understanding the socio-economic resilience to floods, vulnerability, and coping capacity, as well as insights serve toguide future research on resilience to floods.Int.

Data AnalysisSimple descriptive analyses were conducted, focusing on the distribution of differentvariables within the two coastal provinces. The social and economic dimensions werethen combined to produce socio-economic resilience index scores and maps for the twocoastal provinces.In this investigation, resilience to hydrometeorological hazards was considered afunction of exposure, vulnerability, and coping capacity as shown in Table 2. Populationdensity at subdistrict level was the only exposure variable and was measured on a scalefrom 0 to 5, with 5 representing the highest level of exposure. Several variables wereconsidered under the dimension on vulnerability, and the same scale from 0 to 5 wasapplied, with 5 representing greatest level of vulnerability. Combining the exposure andvulnerability variables, we derived socio-economic resilience index scores from 0 to 45,with lower scores representing greater resilience.Coping capacity referred to the availability of skills (soft coping capacities) and struc-tural resources (hard coping capacities) to help communities manage and respond tohydrometeorological hazards. Based on readily available data, the only variable consideredunder soft coping capacity was literacy rate, and this was measured on a scale from 0 to1, with 1 representing an area had a literacy rate greater or equal to 90%. A community’scapacity to cope requires continuing awareness amongst the population, hence, the inclu-sion of literacy rate. For the hard coping capacities, the study took into consideration theavailability of a hospital at subdistrict, district/provincial levels as well as telecommunica-tion development. Combining the soft and hard coping capacities, the study then derivedand mapped the coping capacity index scores ranging from 0 to 4, with 4 representing themaximum possible coping capacity.3. Results3.1. Exposure and VulnerabilityAs of 2017, most of the administrative units in both Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarathad a population density of 1 to 200 persons per square kilometer as shown in Figure 2.Int.

While the majority of subdistricts in Nakhon Si Thammarat had an infant population ranging from 0.9% to 1.2%, most subdistricts in Krabi had a higher proportion of infants, ranging from 1.3% to 1.7%, as shown in Figure 3a. Most subdistricts in Krabi had a higher proportion of children under five years of age compared to Nakhon Si Thammarat. For Nakhon Si Thammarat, subdistricts closer to the border with Krabi exhibited a similar pattern as shown in Figure 3b. Overall, most subdistricts in Nakhon Si Thammarat had a greater proportion of population aged 60 years and over, ranging from 15.1% to greater than 20% as shown in Figure 3c.   Figure 2.

Numbers of orphans and homelesspeople were very small in both provinces. Only one subdistrict in Nakhon Si Thammarathad more than 400 orphans and homeless people, as shown in Figure 3e. All subdistricts inboth provinces had disabled persons. Only one district (Mueang Krabi) in Krabi comparedto three districts (Tha Sala, Mueang Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Thung Song) in Nakhon SiThammarat had at least 750 persons living with disabilities as shown in Figure 3f. Chronicdiseases were prevalent in both provinces. Most subdistricts in both Krabi and Nakhon SiThammarat provinces had more than 7% of their population living with a particular chronicailment as shown in Figure 3g.

Discussion The study conducted a quantitative socio-economic assessment of the resilience and coping capacities of communities in two coastal provinces, Krabi and Nakhon Si Tham-marat, regarding hydrometeorological hazards. The study suggested that more areas within Krabi than Nakhon Si Thammarat province were more vulnerable to the effects of hydrometeorological hazards. This could be explained by the fact that most subdistricts in Krabi were more densely populated with higher proportions of children under 5 and adults compared to subdistricts in Nakhon Si Thammarat province. Results showed variations in total socio-economic resilience index scores at subdis-trict level. District averages of socio-economic resilience scores tend to mask the variations Figure 5.

DiscussionThe study conducted a quantitative socio-economic assessment of the resilience andcoping capacities of communities in two coastal provinces, Krabi and Nakhon Si Tham-marat, regarding hydrometeorological hazards. The study suggested that more areaswithin Krabi than Nakhon Si Thammarat province were more vulnerable to the effects ofhydrometeorological hazards. This could be explained by the fact that most subdistrictsin Krabi were more densely populated with higher proportions of children under 5 andadults compared to subdistricts in Nakhon Si Thammarat province.Results showed variations in total socio-economic resilience index scores at subdistrictlevel. District averages of socio-economic resilience scores tend to mask the variations at sub-district level. Similar findings were reported in an earlier study [6], and a recommendationwas put forward to conduct more studies with rigorous methodologies at microlevel, i.e., atvillage or neighborhood level to get a nuanced understanding of community resilience.In both Krabi and Nakhon Si Thammarat provinces, few subdistricts recorded copingcapacity index scores between 1 and 2 out of 4. This was even though all subdistricts had aliteracy rate between 90% and 95% among people aged 6 years and above. In addition, allsubdistricts in both provinces were at least covered by either a functional hospital, either atcommunity level, district level, or regional level. Future research could examine furtherthe differences at more granular level to understand the variability in coping capacitiesby district.The study had its own limitations. First, the study used overall literacy rates amongpeople aged 6 years and above as the sole proxy indicator for communities’ soft copingcapacities. Literacy rates at regional level were applied at subdistrict level, and this masksthe actual variations. Literacy in terms of disaster response could be different, as it includesInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 7316 12 of 13the application of local knowledge gained from experience based on past disaster exposure.Second, community resilience and coping capacities were assessed at subdistrict level.Future studies could focus on a more granular geographic scale to provide a more in-depthunderstanding on the variability of disaster resilience within the coastal provinces of Krabiand Nakhon Si Thammarat. Third, the study did not have a control area to use as acomparison that all study areas were prone to flooding.5. ConclusionsIn conclusion, the study makes explicit the realization that overall resilience at amacrolevel masks the greater variations at granular, localized geographical scales. Accuratemeasurement of a community’s circumstances before an adverse event is pre-requisitetoward enhanced knowledge of a community’s capacity to adapt, respond to, and recoverfrom hydrometeorological hazards. The challenge in update and apply lessons learnt eitherfrom historical experience or current insight are key points. Making better use acrossexisting research is important for understanding the resilience to floods.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, U.L. and P.C.; methodology, U.L. and P.C.; validation, U.L.and D.T.R.; formal analysis, U.L. and D.T.R.; investigation, U.L.; resources, U.L.; data curation, U.L.and D.T.R.; writing—original draft preparation, D.T.R.; writing—review and editing, U.L., D.T.R.,P.C., K.N. and C.M.; visualization, P.C.; supervision, K.N. and C.M.; project administration, K.N. andC.M.
