What economic complexity theory can tell us about the EU’s pandemic recovery and resilience plans

What	economic	complexity	theory	can	tell	us	aboutthe	EU’s	pandemic	recovery	and	resilience	plansA	little	over	a	year	ago,	the	EU’s	political	leaders	agreed	on	an	unprecedented	fiscal	package	–	dubbed	‘NextGeneration	EU’	–	to	aid	Europe’s	recovery	from	the	pandemic.	Ricardo	Hausmann,	Miguel	Angel	Santos,Corrado	Macchiarelli	and	Renato	Giacon	write	that	economic	complexity	theories	can	provide	a	useful	tool	forevaluating	whether	the	recovery	and	resilience	plans	submitted	by	EU	member	states	to	receive	this	funding	arewell-designed.	Assessing	the	case	of	Greece,	they	argue	that	investments	should	be	tailored	toward	export-oriented	sectors	and	aim	to	help	close	the	country’s	product	complexity	gap	with	other	EU	states.There	is	increasing	evidence	that	directing	investments	towards	more	complex	and	less	ubiquitous	products	canhelp	countries	improve	growth	prospects,	without	undermining	the	importance	of	the	accumulation	of	factors	ofproduction	such	as	physical	and	human	capital,	or	the	role	of	institutional	measures	such	as	good	governance	andthe	rule	of	law.	Complexity	itself	must	build	on	a	strong	path	dependence	of	incrementing	each	country’s	pasteconomic	capabilities.The	EU	Recovery	and	Resilience	Facility	(RRF),	as	the	centrepiece	of	the	Next	Generation	EU	(NGEU)	programmelaunched	in	July	2020,	enshrines	the	twin	priorities	of	a	‘green’	and	‘digital’	transition,	focusing	on	raising	the	EU’spotential	growth,	improving	long-term	fiscal	sustainability,	and	helping	economic	convergence	across	the	Union,rather	than	achieving	short-term	fiscal	stabilisation	after	the	Covid-19	pandemic.Could	theories	on	economic	complexity	be	used	to	assess	the	validity	of	the	Recovery	and	Resilience	Facility?	Weargue	that	the	deployment	of	EU	funds	and	the	frontloading	of	reforms	in	some	key	areas	in	the	context	of	the	RRFshould	find	their	natural	place	in	the	Economic	Complexity	Index	(ECI)	theory	(equally	interesting	are	the	GreenComplexity	Index	(GCI)	and	Green	Complexity	Potential	(GCP)	theories)	which	should	inform	the	implementation	ofnational	Recovery	and	Resilience	Plans	(RRPs)	based	on	each	EU	member	state’s	sectorial	and	productivestructure.With	billions	of	euros	of	grants	and	concessional	loans	to	be	spent	across	the	EU,	it	is	of	paramount	importancethat	investments	and	reforms	are	well	targeted,	growth-enhancing	and	build	on	a	consolidated	methodologicalframework	in	order	to	have	a	significant	multiplier	effect	on	the	wider	economy.	This	represents	a	crucial	step	toboost	future	economic	growth	and	convergence	in	the	EU,	particularly	for	the	less	diversified	member	states	in	theSouthern	and	South-Eastern	EU	Periphery.	Here,	we	look	at	the	implementation	of	the	Greek	Recovery	andResilience	Plan	(known	as	‘Greece	2.0’)	and	evaluate	the	future	use	of	EU	Recovery	Funds	against	the	backdrop	ofthe	country’s	product	space	and	comparative	advantages.Complexity	theoriesAccording	to	economic	complexity	theory,	countries	tend	to	converge	to	the	level	of	income	dictated	by	thecomplexity	of	their	productive	structure.	The	concept	of	economic	complexity	is	itself	defined	by	a	country’s	nationalindicator	(i.e.	the	Economic	Complexity	Index	or	ECI)	measuring	the	capabilities	and	know-how	embedded	in	theproduction	of	goods	and	services.The	index	is	calculated	as	a	summary	measure	between	a	country’s	diversification	(the	number	of	products	that	acountry	exports	with	a	revealed	comparative	advantage)	and	a	product’s	ubiquity	(the	number	of	countries	withrevealed	comparative	advantages	in	that	particular	product).	Economic	growth	is	therefore	driven	by	diversificationinto	new	products	that	are	incrementally	more	complex	and	less	ubiquitous.	It	follows	that	efforts	from	policy-makers	should	concentrate	on	creating	the	conditions	that	would	allow	complexity	to	favour	sustained	and	long-term	growth	driven	by	a	process	of	diversifying	knowhow	to	produce	a	broader,	and	increasingly	more	complex,	setof	goods	and	services.There	is	evidence	that	the	ECI	is	a	good	predictor	of	economic	growth	over	the	long-term.	In	the	context	of	the	EU,the	results	suggest	that	economic	convergence	is	much	faster	for	countries	whose	exports	are	more	complex	thanwhat	should	be	expected	for	their	income	level.LSE European Politics and Policy (EUROPP) Blog: What economic complexity theory can tell us about the EU’s pandemic recovery and resilience plans Page 1 of 10		Date originally posted: 2021-08-30Permalink: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2021/08/30/what-economic-complexity-theory-can-tell-us-about-the-eus-pandemic-recovery-and-resilience-plans/Blog homepage: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/Based	on	an	extension	of	the	concept	of	economic	complexity,	economists	at	the	Institute	for	New	EconomicThinking	have	more	recently	created	a	new	measure	which	aims	to	capture	the	extent	to	which	countries	are	able	toexport	green	and	technologically	sophisticated	products	in	a	competitive	manner.	Countries	with	high	GreenComplexity	Indices	(GCIs)	tend	to	have	significantly	higher	environmental	patenting	rates,	lower	CO2	emissionsand	more	stringent	environmental	policies	–	even	after	controlling	for	their	GDP	per	capita.	Linked	to	the	GCI	is	theconcept	of	Green	Complexity	Potential	(GCP),	assessing	each	country’s	average	relatedness	to	green	complexproducts	which	a	country	is	not	yet	competitive	in.Economic	complexity	and	the	Covid-19	pandemicThe	impact	of	the	Covid-19	shock	in	the	EU	has	been	extremely	heterogeneous	across	countries	and	sectors,suggestive	of	a	significant	reallocation	of	resources	as	economies	recover.	It	should	come	as	no	surprise	thatcountries	which	had	a	diversified	productive	system	and	relative	advantage	in	more	sophisticated	and	tradablesectors	fared	comparatively	better	than	others.For	instance,	the	digital	and	healthcare	industries	have	performed	well	from	the	start	of	the	pandemic;	equally,enabling	industries	like	chemicals	and	the	agribusiness	sector	are	experiencing	a	faster	recovery.	On	the	otherhand,	sectors	dependent	on	human	interaction,	such	as	the	transport	services,	tourism	services,	hospitality	andcatering	industries,	large	sectors	of	retail	trade	and	business	delivering	personal	services,	as	well	as	cultural	andcreative	industries,	have	suffered	the	most.

Considering	2020	and	2021	cumulative	annualGDP	growth	(Figure	2),	countries	with	a	less	diversified	industrial	and	export	base,	more	reliance	on	tourism	andless	sophisticated	industries	(construction,	hospitality,	etc)	such	as	Cyprus,	Greece,	Portugal,	Spain,	and	Croatiahave	faced	more	severe	output	losses	after	the	pandemic	struck	and	are	taking	longer	to	recover.	To	a	certaindegree,	as	important	as	the	level	of	economic	complexity	is,	an	important	role	is	played	by	the	rate	at	whichcomplexity	evolves	over	time.	While	the	more	mature	EU	economies	have	seen	their	complexity	index	remainingbroadly	stable	or	even	decreasing	slightly	over	time,	most	Central	and	Eastern	European	countries	have	seen	animprovement	in	their	complexity	standing.Figure	2:	Economic	complexity	and	GDPSource:	Authors’	calculations	based	on	Harvard	Growth	Lab’s	Atlas	of	Economic	Complexity	Ranking	&	IMF	WEO	April	2021	Database.The	EU	recovery	funds	as	an	opportunity	to	increase	‘complexity’The	EU’s	broad-based	response	to	the	Covid-19	pandemic	feeds	into	the	debate	on	the	limited	fiscal	Europeanresources	that	were	diverted	to	fight	the	Eurozone	crisis,	with	markets	left	wondering	whether	public	backstopswould	be	enough	to	stop	financial	contagion.Since	2020,	EU	member	states	and	European	financial	institutions	have	put	together	several	measures	to	cushionthe	immediate	effects	of	the	pandemic.

In	their	sample	of	128	countries,	Greece	had	thelargest	gap	between	the	recorded	level	of	income	and	the	productive	knowledge-content	of	its	exports.	For	manyyears,	especially	before	the	European	debt	crisis	struck	in	2010,	Greece	owed	its	income	mainly	to	borrowedforeign	spending,	historically	producing	few	exports	in	machinery,	electronics,	and	chemicals.Figure	5:	Greece’s	product	space	in	the	Growth	Lab’s	ECI	Index	in	2019LSE European Politics and Policy (EUROPP) Blog: What economic complexity theory can tell us about the EU’s pandemic recovery and resilience plans Page 6 of 10		Date originally posted: 2021-08-30Permalink: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2021/08/30/what-economic-complexity-theory-can-tell-us-about-the-eus-pandemic-recovery-and-resilience-plans/Blog homepage: https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/Source:	Harvard	Growth	Lab’s	Atlas	of	Economic	Complexity	Ranking:	https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/countries/90/export-complexityOver	the	past	decade,	Greece	has	added	13	new	goods	products	to	its	productive	capacity,	diversifying	itseconomy	into	a	few	new	manufactured	goods	but	at	too	small	a	volume	to	contribute	to	substantial	income	growth.The	recent	addition	in	the	Growth	Lab’s	Atlas	of	traded	services	has	partly	offered	a	more	complete	explanation	ofGreece’s	economic	growth	dynamics,	while	also	taking	into	account	the	relatively	high-income	for	its	low	level	ofcomplexity	(Figure	5).Service	products	such	as	transport,	tourism	and	travel	services	today	represent	over	50%	of	Greece’s	exports.These	products	have	accounted	for	the	largest	contribution	to	export	growth	in	the	country	over	the	past	decade.However,	they	have	also	suffered	the	most	during	the	Greek	sovereign	debt	crisis	and,	lately,	the	Covid-19pandemic.	Traded	services	explain	a	significant	drag	on	Greece’s	economic	performance	on	both	occasions.The	evidence	shows	that	Greece’s	existing	know-how	already	affords	many	opportunities	to	diversify	its	structureinto	related	products	via	a	so-called	Parsimonious	Industrial	Policy	Approach	to	help	jump	short	distances	tonearby,	more	complex	products.	Importantly,	Greece	ranks	first	in	the	EU	and	second	only	to	India	on	a	globalscale	in	the	“distance”	dimension,	which	measures	how	easy	it	would	be	for	a	country	to	move	to	export	morecomplex	goods.Still,	an	analysis	of	the	Greek	Recovery	and	Resilience	Plan	and	the	findings	of	the	“Development	Plan	for	theGreek	Economy”	shows	that	one	crucial	feature	of	Greece’s	poor	economic	performance	in	the	past	was	lowproductivity	and	lack	of	complexity	in	its	export	basket.

An	additional	12.7	billion	euros	will	be	disbursed	from	the	Commission	tothe	Greek	government	as	RRF	loans,	which	are	intended	to	leverage	equal	amounts	of	private	financing,	incooperation	with	European	financial	institutions	such	as	the	EBRD	and	EIB.Loans	from	the	EU,	international	financial	institutions,	and	commercial	banks,	which	will	be	deployed	under	theRRF	Greek	Corporate	Loan	Facility,	should	provide	a	further	opportunity	for	the	country	to	build	on	its	currentstrengths	to	boost	its	industrial	and	export	diversification.	They	will	also	potentially	help	Greece	to	substantiallyreallocate	economic	activity	from	low	to	high	productivity	and	complexity	sectors	and	products,	such	as	electronics,advanced	manufacturing,	industrial	machinery	and	the	decarbonisation	of	the	iron	and	steel	industries.
