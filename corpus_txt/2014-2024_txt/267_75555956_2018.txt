Abstract 
Forest and land fires in South Sumatra Province tend to be a routine disaster in the 
dry season. The handling of forest and land fires needs to be linked to socio-economic 
resilience in order to be completely resolved. This study measures socio-economic resilience 
and links it with forest and land fires. The method used is qualitative analysis using the 
resilience concept of UNISDR. The result shows that all socio-economic resilience indicators 
in facing the disaster have been done by South Sumatera Provincial Government but not yet 
maximal. Some indicators that need to be improved are the diversification of local economic 
activities, the implementation of contingency plans in the event of a disaster, the 
establishment of incentives and clear penalties, and the increase of multi-stakeholder 
participation.  
 
Keywords: socio economic resilience, land and forest fire disaster, disaster mitigation, 
disaster  risk reduction, emergency respons, karhutla. 
 
Introduction 
Disasters, both natural and social, are challenges and risks that will continue to be 
faced and need to be anticipated by the Indonesian nation (White Paper of Defense, 2014). 
The smoke disaster triggered by forest and land fires (karhutla) is one of the most interesting 
disasters to be studied. As a form of transnational environmental pollution, in addition 
impacting the health and feasibility of air ecosystems at the local and national levels, smoke 
haze generated from forest fires in Indonesia has also affected the survival and economic 
activities of some other countries within the ASEAN regional (Bram, 2012). 
Karhutla is actually not new for Indonesia. Indonesia had experienced considerable 
karhutla in 1997/1998. When it happened, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused 
Indonesia to experience the greatest forest fire disaster in the world (Tacconi, 2003). Table 1 
shows some of the large scale karhutla that have occurred in Indonesia.

Sumatra and Kalimantan always experience karhutla every year (Wardani, 2004). 
Both islands have large forests and many flammable peatlands. One of the provinces which 
always experience karhutla every year is South Sumatera Province. All 
districts/municipalities in South Sumatra Province are included in the high risk of karhutla 
disaster (BNPB, 2014). Forest and land fires occurring in South Sumatera in 2015 mostly occur 
in Ogan Komering Ilir, Musi Banyuasin, and Banyuasin. All three districts are suffering 
severe karhutla because the peatlands in the region are burnt so it is difficult to extinguish. 
The peat lands in these three districts are the largest peat land in South Sumatera Province. In 
addition, the karhutla that occurred in 2015 is more common in forested areas. 
The condition of all districts/municipalities which is classified as high risk of 
exposure to karhutla in South Sumatera Province is actually very harmful. This is because the 
agricultural sector, including forestry, is one of the three largest contributors to regional GDP 
over the last 5 years (BPS South Sumatra Province). In addition, the province of South 
Sumatra also holds enormous potential because of its natural wealth not only from the 
agricultural sector but also from the mining sector. The mining and quarrying sector is the 
largest sector of GDP . 
Karhutla in South Sumatra Province needs to be completely resolved because this 
province is one of the richest provinces in Indonesia. In addition, South Sumatra is also 
planned as one of the locations of Asian Summer Games (Asian Games) in 2018. 
The direct impact of karhutla is the occurrence of a smoke disaster. The smoke 
disaster has disrupted various aspects of people's lives. Although the smoke disaster did not 
cause direct casualties, the smoke disaster caused many residents with respiratory problems. 
In South Sumatera, the number of people with Acute Respiratory Infection at the peak of 
karhutla reaches 83,484 people (Bappeda Provinsi Sumatera Selatan, 2015). 
The smoke disaster in South Sumatera Province has also resulted in a decrease in 
visibility that affects the disruption of flight schedules. Visibility in the Province of South 
Sumatra as of October 9, 2015 is only 600 m. In addition, the number of Air Pollution 
Standard Index in South Sumatera Province also shows the air quality is at a dangerous level 
(497).The impacts of karhutla can affect the social and economic resilience of the people. 
UNISDR in 2012 has developed models of disaster resilience and sustainable development 
implemented in four areas: political-institutional, social, environmental and economic 
(United Nation Internasional Strategi for Disaster Reduction, 2012). This study will measure 
the socio-economic resilience of South Sumatra Province using a model of resiliency from 
UNISDR and link it to forest and land fires. 
 
Researh Method 
Data collection techniques in this study were conducted by collecting primary data. 
Primary data collection is done by purposive sampling technique, which is choosing a 
resource for a particular reason. The reason is the knowledge of resource persons on karhutla 
problem in South Sumatera Province. 
Data analysis was done using Miles and Huberman model. Miles and Huberman in 
Sugiyono (Sugiyono, 2014) suggested that activities in qualitative data analysis consist of data

reduction, data presentation, and conclusion/verification. Data reduction is to summarize, 
choose the main things, focus on the things that are important, sought the theme and pattern. 
After data is reduced, the next step is data presentation. In qualitative research, the 
presentation of data can be done in the form of brief descriptions, charts, relationships 
between categories, flowcharts, and the like. Conclusions in qualitative research are new 
findings that have not previously existed. 
 
Result and Discussion 
Table 2 shows the implementation of socio-economic resilience indicator in South 
Sumatera Province. The three indicators of economic resilience used are the depiction of the 
impact of disasters on macroeconomics in the long run. From Table 2 it is seen that the 
indicators of economic resilience have been done although not yet maximal. Less than 
optimal indicators are actually caused more by the commitment of all stakeholders disaster. 
For example, incentive and penalty incentive indicators to improve resilience and encourage 
compliance with security standards, these indicators can be realized if fairness in law 
enforcement is well implemented. Violators of laws and regulations should be subject to 
sanctions in accordance with applicable and indiscriminate regulations.

The most important indicators need to be intensified are the efforts to diversify local 
economic activities and the implementation of poverty reduction. Of the five interviewees 
related to economic resilience, only 1 resource person can describe this indicator; that so far 
no effort has been made to diversify local economic activity. Efforts to diversify local 
economic activity is actually important as anticipation and steps to prevent the amount of loss 
that must be borne if karhutla occurs. Steps to diversify local economic activities can be 
applied for example by holding private parties (companies/corporations) to require them to 
hire local people to create a large business field. In addition, companies can also be required 
to set aside some of their profits in the form of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to 
improve the skills of citizens so that little by little people around the area prone to karhutla 
have other skills than farming. 
The indicator of poverty alleviation programs has been implemented in regional 
development policies. In the book of Regional Government Work Plan (RKPD) of South 
Sumatera Province in 2015 explained that poverty alleviation is one of the regional 
development priorities of South Sumatera Province in 2015. The poverty reduction effort

includes 7 affairs, namely education, health, youth and sports affairs, public works, 
agriculture, and marine and fisheries. 
The second economic resilience indicator in the 2012 model of UNISDR is to make 
contingency plans to avoid disaster losses. BPBD of South Sumatera Province stated that 
karhutla contingency plan has actually been made, but in its implementation, it has 
encountered many obstacles, including weather factor causing prolonged dry season. The key 
to the successful implementation of contingency plan is good cooperation and coordination 
among all related agencies. Each side must understand its duties properly and commit to 
carrying out the task as best as possible. 
The third indicator of economic resilience is to establish incentives and penalties to 
increase resilience and encourage compliance with security standards. All informants 
mentioned that this indicator has been done, especially in relation to law enforcement aspects 
on the prevention of karhutla. This law enforcement becomes an important aspect in the 
handling of karhutla as a preventive measure. Nevertheless, there are indications about the 
lack of firmness of this aspect of law enforcement because it is proven that karhutla always 
repeats every year. Implementation of strict and just law enforcement is key in the handling 
of karhutla and must be improved continuously. 
The analysis of social resiliency based on the 2012 UNISDR resilience model is 
presented in Table 3. Almost all the interviewees mentioned that all indicators have been 
done. Some sources mentioned that the three indicators are not yet optimal.

Indicators of provision of basic service access and post-disaster security needs have 
been done but tend not to be maximal because social activities in the form of teaching and 
learning activities were disrupted because many schools were closed when karhutla occurred. 
However, health services actually increased because the government not only conduct health 
activities such as medication, but also do anticipatory activities such as providing oxygen 
cylinders in shelters and distributing masks to the community. 
The second indicator is that the allocation of safe locations for housing and strategic 
activities has been largely done. Almost all sources said that the location of the karhutla was

not near the settlement or the house of the residents. In addition, strategic activities such as 
governance are also not disturbed. Nevertheless, one of the speakers, namely the Head of 
Health Problems Control Section of South Sumatra Provincial Health Office stated that the 
actual location of residential areas is not safe from karhutla, which is seen from the exposure 
of vast smoke and reaches to the settlement of the people. 
The third indicator is increased multi-stakeholder participation and strengthening 
networks and social ties. All informants argue that this has been done, especially with the 
existence of cross-sectoral cooperation in handling karhutla. One of the speakers, Head of 
Center for Operation Control of Regional Disaster Management Board stated that this 
indicator is not maximized because of the lack of participation and initiative of the 
community at the time of handling karhutla in 2015. However, he mentioned there are also a 
handful of people who are members of the Fire Concern Society. 
 
Relationship between Karhutla with Socio-Economic Resiliency 
According to the sources, there is a close relationship between karhutla with economic 
resiliency. This is explained as the economic motive behind the slash and burn activity to 
open the land. How to clear land, both farm, and plantation, most easily and cheaply done by 
burning the previous planting. In South Sumatra, it is known that sonor (the rice cultivation 
system in the swamp area), is only done during the long dry season. Fire is used to prepare 
the land and then the rice is grown in a way spread. Furthermore, the land is abandoned and 
only harvested 6 months later. This method is the easiest and cheapest way because it 
requires less manpower and funds. Another economic advantage of this sonor system is that 
people can get the remaining fish in the swamp. 
Karhutla belonging to the slow-onset disasters category will likely have a wider and 
longer-term impact. This long-term impact will also affect macroeconomic variables such as 
the level of community savings, investment, domestic demand in aggregate, and lower 
productive capacity. 
The close relationship between karhutla with economic resilience provides a clear 
perspective on how to handle karhutla so as not to be a protracted problem. Steps that must 
be done is to help provide the resources needed by the community to open the land. These 
resources should not be money because they are vulnerable to misuse. The resources in 
question can be in the form of equipment and man power. Provision of equipment can be 
done by cooperating with companies located close to the prone areas of burning. A binding 
and decisive agreement is required, i.e. the company should not open the land by burning 
and should help the surrounding community to open the land in a conventional manner 
(without burning). The agreement must be associated with the company's permission to be 
properly implemented. If necessary, the government can also mobilize military forces to help 
people clear land. This is included in the effort to prevent the karhutla disaster so that the 
involvement of military force can be covered by the concept of military operation other than 
war. 
Most of the speakers mentioned that the social life of the people is not too affected by 
the karhutla. The education sector was disrupted due to karhutla, with the absence of several 
schools. However, the social condition of the community is relatively little changed with the 
occurrence of karhutla. People working in the office keep working as usual. Government 
activities and community services continue to run regularly. Local governments also not 
collapse, but only need assistance from the central government. 
Social toughness tends to be unaffected by the existence of karhutla because 
community behavior in the form of burning land to open agricultural land and plantation has 
become a habit. This makes people as familiar with karhutla happenings that occur every

year so they tend to adapt because they have no other choice. How to adapt them is by using 
a mask when traveling out of the house. One resource person, the Head of Health Problems 
Control Section, South Sumatra Provincial Health Officer, stated that the impact of karhutla, 
especially in the health sector, will only be visible in the long term so it is difficult to measure 
and the community relatively ignore it because the impact cannot be not seen instantly. He 
also mentioned that the best thing that should be done by the community when its 
environment is affected by the smoke disaster is to evacuate to a safe place and free from 
smoke. But in reality, this is almost impossible to do by most people because of the 
limitations in terms of economy and resources. 
 
Conclusion and Suggestions 
Conclusion 
Based on the descriptions described in the preceding sections, it can be concluded as 
follows: 
a. There are some indicators that need to be improved to achieve better socio-economic 
resilience in facing karhutla disaster in South Sumatra. These indicators include the 
diversification of local economic activities, the implementation of contingency plans in the 
event of a disaster, the establishment of incentives and clear penalties, and the increase of 
multi-stakeholder participation. 
b. There is a close relationship between karhutla and economic resiliency. This is explained by 
all sources as the economic motive behind the slash and burn activity. The karhutla 
relationship with social resiliency tends to be weak, that is, most of the speakers 
mentioned that social life at the district/city level is not significantly affected by karhutla. 
 
Suggestions 
Suggestions from the results of research are as follows: 
a. Practical suggestions: 
1) The core problem of karhutla is the limited resources owned by the community to open the 
land. Therefore, the government should help provide the necessary resources such as 
equipment to clear the land. The provision of this equipment can be done by cooperating 
with companies located close to the prone areas. If necessary, the government can also 
mobilize military forces to help people clear land. This military engagement is done in the 
context of karhutla disaster prevention so that it can use the approach of Military 
Operational Concept Other Than War. 
2) Forest and land fires can be minimized if prevented from the outset, especially by 
preventing peat lands from burning. Commitment from all parties, whether government, 
private, or community, is needed so that the handling of forest and land fire disaster can 
be effective. This commitment can be realized for example through a memorandum of 
understanding and cooperation agreement, and also strengthened with binding reward 
and penalty. 
3) Law enforcement related to karhutla needs to be firmly implemented. Local governments 
should act fairly to implement existing regulations, both to individuals and companies. 
This is important to provide a deterrent effect. 
b. Theoretical suggestions: 
1) For more intensive results, research that measures socioeconomic toughness on a smaller, 
community-level, family, and individual level is necessary. 
2) Further research can add inferential statistical analysis to obtain more comprehensive 
results.
