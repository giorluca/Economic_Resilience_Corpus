Results show that the system is vulnerable to global change, 20 especially in the long-term, and that adaptation actions can save between 3 and 65 M€/year. 21 Introduction 22 Despite uncertainties in climate projections, global warming is unequivocal (IPCC 2013) and its 23 impact is an important topic in many fields. Water resource management impacts of climate change 24 and economic assessment of adaptive strategies becomes essential. In Europe, EU water and climate 25 policies require water management to consider adaptation to climate change, with many policy and 26 scientific challenges. Scientific research is essential for ensuring that new river basin management 27 plans will be “climate proof” (Quevauviller et al. 2012), which requires development of adequate 28 methods, planning and governance processes for integrating climate change into water management 29 (EC 2012). 30 Although many studies quantify potential effects of climate change on water resource systems at 31 basin scale (e.g. review in Vicuna and Dracup, 2007), there is now the challenge of developing 32 methods to assess and select climate change adaptation strategies. Very few studies have addressed 33 the selection and assessment of potential adaptation actions for water resource systems at a basin or 34 system scale. 35 Closer integration of the assessment of socioeconomic vulnerabilities and adaptive capacity and 36 physical impacts is more likely to yield more robust adaptations to the uncertain future scenarios 37 (Ekstrom et al. 2013; Girard et al. 2015a and 2015b; Wilby et al. 2009). In this sense, hydroeconomic 38 models (HEM) (Harou et al. 2009; Heinz et al. 2007; Pulido-Velazquez et al. 2008) are a step further 39 in the use of water management models to assess and select adaptation strategies, by integrating 40 hydrologic, engineering, environmental and economic aspects of water resources systems.  41 —3—  HEM can help design economically efficient policies, analyze economic impacts of variations in 42 water deliveries in different sectors (economic losses from water scarcity) and assess the benefits of 43 implementing different policies, through the use of economic water demand functions. HEM also 44 has been used to value the potential of different economic policy instruments such as water markets 45 (Erfani et al. 2014; Pulido-Velazquez et al. 2006) or water pricing (Pulido-Velazquez et al. 2013; 46 Macian-Sorribes et al., 2015; Riegels et al. 2013). 47 Although HEM has been implemented widely with different approaches, few examples have 48 addressed the impacts of climate change on water resource systems (Hurd and Coonrod 2012; 49 Tanaka et al. 2006; Molina et al., 2013; Yang et al. 2013), and fewer studies have assessed not only 50 the costs (as in Girard et al., 2015c) but also the benefits on the selection of potential adaptation 51 actions (Connell-Buck et al. 2011; Medellin-Azuara et al. 2008). 52 Two challenging issues when using HEMs are to assess climate change impacts are the downscaling 53 and hydrological simulation of climate projections, and the definition of indicators for assessing the 54 system performance. 55 Regarding the first issue, climate change analyses are often based on climate model predictions, but 56 water resource system analysis requires higher resolution than those provided by global climate 57 models (GCM). Dynamic downscaled climate models using regional climate models (RCM) have 58 been developed last decades for high-resolution applications over the world. European Union (EU) 59 funded project ENSEMBLES runs multiple regional climate models over the same grid to improve 60 the accuracy and reliability of its forecasts (van der Linden and Mitchell 2009). However, the 61 resolution of a RCM is not enough for most hydrological models, and further downscaling and bias-62 correction is needed (Fowler et al. 2007). Though there is an extensive literature on the strengths 63 and weaknesses of methods for downscaling climatic variables to allow results to be obtained for 64 smaller cells, fewer studies focus on uncertainties related to downscaling to the resolution needed to 65 —4—  assess the impacts of climate change on water resources systems (Cayan et al. 2008; Fowler et al. 66 2007; Seiller and Anctil 2014). 67 Another key issue is the global assessment of water resource system performance. Several authors 68 propose different indices to condense the outputs of water management models, usually involving 69 the concepts of reliability, vulnerability, sustainability or resilience (Asefa et al. 2014; Ashofteh et al. 70 2013; Martin-Carrasco and Garrote 2007; El-Baroudy and Simonovic 2004; Hashimoto et al. 1982a 71 and 1982b). However, there is a gap regarding indicators integrating the economic performance of 72 the water system using hydroeconomic models. 73 In this paper we address these both gaps. We deal with downscaling climate projections and 74 simulating hydrology according to these projections by using for first time in the selected basin a 75 spatially-distributed downscaling method for climate change projections that selects best-fitting 76 models to historic conditions. Secondly, we analyze the performance of the system for addressing 77 climate change vulnerability using performance indices—including a newly defined economic 78 index—to help in the design of adaptive strategies. 79 This paper develops a framework to assess climate change impacts and the performance of adaptive 80 strategies in water resource systems at different time horizons using a HEM, and applies the model 81 to the Jucar River basin, Spain. Hydrologic inputs are updated to the latest climatic dataset available, 82 analyzing the main output variables of ENSEMBLES project and downscaling them over the basin 83 to include the spatial variability of the climate change effects. Using generated inflows and projecting 84 future demands, we run a simulation model of the Jucar River system developed on the DSS 85 AQUATOOL (Andreu et al. 1996) in order to obtain the system performance for each climate 86 scenario. The economic assessment is obtained by applying scarcity cost functions to the outputs of 87 the water management model. We evaluate the system using indices that condense the general status, 88 —5—  using common indices cited in the literature and a new economic index, named Economic Loss Index. 89 Finally, we define four adaptive strategies to climate change, using the model for each new strategy-90 scenario combination to estimate the system performance and corresponding economic impacts.  91 Some studies have estimated previously the hydrologic impacts of climate change in the Jucar River 92 Basin (Chirivella Osma 2010; Estrela et al. 2012; Ferrer et al. 2012), but it is the first time that the 93 economic impacts and the potential economic benefits of adaptive strategies are assessed in this 94 basin. 95 In the remainder of the paper, we first present the methods, then we describe the case study, 96 afterwards we present the main results obtained, and finally we discuss the results and conclusions. 97 Methods 98 Overall description 99 Integrated assessment of climate change impacts on water resource systems typically requires a 100 variety of models used sequentially (Wilby et al. 2009; Girard et al., 2015a). The method used here 101 employs climate, hydrology, crop water requirements, statistical, water management and hydro-102 economic models to obtain final results (Figure 1). 103 HERE: Figure 1: Flow chart representing the methodological framework applied [double-lined boxes represent input 104 data, dashed boxes denote models or processes applied, and solid boxes indicate intermediate or final results]. 105 Selection of best-fitting regional climate models from ENSEMBLES projections 106 The development of the future inflow and demand scenarios begin with selecting the climate 107 projections. We based the selection on the climate models’ ability to reproduce observed conditions 108 over the historic period. A multi-objective analysis is used to select the best-fitting RCMs from the 109 ENSEMBLES project to the historic data for the Jucar River basin. 110 —6—  Assuming that best-fitting RCMs to historical data provide reliable climate change projections to the 111 local conditions, the selection is based in the comparison of monthly mean and standard deviation 112 of temperature and precipitation of historical data with the RCMs from the ENSEMBLES project, 113 using GIS tools to aggregate spatially the variables. 114 To summarize the goodness-of-fit of the ENSEMBLES RCMs, we define an index (Id) as the sum 115 (over the 12 months of the average year) of the absolute value of relative distance between historic 116 dataset (D) and control period (C) for the mean and the standard deviation of P and T: 117   118 From these results, we develop a multi-objective analysis to find models that are “inferiors” to 119 others in fitting the historical dataset. We compared all the models and discarded models that are 120 “worse” than any other model in all the statistics (sum of absolute value of the relative distance of 121 the mean and standard deviation of temperature and precipitation), i.e., strictly dominated or inferior 122 solutions. We applied this approach to select the best-fit RCMs of ENSEMBLES to the historic 123 dataset. 124 Generation of future climate scenarios  125 Once the best-fitting RCMs are selected, we obtain the future baseline scenarios of climatic data at 126 the local scale required for assessing impacts on the water resource system using a variation of the 127 statistical delta-change downscaling method (Diaz-Nieto and Wilby 2005; Fowler et al. 2007). We 128 perturbed the observed time series (mean air temperature, T, and precipitation, P, over the 1961-129 1990 control period) by modifying mean and standard deviation of the original observations through 130 the application to the historical time series of the relative change in those statistics between the 131 control and future time series. For that purpose, we first obtained the monthly relative change of 132 121ii DCDiiiId 121ii DCDiiiId—7—  mean and standard deviation for P and T for the short-term scenario (2011-2040), mid-term 133 scenario (2041-2070) and long-term scenario (2071-2100). This procedure, also applied in Pulido-134 Velazquez et al. (2014), extends a method developed originally for perturbing streamflow series in 135 Pulido-Velazquez et al. (2011), adapted for spatially distributed climatic data. For each cell of the 136 RCMs considered, the procedure involves these steps: 137 i. First, we standardize the monthly historical data time series hD (for P and T) using the 138 corresponding monthly means and standard deviations 139  140 where x represents years and j varies from 1 to 12 representing the months of a year in the series. 141 The product x.j represents the number of months in the series. y is the standardized time series 142 ii. We obtain the average relative change on mean and standard deviation (for the 12 values that 143 correspond to the average year) between the control (cM)and the future (fM) series derived from 144 the RCMs  145    and    146 iii. Finally, we obtain the future time series ( ) applying the relatives changes in both statistics 147 to the historical standardized series as 148  149 where   and  ; hD refers to the historic 150 timeseries and fG, to the generated climate change or future scenario series. 151 )()()(·.DjDjjxDDjxhhhhy )()()(MjMjMjjccf )()()(MjMjMjjccfjxGf·)()()·( ··DjDjxNGjjxG fhyff  )1)·(()( jDjGj hf   )1)·(()( jDjGj hf  —8—  Generation of future inflow scenarios 152 For generating the future inflow time series we first calibrate a rainfall-runoff model using the 153 historical data and then the future scenarios are obtained by simulating the modified precipitation 154 and temperature time series through the process described above. The rainfall-runoff model is a 155 lumped, conceptual hydrological model (the Temez model, Temez 1977) that replicates the 156 hydrologic system through balance and transfer equations using just 4 parameters and 2 storage 157 tanks (representing the soil or unsaturated zone and the aquifer). The model is calibrated for each of 158 the 8 sub-basins considered, corresponding to the catchments of the main major reservoirs of the 159 system. 160 The model assumes that total runoff is generated by the sum of a rapid response—surface runoff—161 and a slow response—baseflow from the aquifer—. A portion T of the rainfall P becomes rainfall 162 excess while the rest is stored in the soil where is partially lost as evapotranspiration. This process is 163 mainly controlled by 2 parameters: Hmax (maximum soil moisture capacity) and C (threshold to be 164 exceeded for rainfall to generate runoff). The rainfall excess is divided into 2 components: direct 165 surface runoff and infiltration, which is driven by the parameter Imax. The infiltration is considered to 166 recharge the aquifer tank, in which groundwater discharge into the stream (baseflow) follows a 167 negative exponential function that depends on the discharge parameter α (linear reservoir model). 168 Despite its simple formulation, the Temez model has been applied widely in Spanish basins 169 obtaining good results (Estrela and Quintas 1996). 170 HERE: Figure 2: Schematic of the Temez rainfall-runoff method 171 Once the model is adjusted, we modify the climatic data using those obtained from perturbed 172 historical data with averaged selected ENSEMBLES RCMs relative changes, and run the rainfall-173 runoff model to generate the streamflow time series for the future scenarios.  174 —9—  Generation of future demands 175 Water demands for future scenario have been obtained following two different procedures for urban 176 and irrigated agriculture necessities, assuming that other demands less significant such as power 177 generations and environmental flows remain constant. For urban, we have used statistical 178 projections of populations in agreement with the forcing scenarios assumption of the ENSEMBLES 179 models using current trends of per capita water use in cities to obtain final demands.. For 180 agricultural water requirements, using climate conditions obtained before and assumptions on crop 181 acreage explained in the case study implementation model, we have followed the procedure to 182 compute crop water requirements based on FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56 (Allen et al. 183 1998). Software CropWat 8.0 for Windows, developed by the Land and Water Development 184 Division of FAO, has been used to obtain crop water requirement of each scenario, and total 185 agricultural demand is assessed accounting for the areas of each crop. CropWat calculates crop water 186 requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil, climate and crop data. The program allows 187 the development of irrigation schedules for different management conditions, so it has been used to 188 obtain monthly water demands from the different crops present in the two regions considered. 189 Simulation of climate change’s impacts on the system 190 To assess the performance of the system we use SIMGES, a simulation model of the generalized 191 DSS shell AQUATOOL (Andreu et al. 1996). SIMGES is a tool for developing integrated 192 simulation models of water resource systems, including elements such as natural streams, aquifers, 193 reservoirs, water conveyance facilities, irrigation, urban, hydropower, and operating rules to manage 194 the system. The model applies an optimization algorithm to deal with monthly decisions of water 195 allocation among competing uses, minimizing the weighted deviations from the water supply and 196 —10—  environmental flow targets. The weights are defined accordingly to the priorities of water allocation 197 defined for each demand (Andreu et al. 1996). 198 For the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario we use the historic time series. Using the inflows derived 199 from the Temez rainfall-runoff model and the demands for the different climatic scenarios, we 200 simulate each scenario (control, short-term, mid-term and long-term scenarios) with a monthly time 201 step, obtaining water shortages, reliability of deliveries to each demand, monthly flows and storages 202 among many other system variables. This is done under the assumption that the same water 203 allocation and system operating rules are maintained in the future. 204 Economic assessment of climate change impacts 205 The model uses the demand curves and time series of water allocation to assess the economic losses 206 derived from water shortages in the consumptive demands plus the variable operating costs (e.g. 207 pumping costs). 208 When a demand is not fully met, the scarcity cost is assessed as the area under the curve of the 209 functions defined above between the maximum demand and the actual water delivered. To assess 210 the scarcity cost in the climate change scenarios, the economic functions for each demand have been 211 modified to include climatic and population changes, and converting annual water deliveries in 212 m3/ha into total deliveries in Mm3/year. 213  Assessment of the system performance 214 Many indexes have been defined to assess water resources system performance after the seminal 215 work of Hashimoto et al. (1982b). Here we use four indices described before (Martin-Carrasco et al. 216 2013; Pulido-Velazquez et al. 2011, Martin-Carrasco and Garrote 2007): 217 —11—   The demand satisfaction index represents the system’s volumetric supply reliability. It is 218 computed by the equation IS=S/D, where S represents the total amount of water supplied 219 and D is the total water demand. 220  The demand reliability index represents the total delivery provided to the demand under a 221 condition of no failure (Sr) divided by the total water demand of the system, and it is 222 calculated as Ir=Sr/D. 223  The withdrawal index is defined to evaluate the percentage of water resources abstracted from 224 the system (Y) with respect to the total demand, and can be assessed as Iw=Y/D. 225  The withdrawal use index is defined to evaluate the percentage of water resources withdrawn 226 from the system to supply the demand, and it can be computed as Iu=S/Y. 227 To analyze the system performance we first calculate the demand satisfaction and demand reliability 228 indices: when the system has high values for both indices the system, it is performing well; but when 229 one index has intermediate or low values, the system is unreliable (if the demands are satisfied with 230 unreliability) or vulnerable, when the demand is not satisfied regularly. After these indices have been 231 evaluated, we obtain withdrawal indices to analyze if there is sustainability in the water use, or there 232 is excess in withdrawals for the system capacity. Depending on the problems shown by the analysis, 233 the solutions vary from demand management to improvement, better managing the whole system, 234 increasing regulation of system withdrawals or necessity of complementary resources. 235 Additionally to the indices presented, and following a similar method, we define a new index, the 236 Economic Loss Index, to assess the equity of the system assessing the relation between the demands’ 237 losses over the potential maximum loss. 238 ; 239 LCI eEL —12—  where Ce is the average annual scarcity cost and L is the maximum annual loss —obtained as the 240 integral under the demand curve between the current water deliveries and the target demand—. This 241 index is used to assess the equity of the system allocating the resources. Furthermore, it can help 242 defining adaptive strategies to improve system’s equity. 243 Adaptive strategies 244 Based on the analysis of the system performance given, the expected impacts of global change and 245 the ongoing policy debate in the basin, some potential measures for evaluation for the long-term 246 scenario are selected. To assess the effects of these measures we have run the simulation model of 247 water management and the hydro-economic analysis for each strategy and climate change scenario, 248 comparing the results with the BAU scenario. 249 Case Study Implementation 250 The Jucar Water Resource System (Jucar WRS), in eastern Spain, is the largest basin (22187 km2) and 251 the most important system with regards available water resources within the Jucar River Basin 252 District (Jucar RBD or CHJ —Confederación Hidrográfica del Júcar). 253 The Jucar WRS has a Mediterranean climate, with warm, dry summers, and mild, wet winters. With 254 an annual average precipitation of 494 mm and annual average temperature of 13.8ºC, there is a 255 steep gradient of variation between the inland and coastal regions. Total average available water 256 resources are 1668 Mm3 per year, mostly from groundwater; a 75% of the average river flow is 257 regulated with surface reservoirs being Alarcon (1118 Mm3 of useful capacity; upper basin) and 258 Tous (378 Mm3, lower basin) the largest one along the river main course, and Contreras (852 Mm3), 259 on the Cabriel river. Annual system total demand is 1639 hm3, 85% for agriculture, 13% urban uses, 260 and 2% is industrial use (CHJ 2014). 261 HERE: Figure 3: a) Jucar River Basin location; b) Main features of Jucar Water Resource System.  262 —13—  Most system demands are in the coastal regions, as the historic “Ribera del Júcar” agricultural 263 demands (including the Acequia Real del Jucar, the oldest irrigation district, founded in 1264), 264 coastal urban and industrial city-demands and the demand of the Valencia metropolitan region (with 265 a population over 1,400,000, although not fully located within the basin boundaries, receives Jucar 266 River water). The main inland demands are Albacete city (population over 170,000) and the irrigated 267 regions of Mancha Oriental. Over the last 30 years the progressive transformation of roughly 268 100,000 ha from dry to irrigated farmland in “Mancha Oriental” regions has accelerated 269 socioeconomic development based on widespread use of groundwater resources overdrafting the 270 aquifer and generating significant water conflicts downstream because of resulting streamflow 271 depletion in the connected Jucar river (Sanz et al. 2011). Climate change will likely exacerbate this 272 issue (Pulido-Velazquez et al. 2014), which demands groundwater abstraction controls, including 273 collective actions; some have been already successfully implemented (Lopez-Gunn 2003). The Jucar 274 RBD has strong interaction between surface and groundwater, which requires an integrated analysis 275 of both and models that include these interactions (Ferrer et al. 2012). 276 The calibration of the rainfall-runoff model was done using gridded climatic data for the region 277 from Herrera et al. (2012) and historical unimpaired streamflow time series from SIMPA, Spanish 278 acronym standing for “Integrated System for Rainfall-Runoff Modeling”. We used 1961-1990 as 279 calibration period, validating the model over the period 1991-2000. Total water volume, annual 280 mean error and squared error and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient were used as metrics to jointly evaluate 281 the goodness-of-fit of the model (the Supporting Information includes further results of the model 282 calibration and validation). 283 The detailed Jucar River system AQUATOOL model has been developed and perfected over time 284 by the Research Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering (IIAMA) of the Technical 285 University of Valencia (UPV) in a long fruitful collaboration with the Jucar River Basin Authority. 286 —14—  The model includes 8 inflows (our sub-basins), 7 reservoirs, 46 conduits, 17 consumptive demands, 287 3 hydro-power plants and 5 aquifers. 288 Current demands in the basin from CHJ (2009, 2014) include urban supply, agricultural demands, 289 industrial use, energy production uses and environmental flows. Future demands have been 290 estimated for the irrigated agriculture and urban uses, whereas the remaining uses have been 291 considered as constant, due to the low significance of these other demands. 292 Future urban demands were estimated using statistical projections of population (IVE 2012). Under 293 this statistical projection the population grows till 2050 and after that remains stable, as stated in the 294 UN World Population Prospects Database (UN 2011). This is consistent with the modeling 295 assumptions of the ENSEMBLES projections: all ENSEMBLES models are run under the A1B 296 forcing scenario assumption, that describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, global 297 population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, the rapid introduction of new and 298 more efficient technologies, and a balanced generation of energy from fossil and non-fossil fuels. 299 From the projected population, we obtain the total water demand assuming constant per capita 300 water use—a fair assumption, a little conservative though, because per capita use is decreasing a little 301 in the last decade but still in similar levels than in 1995 (INE 2016)—. 302 Agricultural uses within Jucar River basin are clearly separated spatial and typologically between the 303 inland Albacete region—“Mancha Oriental”—, and the flat coastal regions —“Ribera del Jucar”—. 304 Climatic data for base case scenario were obtained from the Spain02 project dataset (Herrera et al. 305 2012) over the 1960-2000 period for both regions, taking into account one representative cell for 306 each region (39N 2W to Mancha Oriental and 39.2N 0.4W for Ribera del Jucar). 307 We selected as representative crops for the agronomic modelling Mancha Oriental a variety of 308 seasonal crops grown in that region — wheat, barley, corn, grapes, onions and alfalfa— representing 309 —15—  more than 70% of total acreage in 2011 (JCRMO 2012), whereas in the Ribera del Jucar we only 310 modeled oranges and rice, by far the main crops in that region. From the climatic and crop acreage 311 data, and using the software CROPWAT explained above, we obtain the water requirements, also 312 assuming that the acreage for the crop mix within the two regions is constant through the different 313 scenarios. 314 The economic demand functions for the different uses in the Jucar River Basin were developed 315 based on previous economic evaluations for the Jucar River Basin District and adapted for this 316 study. For urban water use, we applied a simple “point-expansion” approach: a constant elasticity 317 curve derived from current water use and water price (1.06 €/m3) in the region and an estimate of 318 the price elasticity of demand (Jenkins et al., 2003). A demand price-elasticity value of -0.65 was used 319 in all the urban cases, based on the estimate from an econometric model based on panel data for the 320 Valencia region (Garcia Valiñas, 2002). From this point, the demand function was extrapolated 321 assuming that there is a maximum willingness to pay per cubic meter before switching to other water 322 source, assumed 6 €/m3 in most urban demands, and 7.8 €/m3 (a 30% increase) in tourist locations 323 because of the higher seasonality.  324  325 For agricultural demands we developed three different economic functions based on the main crops 326 produced: citrus and rice in the Ribera Baixa area, and cereals in the Mancha Oriental area. The 327 assumptions are adapted from the economic demand functions shown in MAGRAMA (2000) and 328 Sumpsi et al. (1998). Additional information on the development of those curves is provided in the 329 supplementary material. 330  For citrus, the water demand in some traditional irrigation sectors in the Jucar region follow 331 a function with three parts: a first inelastic part close to the current demand and price, an 332 PcQ —16—  exponential part where demands start to decrease, and a final elastic part until the price of 333 crop retirement. We assume a theoretical exponential function, P=a+b·Q+c·Qd, adjusted by 334 three points: current demand and current price (0.001 €/m3); a second point where price is 335 0.25 €/m3 and demand from the first point is quite inelastic; and a third point that is the 336 maximum willingness to pay that is 1 €/m3. 337  For rice, because the higher elasticity and lower profit, we assume a piece-linear function 338 with two stages: the first inelastic part defined by the current demand and current price 339 (0.005 €/m3) and a second lineal stage defined by this last point and the maximum 340 willingness to pay (0.03 €/m3). 341  For cereals we assume a concave function, P=a+b·Q+c·Q2+d/(Q+e), adjusted with the 342 maximum willingness to pay (0.6 €/m3), a point with 30% of maximum water demand with 343 price 0.03 €/m3 and the point with maximum demand and price null. 344 The economic functions for hydropower and nuclear water demands, derived from MMA (2004), 345 show a perfectly elastic demand with a price of 0.21 €/m3. A graphical description of all demand 346 functions is included in the Supporting Information. 347 Results 348 Best-fitting regional climate models from ENSEMBLES projections 349 Following the methodology developed above, the best-fitting ENSEMBLES RCMs selected for the 350 Jucar River Basin are: DMI-HIRHAM, GKSSCLM, KNMI RACMO2, MPI M REMO, UCLM-351 PROMES and OURANOS MRCC. Table 1 shows the results of the multiobjective analysis. 352 HERE: Table 1: Id index represents relative distance between historic dataset and base case, as a metric of 353 goodness of fit of the ENSEMBLES RCMs. Selected models, and their metrics, are underlined. 354 —17—  In the Supporting Information a comparison between historical data and the selected ENSEMBLES 355 RCMs outputs for the control period is shown. This study confirms that historical precipitation in 356 the Jucar Basin is overestimated by the RCMs, thus this concern can be significant when climate 357 change impacts on water resources are especially sensitive to precipitation.  358 Future climate scenarios  359 Results for the spatially and temporally aggregated monthly key statistics for future scenarios (Figure 360 4) show that the adjustment of the RCMs in the control scenario respect to the historic scenario is 361 much better in the temperature than in precipitation variables. It can be also seen that whereas the 362 temperature pattern through the different scenarios is a steady increase, the precipitation changes are 363 much more inconsistent. 364 HERE: Figure 4: Climatic variables variations projected by ENSEMBLES RCMs for all the scenarios. 365 Future inflow and demand scenarios 366 Results for monthly averaged runoff show a slight variation in the short-term scenario, with an 367 average reduction of 10 percent for the whole basin. The mid-term scenario has a significant 368 increase on winter runoff caused by higher precipitation, resulting in 5 percent more total annual 369 runoff. Finally, the long-term scenario shows a deep decrease on annual precipitation, decreasing 370 total runoff by 25 percent. 371 The statistical projection of water demands result in a 3.95% increase of urban demand for the 372 short-term scenario, an 8.30% increase for the mid-term scenario and an 8.46% increase for the 373 long-term scenario. Agricultural demands obtained from Cropwat for future scenarios show an 374 important increase in water requirement because of temperature increase (in the Supporting 375 Information the variation of water requirements for each crop is presented). 376 —18—  Figure 5 presents the average monthly demands and runoff for each scenario considered. 377 HERE: Figure 5: Monthly runoff and demand for the scenarios considered. 378 Climate change’s impacts on the system 379 Reliabilities (presented in Table 2) show a decrease from the base case to the long-term scenario 380 when impacts become very significant. Urban and industrial demands are less affected because they 381 have the highest priorities and the impacts on reliability are relatively acceptable, whereas the 382 agricultural demands show larger impacts, with 40% monthly reliability in some demands for the 383 long-term scenario. An exception to this trend is the “Zona Albacete” irrigation sector because it is 384 mostly irrigated with groundwater, and they will pump without accounting for reductions to surface 385 water (at the expenses of a greater groundwater overdrafting). 386 HERE: Table 2: Scarcity Costs (SC), Monthly Reliability (R) and Economic Loss Index (IEL) for each demands 387 and all the climate change scenarios and adaptation strategies simulated for the Jucar River Basin. 388  In the Supporting Information we present graphically the entire time series for delivery shortages, 389 reservoir storage and hydro-power flows. The trend is the same mentioned earlier, a progressive 390 decrease in the reliability of water supply, especially in long-term scenario as water availability is 391 further reduced while facing increasing demands. 392 The results of the hydro-economic model in Table 2 show that average scarcity cost increases 393 throughout the temporal scenarios, with a significant increase between the mid- and long-term 394 scenarios. Because of the different allocation priorities, there is a significant difference on the 395 economic impact across demands, where “Ac. Real y Antella” and “Canal J-T” are bearing most of 396 the total scarcity cost, while other demands are less affected. Figure 6, presents the results over the 397 historical time series (60 years) and the results of the perturbed historical time series for the climate 398 —19—  change scenarios, aggregating scarcity costs for all the demands in the system, showing a greater 399 impact of drought periods on the mid- and long-term scenarios. 400 HERE: Figure 6: Total annual scarcity cost for each scenario. 401 Assessment of the system performance 402 Table 2 shows the results of the indices evaluated, whereas Table 3 shows the results for the 403 Economic Loss Index for each demand in each scenario, showing how some demands are always more 404 damaged than others for all scenarios. 405 HERE Table 3: Results for system overall indices for each climate change scenario. 406 System performance is assessed using the indices, showing that the system is performing well in the 407 short- and mid-term scenarios. In the long-term, however, the system becomes very vulnerable, with 408 unreliable supplies and with excess of demand respect to the withdrawal. Additionally, the economic 409 loss index shows a lack of equity in water allocation, thus some demands are more affected than 410 others. Therefore, we define and assess potential adaptive options that could be taken to avoid the 411 economic costs of inaction for the long-term. 412 Definition and assessment of adaptive strategies 413 We select the following potential measures for evaluation for the long-term scenario:   414  Demand Management actions: 415 o Efficiency improvement in Ribera del Jucar: the irrigation efficiencies in traditional irrigation 416 areas of the lower Jucar River are under 0.5 (CHJ 2009), whereas irrigation in the Canal Jucar-417 Turia irrigation district has a efficiency of 0.75, and 0.85 for Mancha Oriental. The first 418 proposal on demand management is to to increase the efficiency of the traditional irrigation 419 demands up to 0.7 through irrigation modernization. 420 —20—   Decrease in Mancha Oriental demand: Most producers in Mancha Oriental are subsided by 421 the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the UE. Some experts declare that if the subsides 422 disappear, only 30% of current exploitations would be maintained. Hence, we examine 423 decreasing Mancha Oriental demands, maintaining only the exploitations that are willing to 424 pay more than 0.06 €/m3 (current average pumping cost), what implies a reduction in 75% 425 of the demand. 426  System management actions: 427 o Priorities: we examine assigning same priority to all irrigation areas to avoid the differences in 428 relative economic loss and improve system equity. 429 o Water Markets: differences in order of magnitude in the willingness to pay for water create the 430 ideal scenario to introduce water markets. Hence, we propose an adaptive management 431 strategy to include this management mechanism. 432 We run the water management model simulation and hydro-economic analysis for each strategy and 433 for each climate change scenario. Average annual scarcity cost in Table 2 show a significant 434 reduction in the average annual scarcity cost for the strategies considered. The efficiency 435 improvement on irrigations systems in La Ribera del Jucar leads to a reduction of the average annual 436 scarcity cost by 41 M€/year (45.11% reduction with respect to the long-term scenario), agricultural 437 demand reduction in Mancha Oriental has a decrease of 65 M€/year (71.90% reduction), 438 modification on water right priorities has a reduction of 3 M€/year (3.40%) and a redistribution of 439 system equity, and Water Markets implementation could reduce the average annual scarcity cost by 440 14 M€/year (a 14.47% reduction respect Long-Term scenario). 441 Figure 7 presents annual scarcity cost time series for the different adaptation scenarios. “Priorities” 442 strategy closely follows the same trend that the long-term scenario, while the other strategies 443 —21—  improves the overall economic results for the river basin system, presenting the decrease on Mancha 444 demand the larger economic saving, followed by the Efficiency strategy and finally, the 445 implementation of Water Markets. 446 HERE: Figure 7: Average Annual Scarcity Cost for each Adaptive Strategy. 447 Table 2 shows the scarcity cost for each demand changes with the different strategies employed. It is 448 important to note the improved values of the “Priorities” strategy as compared to the BAU long-449 term scenario, where the most damaged demands in the BAU long term scenario —Canal J-T, 450 Cuatro Pueblos, Cullera and Sueca— are better off. We can therefore conclude that this scenario 451 improves the equity of water allocation between the demands, on economic terms. 452 Discussion 453 This study clearly reveals the need of an interdisciplinary research in the analysis of global change 454 impacts and the assessment and selection of adaptation strategies, what requires developing an 455 integrated framework that moves across disciplines. Developing such integrated framework is 456 certainly a complex task that faces numerous theoretical and practical challenges (Girard et al. 2015b; 457 Kragt et al. 2013). In this context, modelling provides “a communicative tool and a valuable 458 methodology to merge the many structures and processes that are involved in interdisciplinary 459 research projects” (Kragt et al. 2013).  460 A chain of models are used for assessing the impact of climate and global change and for valuing the 461 contribution of adaptation measures to improve the system performance and the economic results. 462 First, we use a pseudo-distributed rainfall-runoff model (lumped per sub-basin) in order to translate 463 future P and T scenarios into new inflow time series. This information is then incorporated into a 464 simulation model of water resource system management, used to simulate the BAU scenarios and 465 the effect of different adaptive measures in a global change setting. Finally, a hydroeconomic 466 —22—  approach is used to translate those impacts into economic benefits and economic losses from the 467 changes in water deliveries to the different uses in the basin.   468 The calibration of the hydrological model requires unimpaired discharge time series in each sub-469 basin as described in the methods section. There is always uncertain in the process of restitution of 470 the recorded river discharge data into impaired flow. There is as well uncertainty on the potential 471 predictive capability of hydrological models for simulating climate change scenarios (Thirel et al., 472 2015; Fowler et al., 2016). 473 Future urban demands we have assumed that the per capita water use remains constant over time. 474 Although per capita use is decreasing a little in the last decade, we decided to use per constant per 475 capita use because some studies have related urban water use with temperature (Maidment et al. 476 1985), and increased temperatures in the climate change scenarios could induce a higher per capita 477 water use. 478 For future agricultural demands crop water requirements have been estimated based only on 479 changes in temperature and precipitation. CO2 effects or other possible dependencies have not been 480 accounted. It is expected that the fertilization effect of rising CO2 concentrations will offset the crop 481 yield losses (Long et al. 2006). Furthermore crop acreage, the crop mix and yields are expected to 482 change in the future, as crops will respond to new characteristics and farmers will adapt their 483 production functions to new circumstances. Therefore, the results have to be understood under 484 these assumptions, in relative terms respect to the BAU scenario: we are not trying to predict the 485 economic costs of the future, but rather to show that adaptive strategies to climate change for water 486 resources are a useful tool to reduce the potential economic costs of future conditions, showing 487 which adaptation tools are relatively more effective. 488 —23—  Another interesting point to discuss is about the current allocation of water rights among the uses. It 489 is possible that the future potential expansion of the irrigated demand were limited by the existing 490 distribution of water rights, opening potential litigations with other conflicting uses. The results 491 show that citrus trees will suffer a greater increase on water requirements than any other crop, so 492 irrigation districts with citrus would be more affected for this unaccounted legal issue. 493 In the results of the analysis of the adaptive strategies the last 2 strategies proposed are just changes 494 in management—by modifying priorities or enhancing water markets—that do not need 495 infrastructure investments or reductions in demand. This shows the potential to reduce effects of 496 climate change by improving water management. Other adaptive management strategies could also 497 be analyzed, such as interbasin water transfers, desalination, or improved reservoir and conjunctive 498 use management, being the method described valid for any other action. The integration of bottom-499 up and top-down approaches (Girard et al. 2015a) could also help to better define the future 500 scenarios and local adaptation strategies to be assessed. In any case, the main goal of that part was to 501 show the framework to analyze the strategies.  502 Conclusions 503 We described and applied a framework to evaluate the impacts of climate change on water resource 504 systems and the contribution of potential adaptation measures. The method considers the analysis of 505 the physical response of a basin by selecting the best-fitting RCMs and downscaling the key 506 hydrologic variables in order to obtain future inflows using a rainfall-runoff model. By projecting 507 future agricultural and urban demands, and using water management simulation models, we 508 obtained the system reliability for future scenarios. Assigning economic values to the water uses we 509 economically assess the shortages (scarcity cost). Finally we defined adaptive strategies and evaluate 510 —24—  the reliability of the system and the economic response to rank adaptive strategies to deal with global 511 change. 512 Results show that show the selected RCM models present a good fit to historic temperature but a 513 poorer fit for precipitation. The overall effects of climate change scenarios obtained using the water 514 management model show a progressive decrease in the reliability of supply through time, especially 515 in the long-term. 516 These expected shortages would increase average annual scarcity cost from roughly 1 M€ in the base 517 case, to 8 M€, 21 M€ and 91 M€ in short-, mid- and long-term scenarios, assuming no changes in the 518 infrastructure or operation of the system (business-as-usual scenarios). Some of the demands—519 mainly Canal Jucar-Turia and Acequia Real irrigation districts— will be the most economically 520 affected in the future. By using the Economic Loss Index we are able to assess the potential of different 521 adaptation options to increase the economic efficiency and equity of the system. 522 Through the application of different adaptation strategies the system can save from 3 to 65 M€/year 523 of the expected economic losses, depending on the adaptation actions adopted. Some strategies 524 analyzed involve neither demand reduction nor significant additional investments, but only new 525 policies to manage the system in a more efficient way for the new conditions. 526 Climate change is a global concern. Consequently many institutions are enforcing global efforts and 527 releasing reports and datasets to analyze the potential effects of climate change on natural and 528 human systems. But most water problems are local, and must be addressed locally by proper 529 strategies. Local analyses, as presented in this research, are needed to account for the local 530 adaptation responses. They require interdisciplinary approaches including analyses of climate 531 projections, hydrologic responses to a changing climate, demand projections, and water system 532 —25—  performance and economic assessments. Most of the partial studies should be done more accurately 533 but without losing the general insight achieved by the complete method presented. 534 Acknowledgements 535 The study has been partially supported by the IMPADAPT project (CGL2013-48424-C2-1-R and 536 CGL2013-48424-C2-2-R) of the National Research Plan (Plan Estatal I+D+I 2013-2016, funded by 537 the Spanish Ministry MINECO (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad) and European Feder 538 funds.
