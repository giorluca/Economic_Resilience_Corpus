Each chapter contains information of each island, which is the result of the significant work accomplished by 24 partner institutions of the H2020 Research and Inno-vation Action - SOCLIMPACT ¨Downscaling climate impacts and decarbonisation pathways in EU islands, and enhancing socio-economic and non-market evaluation of climate change, for 2050 and beyond¨. The decision to study islands lies on the particularities and the significant economic disadvantages of these territories with respect to the mainland, which hinder their progress towards the goals of sustainable development set by the European Union (EU). Besides, the coarse spatial resolution of many currently available projections of future changes in climatic parameters makes it difficult to derive valid statements for many of the smaller islands1. This lack of knowledge limits the successful implementation in islands, of the current efforts addressing decarbonisation strategies in Europe.At the same time, in the case of small islands, the social homogeneity and cohesion typical of insular communities, as well as their openness to explore new development tra-jectories, could also prove effective in inducing greater flex-ibility and decision-making efficiency, thus enhancing local coherence between natural resources protection, human cap-ital endowment and the institutional context, and favouring the implementation of environmental-oriented policies that reduce both the exposure to external economic fluctuations and the vulnerability to climatic disasters and climate change (Deidda, 2016). From this perspective, traditional reactive strategies, usually aiming to design adequate compensa-tions for islands’ structural disadvantages (i.e., subsidization of transport costs), need to be progressively accompanied by novel proactive and sustainable initiatives, including econom-ic diversification, technological and management innovation in traditional activities, and the development of new remu-nerative sectors, through mid- and long-term interventions that also prioritize the protection of the natural environment (Deidda,2016). Thus, by implementing “pilot policies” in these territories, EU islands can become the masterpieces of European strategies, generating in turn a real added value at EU level.Twelve European islands and outermost regions are anal-ysed: Azores (Ilha do Faial, Ilha de Sao Miguel e Ilha do Pico), Balearic Islands (Mallorca), Baltic Islands (Fehmarn), Canary Islands (Gran Canaria), Crete, Cyprus, Madeira, Malta, Sici-ly and French West Indies (Martinique and Guadeloupe). In Europe, the highest levels of endemism are reached in the Macaronesian islands (Canary islands, Madeira and Azores) with their unique blend of North Atlantic, African and Med-iterranean biogeographic influences and special vegetation types such as the humid evergreen laurel forest and the dry 1 Council of Europe – “Biodiversity and Climate Change”.Canary pine forests2. Climate change, thus, contributes to the progressing decline of their extraordinarily rich biodiversity.Among the sectors of relevance to insular economies that are exposed to climate change, this book focuses on four blue economy sectors: maritime transport, tourism, energy and aquaculture for its sector-specific analysis of climate change related impacts. This is done for many reasons:  i)  the impossibility to cover all the blue economy activities,  ii)  comparability potential of the four selected sectors between islands, iii)  the studied islands rely heavily on the tourism sector. At the same time, most of these regions rate among the top most popular destinations for non-EU residents. Climate change will cause important changes in the tourism vis-itation seasonality of these islands (Primo et al., 2018), iv)  seaports play a crucial role in the European economy positioning European islands as transportation hubs for the vast majority of goods transported around the world.  v)  these islands have vast amounts of renewable energy sources that may provide showcases for successful 100 % renewable energy supply. This is a challenge that can be addressed through storage or backup plants (which can be itself renewable energy plants), but also taking advantage of forecasting demand increases, and estimating increased complementarity of PV and wind energy for the very different consumers and prosumers characteristics, vi)  the contribution of aquaculture to fish production has grown from 25.7 % in 2000 to 46 % in 2018. However, in Europe, the share of aquaculture in fish production is only 17 % and the EU is the largest importing market (FAO 2020). Therefore, there is a growing interest to move large scale aquaculture operations further out into the sea, which has transformed the sector into an innovative research field, which requires advanced solutions spanning a wide range of technical, social and managerial competences (Buck and Langan, 2017). This goals is conditioned by the future climatic changes to which the marine environmet will be exposed. Environmental conditions in specific sites will not be appropriate for all candidate species, and the early assessment of the ranges of key variables (e.g., water temperature, salinity, nutrients, currents) is, therefore, essential for a sound enterprise planning.The introduction of direct economic impacts on these four blue economy sectors due to biophysical damages were then incorporated into the macroeconomic modelling frameworks to assess climate change consequences on GPD, employ-ment, consumption, investment and other 14 sectors. It aims to helping islands to fill-in some of the knowledge gaps that 2 Communication of the IUCN: “Climate Change and Biodiversity in the European Union Overseas Entities”.IntroductionXII DOWNSCALING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATION PATHWAYS FOR ISLANDS AND OUTERMOST REGIONSstill hinder the design of custom-tailored adaptation options and the emergence of fast growth opportunities in the marine-maritime context (see Figure 1).Next section presents an overview of the four blue economy sectors, their significance for the European islands, as well as existing evidence on their vulnerability to climate change impacts. The following section is dedicated to describe the methodology utilized for the study of climate change impacts on the 12 islands case studies. Chapters one to twelve pres-ents a comprehensive overview of the results by island’s case study. These chapters also include a description of the present climate and risks in each island, and the sectoral and macroeconomic projections for the 12 islands. Current limits and obtacles in the islands, and recommendations for the enhancement of resilent capacities are provided as part of each island case study. The last two sections conclude and list the references.Figure 1. A sector and island approach.Overview of the Blue Economy Sectors in the European IslandsMaritime TransportMaritime transport is defined as the carriage of goods and passengers by sea-going vessels, on voyages undertaken wholly or partly at sea. It is often considered as the back-bone of the world economy, with 80 % of the global trade volume passing through ports (Asariotis & Benamara, 2012). For islands, the transport of goods and passengers by ship is even more essential. At the same time, maritime transport contributes to climate change through its carbon emissions which are found to be near 3 % of the global CO2 equiva-lent emissions (Smith et al., 2015). Compared to land and air transport, it is the (economically and ecologically) most effective way of distributing goods globally.A changing climate will challenge maritime transport to adapt to future risks and lower its emissions. The maritime transport is one of the key EU blue economy sectors, since Europe is amongst the leading maritime centers in the world with 329 key seaports along its coastline, and controlling around one-third of the world’s merchant fleet1. Ports are vital gateways, linking European transport corridors to the rest of the world. As 75 % of European external trade tran-sits through EU ports, the shipping sector plays a major role in connecting the European market with its trade part-ners. According to the European Union’s Statistical Office (EUROSTAT) and other online resources, for Mediterranean countries including Cyprus, Greece and Malta there is a sig-nificant direct contribution (3-10 %) of the maritime transport sector to the total Gross Value Added (GVA). The EU mari-time sector has a multiplier effect of 2.6. Hence, crudely speaking, for every 1 euro spent in this industry, another 2.6 euros are created. In addition, there is a very strong linkage with other vital economic sectors such as services, tourism, energy, supply of goods, etc. For every €1 million the EU shipping industry contributes to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) itself, it creates a further €1.6 million elsewhere in the European economy. IntroductionDOWNSCALING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATION PATHWAYS FOR ISLANDS AND OUTERMOST REGIONS XIIIAccording to EUROSTAT data, the sector directly employs nearly 250,000 persons (or 0.1 % of the EU-27 workforce). About 20 % of the total employment in the EU shipping indus-try are shore-based, while the rest 80 % is based at sea. Besides the transport of goods within the EU territories and overseas, the maritime sector is also important for the trans-portation of passengers and the connection between differ-ent countries or between remote islands and the mainland. The whole range of potential impacts of climate change on ports operations and through put is still under study and it remains a high degree of uncertainty about it2. Various cli-mate change stressors can affect both harbour infrastructure and ships on-route. For example, ports are vulnerable nodes of maritime transport as they are strongly affected by rising sea-levels, which in turn affect port facilities and increase the risk of flooding. Sea-level rise has accelerated in the last century and will rise by 0.43 to 0.84 m until 2100, depend-ing on the emission scenario (Pörtner et al., 2019). Due to ocean dynamics and the Earth’s gravity field, there will also be regional differences in sea-level rise in the order of 0.1 m (Asariotis & Benamara, 2012). The causes of sea-level rise are the thermal expansion of water and the melting of glaciers due to the increase in global mean temperature (Ver-meer & Rahmstorf, 2009). Maritime transport can also be affected by climate change through the increase in the intensity of extreme weather events including tropical-like cyclones. According to climate projections, tropical cyclones are not expected to change sig-nificantly in frequency but in intensity due to rising sea-surface temperatures (Pörtner et al., 2019). The resulting extreme winds and waves can harm ships, but also cause damage and flooding of ports, especially in combination with sea-level rise (Hanson & Nicholls, 2012). Besides the risks for maritime transport due to climate change, a reduction of sea ice extent in the Arctic offers the opportunity to open up a new shipping route, which, for example, shortens the sea route between Europe and East Asia by about 50 % (Hong, 2012).Climate hazards such as sea-level rise or extreme weather events of increased intensity (e.g., windstorms, floods) can impose direct biophysical impacts. These can include floods on ports, damage to storage capacity and ports’ infrastruc-ture or equipment, or increase the number of operational stops. Consequently, socio-economic impacts will likely be introduced. Such impacts can include the increased users’ risk perception leading to lower rates of moorings and turn-over, increased costs of maintenance in nautical installa-tions and equipment, increased costs for new investment and insurance, carbon tax effects on fossil fuel prices, less turn-over from maritime transport activities and disruption costs.Estimating the costs and effectiveness of adaptation mea-sures depends on the location of the port and is often diffi-cult to assess. In most cases, however, the most effective adaption measure would be to improve the flood resistance of transport infrastructure and increase the height of the ports (Yang et al., 2018). Most of these impacts and their economic value will be discussed in the next chapters.TourismCoastal and maritime tourism is the largest maritime activity in Europe and employs almost 3.2 million people, generating a total of €183 billion in gross value added. It represents over one third of the maritime economy. In islands, tourism is usually the main economic activity, not only in Europe but also around the world (Arabadzhyan et al., 2020). According to the 5th assessment report of the IPCC3, climate change is expected to “reshape” the tourism industry and will impact the geographical and seasonal distribution of tou-rists all over Europe (Scott et al., 2008). In this research, it is assumed that the whole tourism activity of the islands is assigned to the coastal and maritime tourism sector (here-after referred as “tourism”). It is fully justified because the vast majority of the tourist activities in islands are based on the infrastructures and the natural attractions that are distribu ted throughout the coastal and littoral areas, and all tourists visiting inland areas enjoy their coastal environments during the visit (going to beaches, consuming coastal-based food and/or undertaking outdoor activities). It is relatively easy to demonstrate that in almost all cases, the iconogra-phy and tourism image of the islands are related to the sea and the coastal resources (Arabadzhyan et al., 2020), and that the main tourist motivations pull factors to visit islands rely on sea-based assets.Thus, tourism as a demand-side phenomenon refers to the activities of visitors and their role in the acquisition of goods and services, usually related to coastal resources. It can also be viewed from the supply side, and tourism will then be understood as the set of productive activities catered main-ly to visitors during their stay. Changes in the multiplicity of variables that constitute the climate of the islands are the consequence of global warming, in its turn powered by human-induced emissions of GHG. These changes ha ppen in each island depending of the complex interactions between air masses speed, temperature, and humidity; circula-tion, temperature and acidity of the oceans; and the location, topography and bathymetry, vegetal covered and types of soil characterizing the islands. In addition, tourism long-term sustainability depends on the preservation and enhancement of its environment. All biophysical changes are directly and indirectly affecting tourism, especially in destinations where nature is a key attractor for tourists. Alteration of natural resources through changes in average conditions (water temperature and qual-ity, biodiversity, etc.) or occurrence of extreme events (for-est fires, droughts) may affect tourist practices in rural and coastal environment such as walking, riding, hiking, swim-ming. These impacts can damage ecosystems, biodiversity and landscapes, as well as infrastructure and human wellbe-ing. They can also increase difficulties in risk management of these areas in order to provide a safe environment and affect more broadly the tourism businesses in long-term when alteration is sustained (marketing, investments in those locations).IntroductionXIV DOWNSCALING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATION PATHWAYS FOR ISLANDS AND OUTERMOST REGIONSEnergyThere are more than 2,200 inhabited islands in the EU. Late-ly, they have come into the focus of the EU, which addresses energy questions as part of the ‘Clean energy for all Euro-peans’ package. The Clean energy for EU islands initiative provides a long-term framework to help islands generate their own sustainable, low-cost energy. This is particularly interest-ing, because many islands have vast amounts of renewable energy sources but rely on fossil fuel imports yet. These are relevant challenges regarding the energy transition in the EU, whose aim of net zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 should determine the future energy plans of the islands. Islands could provide showcases for successful 100 % renew-able energy supply.However, how can the islands’ energy supply be robust against climate change? And how will energy demand change in a world with a changing climate? In brief, which are the risks that climate change poses to the respective energy systems on European islands?The National Hydropower Association (NHA) defines marine energy as electricity generation from marine kinetic ener-gy, such as waves, tidal and ocean currents. Pisacane et al. (2018) add other marine energy sources like ocean thermal energy conversion (exploiting temperature di ffer-ences between deep and surface ocean waters) and salinity gradient energy (harnessing the energy potential of differences in salt concentration in ocean and river waters). All these technologies are still in a development phase, and even if they reach the commercial phase in the future, it is not likely that they will generate a large share of the power. Therefore, the analysis of this book refers to the main renewable energy sources (RES), wind ener-gy and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, which are currently, and very likely in future, the backbone of the deployment of renewable energies, due to their technological maturity and low cost. Not only onshore but also offshore wind energy is taken into account. The latter is a specific marine energy source which has distinct advantages like much higher productivi-ty and less time variability than onshore wind energy, and does not require land space which is limited and costly in the islands. There are relevant obstacles for its deployment, like the deep bathymetry surrounding most of the islands, and the lower wind speeds over the Mediterranean in compar-ison to areas like the North Sea where offshore wind energy is being deployed rapidly. But recent technological advances in floating supports for the wind towers and cost reductions are opening this possibility, so that currently there are two commercial-scale projects respectively for Gran Canaria and Sicily.Additionally, we consider also offshore PV energy. Despite some disadvantages that have to be overcome (corrosion problems due to salty water or the impact of waves), this application is receiving growing interest, as it offers an alter-native option for renewable energy development in coun-tries and islands with limited space for the installation of solar panels, and can show increased performance due to the cooling effect of water and wind on PV cells (Golrood-bary and Sark, 2020). The installation of offshore floating PV panels has been already tested for one of the islands analysed (Malta; Grech et al., 2016), and one offshore PV farm is already operating near the coast of the Netherlands (Gutiérez et al., 2020), an area characterised by high waves. Offshore floating photovoltaics is being considered in future strategies and plans, like the recently published Roadmap for the Offshore Renewable Energy Strategy of the Europe-an Comission or the report of Monitor Deloitte and Endesa (2020) proposing a plan for the accelerated decarbonization of Canary and Balearic Islands.Most RES depend on the climate, and therefore, climate change can have an impact of the resource amount. Addi-tionally, wind and solar PV energy are not dispatchable, and its variability represents a challenge for its integration in the power system. This is a challenge that can be addressed through storage or backup plants (which can be itself renew-able energy plants), through demand management, but also taking advantage of complementarity of PV and wind energy and its very different variable characteristics.This approach is gaining attention from stakeholders in the islands, as demonstrated by the report by Monitor Deloitte and Endesa (2020), in which one of the key recommenda-tions for achieving an accelerated zero carbon target in Bale-aric and Canary Islands by 2040 is the combination of solar PV and wind energy, with clearly higher shares of PV than of wind energy. Such a mix would reduce strongly the need for storage, due to the stability of solar PV production.There are also challenges for the demand and transmission components of the energy systems of the islands due to climate change: changes in temperature leading to changing energy demand, changes in precipitation and evaporation creating risks for desalination, and extreme weather events (particularly extreme winds) challenging the distribution of the infrastructure. Next chapters will be dedicated to analyse the effects of climate change on the demand and supply sides of the energy system. AquacultureIn recent decades, the amount of farmed fish consumed by the world’s human population has been constantly growing, from 14 million tonnes per year in the 80s and early 90s to over 82 million tonnes in 2018 (FAO 2020). The contribution of aquaculture to fish production has grown from 25.7 % in 2000 to 46 % in 2018. However, in Europe, the share of aquaculture in fish production is only 17 % and the EU is the largest importing market (FAO 2020). When looking at finfish production in 2018, only 13.44 % was produced in marine and coastal environments, while inland aquaculture, mostly freshwater, accounted for the highest contribution to farmed fish production (FAO 2020).IntroductionDOWNSCALING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATION PATHWAYS FOR ISLANDS AND OUTERMOST REGIONS XVThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) highlighted that there is a growing need to transfer coastal aquaculture production systems further offshore. From the global perspective, this is due to the expected increase in human population and to the increasing problem of wild-caught seafood overfishing, as well as to the compe-tition for access to land, clean water and sea space that can limit the availability of fish and fishery products for human consumption from inshore farms. As a matter of fact, due to the divergent spatial, economic and political interests among the many coastal stakeholders competing for marine space (e.g., to be granted access to fishing grounds, shi-pping routes, marine environment protection, touristic deve-lopment of coastal areas, seabed extraction rights, marine renewables deployment opportunities), further development of aquaculture can only be achieved after accurate combined mapping of the biological production potential and of the constraints deriving from existing ocean uses and limita-tions (Oyinlola et al., 2018), highlighting the crucial role that economic planning and governance play in shaping growth trajectories by harmonizing economic, environmental and social objectives.In this context, offshore aquaculture represents a novel per-spective as to governance issues, by shifting the competi-tion for marine space from the historically well-rooted social networks with traditional use patterns to a limited number of large, often international operating companies, with limited social networks and engagement with each other. Offshore aquaculture may also reduce the environmental impacts of nutrient release in correspondence of farms, and allow expan- sion of the operations to enable large-scale growth also in the connected sectors, provided suitable farming practices are adopted (Abhinav et al., 2020). For these reasons, the growing interest to move large scale aquaculture operations further out into the sea has transformed the sector into an innovative research field, which requires advanced solutions spanning a wide range of technical, social and managerial competences (Buck and Langan, 2017). “Offshore” aquaculture depends on a variety of factors, both topographical (e.g., distance from shore and depth) and operational (e.g., accessibility of farms). A simplified definition was proposed by Drumm (2010), who identified it as being exposed to wind and wave action, and requiring equipment and servicing ves-sels to survive and operate in severe sea conditions, while the distance from a shore base or a harbour is not always a distinctive factor. However, such classification criteria can only give a prelim-inary idea of the farming conditions, and specific individual situations should always be considered as to both prevail-ing local environmental conditions at the sites and admin-istrative constraints. As regards this last aspect, offshore locations might in fact fall within internal waters in some countries with extensive archipelagos and in international waters for other countries.The possibility of moving farms farther offshore clearly relies on: a) the recent design of more robust culture technologies based on substantial advances in numerical and physical modelling of cages and longlines and of their optimal arrangement (Drimer, 2019), b) innovative strategies with respect to those adopted for inshore farming, such as Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquacul-ture6 (IMTA) systems (Buck et al., 2018), and c) the devel-opment of novel culture systems that can be submerged to avoid the winds and waves characteristic of offshore areas. A number of such technologies now exist at the commercial stage of development, consisting of either rigid or tensile structures, that remain at the surface in normal conditions but can be submerged upon early warning, before a storm reaches the farm site (Sturrock et al., 2008). Submersible systems offer the additional advantages of avoiding harm-ful oxygen-depleting algal blooms and of enabling the re-po-sitioning of cages in correspondence of optimal currents and/or temperatures to improve fish farming conditions, optimize growth and avoid thermal stress, at the same time reducing the exposure to parasites and anthropogenic pollution (Buck and Langan, 2017). In addition, intelligent monitoring and control technologies for the optimization of operations at sea are constantly being developed, to increase yield and achieve high efficiency and safety of farming (Wei et al., 2020).Local communities would naturally act as nodes for farm operation and maintenance, thus benefiting from the poten-tial creation of additional jobs, income protection through diversification, and access to new markets, with a conse-quent increase in the social acceptance of offshore develop-ment (Buck et al., 2018). Nevertheless, local and regional planning is crucial to correctly assess how such develop-ments are liable to affect the interlinked social and natural systems, and thus, to avoid negative impacts.Climate change adaptation represents an additional con-straint on the future status and development of this sec-tor, which will possibly imply additional costs for existing enterprises and determine the feasibility or the necessity of moving the activities in more suitable environmental con-ditions. A thorough assessment should obviously rely on detailed geographic information systems, detailed monitor-ing and mapping of the marine environment and high-resolu-tion circulation models covering a wide range of scales and expanding from the open sea to the coast, as well as on spatial planning tools to support the ecosystem approach to aquaculture. That is to say, a complete and costly set of management tools should be developed and tuned to spe-cific situations and needs, in order to support aquaculture planning at local levels (Macias et al., 2019).In this book, an overall open-sea assessment of the expected climate change impact on aquaculture is conducted, setting a framework for further and more detailed analyses and eas-ing the early elicitation of the trade-offs this sector is liable to deal with. It provides a first evaluation of their degree of exposure and vulnerability, and a preliminary assessment of the local impacts, either negative or positive, of climate change on this industry.IntroductionXVI DOWNSCALING CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS, SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATION PATHWAYS FOR ISLANDS AND OUTERMOST REGIONSThe Mediterranean BasinFollowing the global trend, in the Mediterranean countries, aquaculture has grown to become a crucial contributor to regional fish production, exploiting a wide variety of envi-ronments and farming technologies. Such development ben-efited from the substantial improvements in floating cage technology, which allowed aquaculture to progressively move further into the open sea (FAO, 2017), thus minimizing con-flicts of use in an overexploited maritime space, and better meeting environmental constraints.This positive trend is expected to consolidate in future years as a result of aquaculture development plans in the region, posing severe constraints on the management of maritime space and demanding accurate planning in order to mitigate the increasing pressure on coastal zones. Strategies must be designed to avoid that the availability of suitable are
