Abstract 
The photoautotrophic production of excreted biofuels from genetically engineered 
cyanobacteria and microalgae represents a new and promising alternative to conventional 
algal fuel technologies. N-butanol is a particularly promising fuel product, as it can be directly 
used in petroleum engines, and has been successfully expressed in species of 
Synechococcus elongates 7942 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. However, the high energy 
requirements of recovering butanol from dilute mixtures can easily outweigh the energy 
content of the fuel and must be carefully assessed and optimized. Consequently, the recovery 
of butanol was modelled using four of the most promising butanol separation technologies 
(distillation, gas stripping, pervaporation and ionic liquid extraction) to calculate the minimum 
butanol culture concentrations required to render the process energy-positive. With a break-
even concentration of only 3.7 g L-1, ionic liquid extraction proved much more efficient than 
the distillation base-case scenario (9.3 g L-1), whilst neither pervaporation (10.3 g L-1) nor gas 
stripping (16.9 g L-1) could compete on an energy basis with distillation. Despite this, due to 
the high costs of the ionic liquid solvent, the lowest capital costs are obtained for distillation 
2 
 
(pilot plant scale, butanol culture concentrations of 10 g L-1), whilst pervaporation carries the 
lowest utility costs, as a result of its low electrical energy demand. Although currently achieved 
maximum n-butanol culture concentrations are significantly below the calculated break-even 
values for all four technologies, the present work provides an important threshold for future 
strain development. Moreover, the recovery of side-products from purged biomass could help 
to reduce the costs associated with biofuel production.

1 Introduction 
Driven by concerns about climate change and energy security, the last two decades have 
seen an explosion in the global production of biofuels to substitute conventional, petroleum-
based transportation fuels. Amongst these, bioethanol is by far the most widely used biofuel, 
as it can be easily produced from the fermentation of a wide range of biomass resources. 
Nevertheless, as a result of its high oxygen content, high hygroscopicity and low carbon chain 
length, the fuel properties of ethanol are far from ideal[1], limiting maximum blend 
concentrations in conventional petroleum combustion engines to 10 vol% [2][3]. 
Consequently, research interest has increasingly shifted to longer chain alcohols,  particularly 
n-butanol, which can be produced via the ABE (Acetone Butanol Ethanol) fermentation 
process, using Clostridium acetobutylicum [4]. Unlike ethanol, butanol is not hydrogroscopic, 
is less corrosive and has a higher energy content of 29.2 MJ L-1, compared to 21.2 MJ L-1, 
which means it can be used either in pure or blended form, without engine modification [1]. 
Since the early 2000s, the process has been applied to a wide range of feedstocks, including 
sugars and starches, cellulose and even macro- and microalgae [5]. However, it is limited by 
relatively low butanol yields, the use of land-based biomass and low final butanol 
concentrations, resulting in high recovery costs [6].

An alternative production pathway is the direct conversion of CO2 into butanol within 
genetically engineered, autotrophic microorganisms, followed by excretion into the growth 
medium. This allows the recovery of butanol from the culture, whilst recycling the biomass 
back into the photobioreactor for further product expression and minimises the nutrient 
requirements for biomass growth. Autotrophic production of n-butanol by the cyanobacterium 
Synechococcus elongates 7942 was first demonstrated in 2011, after transferring a modified 
CoA-dependent 1–butanol production pathway into the cyanobacterium [7]. During cultivation 
in anoxic conditions, butanol accumulation reached up to 14.5 mg L-1 after seven days of 
culture, however the presence of oxygen (a by-product of biomass growth) was found to exert 
a strong inhibitory effect. Further manipulations of this strain by the same group helped to 
increase 1-butanol titres to 29.9 mg L-1 [8] and 317 mg L-1 [9], whilst substituting the oxygen 
sensitive CoA-acylating butyraldehyde dehydrogenase with an alternative, oxygen tolerant 
CoA-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase. N-butanol expression has also been demonstrated 
in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, achieving titres of up to 100 mg L-1 [10]. 
However, it was found that maximum butanol titres within the investigated host organisms are 
limited by significant inhibition of cell growth at butanol concentrations of 750 mg L-1 and above 
[9][11]. To address this limitation, a number of studies have been conducted to identify genes 
responsible for regulating butanol tolerance in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, to aid the 
development of strains with enhanced butanol tolerance [12][13]. Butanol tolerance can also 
be increased through long-term experimental evolution processes, as demonstrated by Wang 
et al. [14], who achieved a 150 % increase of the butanol tolerance in Synechocystis sp. PCC 
6803 (0.2 vol% to 0.5 vol%) after 94 passages over a 395 day period.  
In all cases, it is obvious that further improvements of the butanol productivity are required, 
before this technology becomes commercially feasible. Particularly the high energy 
requirements of recovering butanol from dilute mixtures is a major concern and can easily 
outweigh the energy content of the final product, rendering the biofuel production process 
energy negative. Luyben, for example, predicted a combined heating and cooling duty of 
4 
 
9.1 MJ kg-1 for the recovery of butanol from a 2 mol% mixture (~ 77.5 g L-1) using a  
conventional distillation/decanter process, which represents a significant proportion of the 
butanol energy content of 36.1 MJ kg-1 [15]. Slightly more favourable results were obtained by 
Vane and Alvarez, who managed to reduce the break-even concentrations from approximately 
8.5 L-1 to 5 g L-1 by implementing heat integration between the in- and outlet streams, however 
their model considered the heating requirements only [16].  
A number of separation processes, including gas stripping, pervaporation, adsorption and 
liquid-liquid extraction, have been proposed as potential low-energy alternatives to distillation 
and were tested for the recovery of butanol from ABE fermentation mixtures [17]. In-situ 
separation resulted in increased butanol productivity, glucose conversion and butanol 
concentration in broth [18]. Despite such enhancement, the system energy requirements have 
rarely been quantified, let alone compared against one another. Nonetheless, a good 
understanding of the total system energy requirements is essential to identify the best overall 
system configuration, and to determine the minimum butanol production targets that need to 
be met before autotrophic n-butanol production can become commercially feasible. 
In the present work, the autotrophic production and recovery of biobutanol was modelled on 
Aspen Plus using four of the most promising butanol separation technologies: distillation, gas 
stripping, pervaporation and ionic liquid extraction (ILE). Each system was carefully optimised 
and energy integration was performed over a range of butanol concentrations (1 to 10 g L-1), 
in order to identify the best configuration and operating conditions for each separation process. 
This allowed the estimation of the break-even butanol concentrations at which the recovery 
energy equals the fuel energy content, allowing like-for-like comparison of all four separation 
processes and the establishing of a minimum butanol target value. Moreover, the economic 
potential was evaluated by determining the capital and operating costs of a pilot plant facility 
(100 kg h-1) for a n-butanol culture concentration of 10 g L-1. It is clear that a single study 
cannot cover all technology options, and the current study has been restricted to four easily 
implementable technologies, most relevant to the current project. Nonetheless, the current 
5 
 
study provides a rigorous methodology to compare and assess different separation processes, 
offering a benchmark for future studies on alternative separation processes, such as 
adsorption. 
2 Methodology 
2.1 Model Overview 
The autotrophic production and recovery of n-butanol via the four selected separation 
processes (distillation, gas stripping, pervaporation and ILE) was modelled in Aspen Plus V9 
using the NRTL equation of state. For completeness, the algal cultivation stage was modelled 
using an equation-oriented model using Aspen Custom Modeller (ACM) based on published 
literature data, but has little impact on the downstream physical separation process. Therefore, 
Aspen was deemed a suitable tool to determine the energy requirements and cost estimates 
for the different physical separation processes. Each model consists of three stages (Figure 
1): (1) a cultivation stage, containing the photobioreactor (PBR), where CO2 and water are 
converted into n-butanol, oxygen and biomass; (2) a butanol recovery stage, where butanol is 
removed from the culture using the selected separation technology, and (3) a polishing stage, 
where the recovered product is purified via phase separation and distillation to produce pure 
butanol. Except for minor variations to account for differences in the set-up of recycle streams 
and the butanol purity at the outlet of the recovery stage, all four models employ the same set-
up for the cultivation and polishing stages. Their main difference is therefore the choice of 
separation technology for the recovery of butanol from the culture and the removal of excess 
water to obtain a sufficiently concentrated butanol stream.  
To enable like-for-like comparison of the four butanol recovery processes, the n-butanol 
production rate of each system was controlled at 1 kg h-1 by adjusting the PBR volume. The 
butanol concentration at the PBR outlet was set to values ranging from 1 g L-1 to 10 g L-1 by 
varying the dilution rate through the PBR. To account for pressure drop, all liquid and stripping 
6 
 
gas recycle streams were passed through pumps or compressors to increase their pressure 
by 1 bar.  
2.2 Butanol production 
To model the complex growth kinetics of a butanol-producing cyanoabacteria, a custom model 
was developed for the PBR, based on a combined form of the Monod model, representing 
biomass growth, and the Logistic model, representing cyanobacteria decay (Equation 1) [19]. 
(The first term on the right hand side of the equation represents biomass growth, whereas the 
second term represents biomass decay.)

where 𝑋 is biomass concentration (g L-1), 𝜇 is biomass specific growth rate (h-1), 𝑋max is 
maximum biomass concentration under nutrient-sufficient conditions (g L-1), and 𝜇𝑑 is biomass 
specific decay rate (L g-1 h-1). 
By assuming that both CO2 and nutrients are supplied in excess, biomass growth becomes a 
function of incident light and temperature only (Equation 2a). Their effects were modelled 
using the Aiba model (Equation 2b) and an Arrhenius type rate equation (Equation 2c), 
respectively, which have been previously found to be suitable models for this purpose [19]. 
Unlike biomass growth, biomass decay is a function of temperature only and therefore the 
biomass decay rate can be equated to the temperature term only: 
𝜇 = 𝜇𝑚 ∙ 𝑘(𝐼) ∙ 𝑘(𝑇)                                                                                                                                           (2𝑎)

culture temperature (K), Ta and Tb are reference temperatures for algae growth and death, 
respectively, (K), and 𝑅 is the gas constant (8.315 J mol-1 K-1). 
To determine the parameters kS, ki, Aa, Ea, Ad and Ed, the models were fitted to published 
growth data for the cyanobacteria Synechocysystis PCC 6803 [20], at a reference temperature 
of 303 K, using a non-linear least-squares solver in Matlab (Model parameters provided in 
supplementary information). Substituting equations 2a, b, c and d into Equation 1 yields the 
overall differential equation describing biomass concentration (Equation 3).

In the absence of sufficient data for photoautotrophic butanol production, the ratio of butanol 
production to biomass growth was fixed at 0.975. As the current model does not account for 
nutrient consumption (which is expected to be small for photocatalytic production), the 
relationship between butanol productivity and growth has a minor effect on the model results.  
2.3 Butanol recovery  
The recovery of n-butanol from the PBR outlet stream was modelled using the four selected 
separation processes. For each process, the butanol-depleted medium stream is recycled to 
the inlet of the PBR, whereas the butanol rich product is fed to the final polishing stage. Prior 
to the recovery stage, the culture is passed through a low energy filtration stage (0.4 – 
0.88 kW h m-3)[21], to retain the algal cells within the PBR and prevent them from being 
damaged in the recovery process, with an assumed energy penalty of 0.5 kW h m-3(inlet flow). 
2.3.1 Distillation 
Representing the most commonly used technique for the separation of alcohols, distillation 
was selected as the base case scenario. In this model, a single stage distillation column was 
8 
 
employed to raise the butanol concentration into the immiscible phase region, allowing further 
purification in the polishing stage (Figure 1). 
In addition to butanol and the aqueous growth medium, the recovery system inlet contains a 
number of dissolved reaction gases, which cannot be condensed following distillation. The 
distillation unit was therefore modelled using the RadFrac column option of Aspen, allowing 
the recovery of both gaseous and liquid streams from the condenser. To reduce the column 
loading, the distillation inlet is first pre-heated using H-1, allowing the removal and recycling 
of non-condensable gases in flash drum V-1. The organic phase is subsequently sent to the 
polishing stage, whilst the aqueous phase is cooled and returned back to the PBR.  
 
Figure 1: Schematic of system set-up for butanol recovery by distillation 
2.3.2 Gas stripping 
The gas stripping system model employs the stripping gas nitrogen to reduce the vapour 
pressure of n-butanol in the gas phase, thereby lowering the temperature required for 
evaporation. In order to obtain a sufficiently high butanol concentration at the polishing stage 
inlet, a minimum of two stripping stages are required (Figure 2). In each stage, the process 
stream is mixed with the stripping gas and heated to the required stripping temperature in 
exchangers H-1 and H-2. Subsequently, the combined stream is fed to a flash drum (S-1/S-2)

to recover a butanol-rich vapour stream and allow the recycling of the butanol-depleted 
aqueous phase to the previous processing stage. Butanol is re-condensed in coolers C-1 and 
C-2, and recovered in flash drums V-1 and V-2. Whilst the second-stage product is passed to 
the polishing stage, the stripping gas streams are recycled to the stage inlets via compressors 
Comp-1 and Comp-2. 
 
Figure 2: Schematic of system set-up for butanol recovery by gas stripping 
2.3.3 Pervaporation 
Similarly to gas stripping, the pervaporation system employs two separation stages to achieve 
the required butanol concentration at the polishing stage inlet (Figure 3). Preheaters (H-1 and 
H-2) at the stage inlets raise the stream temperatures to the specified pervaporation 
conditions. Subsequently, the low-pressure permeate streams are passed through coolers C-
1 and C-2 to condense recovered butanol and water, before the non-condensables gases are 
pumped through compressors Comp-1 and Comp-2 to maintain the required vacuum at the 
pervaporator outlet. The aqueous retentate streams are recycled to the previous stage inlet 
via transfer pumps P-3 and P-4.

Figure 3: Schematic of system set-up for butanol recovery by pervaporation 
To model the pervaporation units themselves, a custom unit operation was developed in 
Aspen Custom modeller, based on the following assumptions [22]: 
1. Perfect mixing at either side of the membrane ensures constant compositions within 
the permeate and retentate streams 
2. The pervaporation of vapours across the membrane represent the rate controlling step 
3. The permeability of each component in the mixture is equal to that of the pure 
component 
4. The pressure drop across the feed and permeate streams is negligible 
5. Diffusion along the flowpath is negligible 
Consequently, the membrane flux of each component can be described by Equation 4:

thickness, pi,f is the partial pressure of component i in the retentate, and pi,p is the partial 
pressure of component i in the permeate. 
The partial pressure of each component in the retentate can be estimated from the product of 
its mol fraction, xi, activity coefficient, γi, and saturation pressure, pisat, at a given pervaporation 
temperature (Equation 5a), whereas the partial pressure in the permeate is the product of the 
permeate pressure, pp, and its vapour mol fraction, yi (Equation 5b). The mol fractions of each 
component in the permeate, retentate and feed (xi) can be related using the permeate to feed 
flow ratio, defined as the stagecut, φ (Equation 5c). In addition, for mass balance purposes, 
the individual component mass fractions in each phase must sum to unity (Equations 5d and 
e).

Permeability values for all system components were obtained from the literature for a 
commercial PERVAP 4060 membrane (Table 1). After specifying values for stagecut, 
pervaporation temperature and permeate pressure, the model is thus able to predict retentate 
and permeate stream compositions and the required membrane area.

The pervaporator heat duty is calculated using an energy balance across the system and 
importing the enthalpy values for each stream. To include the pervaporator heat duties when 
running the Aspen energy analyser, their values were duplicated in separate heat exchangers 
placed on the flowsheet.  
2.3.4 Ionic liquid extraction 
The ionic liquid extraction model consists of two extraction stages, each containing 10-stage 
liquid-liquid extraction units (E-1 andE-2, Figure 4). Both units are operated at cultivation 
temperature and the ionic liquid outlet streams are subsequently heated in H-1 and H-2 to 
flash off the recovered butanol and water. The product streams are condensed in coolers C-
1A and C-2A, whereas the regenerated ionic liquid is recycled to the stage inlet, via coolers 
C-1B and C-2B.  
The Aspen Plus database does not contain property data for ionic liquids, and consequently, 
these were set up manually using literature values for the binary interaction parameters for 1-
13 
 
hexyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([hmim][PF6]) [25]. The corresponding ideal 
heat capacity parameters were estimated with the Aspen estimation tool using heat capacity 
values in the 293.15 K to 343.15 K range [26]. To reflect the negligible ionic liquid vapour 
pressure, the Antoine’s coefficients were estimated from a nominal vapour pressure value of 
1 Pa at 100 °C, with a molar enthalpy of vaporization of 1000 cal/mol. The required input 
values for the critical pressure and temperature, Pitzer acentric factor (OMEGA), liquid molar 
volume were chosen arbitrarily, as they have no bearing on the model results.

2.4 Polishing system 
At molar concentrations of 24.8 %, n-butanol forms an azeotrope with water, preventing the 
production of pure butanol using single-stage distillation. Similarly, none of the other three 
separation techniques are capable of producing pure butanol, and consequently an additional 
purification stage is required. 
N-butanol and water form immiscible mixtures at butanol mol fractions ranging from 0.02 to

can be exploited in a phase separator to raise the butanol concentration above the azeotropic 
value. The resulting organic phase can be subsequently distilled in a polishing column to 
produce pure butanol.  
The phase separator was modelled with the decanter unit operation, using the UNIFAC 
property method and specifying water as the key 2nd liquid phase component, and operated 
at 30 °C. However, this operation was not required for the ionic liquid extraction system, as 
the butanol concentration in the separation system outlet was sufficiently high for direct 
distillation.  The final distillation step was modelled using a Radfrac column, containing 10 
theoretical stages (feed above stage 4), a condenser temperature of 30 °C, a molar reflux ratio 
of 1.5 and a molar bottoms to feed ratio of 0.3.  For the IL model, to prevent the butanol 
concentration at the outlet of the 2nd IL stage to fall below the water/butanol azeotrope, the 
bottoms to feed ratio in the polishing column was reduced to 0.1. 
It should be noted that the energy requirements for the polishing column represented a very 
low fraction of the total system heat requirements (~1 %), and consequently its operation was 
no further optimized to prevent associated system instabilities.  
2.5 Model optimization 
Each model was initially optimized at a butanol concentration in the PBR of 1g L-1 , in order to 
identify the best operating conditions for each system.  
The system energy was calculated as the net sum of heating duty, QH, cooling duty, QC, and 
work, W, without energy integration (Equation 7). 
𝑆𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑚 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 = |∑ 𝑄𝐻| + |∑ 𝑄𝐶| + |∑ 𝑊|                                                                                              (7) 
The butanol recovery of each separating stage was calculated as the ratio of the butanol outlet 
flow, Bout, to the total butanol inlet flow, Bin, (including recycle streams) into the separator 
(Equation 8). Absolute values were used to evaluate the effectiveness of individual stages 
15 
 
independent of the overall system (e.g. recycles from other stages) and thereby enable easier 
comparison with alternative system configurations.

The butanol selectivity was calculated as the ratio of the butanol recovery to the recovery of 
all other products (Equation 9).

Where Fin and Fout are the total inlet and outlet flows, respectively. 
After determining the optimal separation parameters, yielding the lowest total system energy 
consumption, the energy requirements were integrated using the Aspen Energy Analysis tool 
and re-optimised if necessary. Subsequently, the separation systems were optimized at 
butanol concentrations of up to 10 g L-1, to determine the corresponding system energy 
requirements. As the butanol concentration generally had a relatively small impact on the 
optimal operating parameters, the results and discussion section only includes data for the 
lowest butanol concentrations of 1 g L-1. Optimized values for higher butanol concentrations 
are discussed in Appendix A.  
2.6 Capital and operating cost estimation 
The total capital and operating costs for each separating system (excluding the PBR) were 
estimated using the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer at a PBR butanol concentration of 
10 g L-1 Capital costs for the pervaporation units were based on the costs of the pervaporation 
membrane, which was quoted at $1350 m-2 (Interstate Speciality Products). The costs for the 
ionic liquid extraction units were calculated from an assumed ionic liquid cost of $100 L-1.  
3 Results and discussion 
This section contains a detailed presentation and discussion of the modelling results of the PBR (3.1) 
and the four different separation systems (3.2 - 3.5). Readers interested in the comparison of the 
16 
 
overall energy requirements and cost estimates for the different separation technologies are referred 
to Sections 3.6 and 3.7.  
3.1 PBR model 
The dynamic growth model for the PBR was based on experimental data for the 
cyanobacterium Synechocysystis PCC 6803 [20], which is one of the strains applied to 
excreted butanol production. The effect of cultivation temperature and light intensity on 
biomass growth was well represented by the selected Aiba and Arrhenius type equations, 
allowing optimization of the operating conditions, with respect to the net biomass growth rate 
(Figure 5). The growth profile shows a typical relationship with respect of temperature, initially 
increasing as the cultivation temperature is raised from 14 °C to 34 °C, followed by a rapid 
drop as the temperature is increased further and the decay term of the growth equation 
(second term of Equation 3) takes over.   
The optimal region for light intensity is much broader, ranging from around 300 to 800 µmol 
(photon) m-2 s-1. However, it is obvious that the light usage efficiency drops with increasing 
light intensity, as the overall growth rate remains constant. Therefore the PBR should be 
operated close   to 34 °C and at light intensities around 200 µmol (photon) m-2 s-1, near the 
lower end of the maximum region.In reality, as local light intensities within the PBR are strongly 
dependent on the reactor type, configuration and operation, they may need to be optimised 
on a case-by-case basis [27,28]. 
As the development of butanol excreting microorganisms is still in its infancy, no reliable data 
exists to allow accurate modelling of the relationship between biomass growth and butanol 
productivity. Consequently, the butanol to biomass production ratio was arbitrarily set to 0.975, 
which at typical biomass concentrations corresponds to butanol titres of approximately 1 g L-
1. Based on similar works with other product excreting strains, it is expected that the optimal 
conditions for butanol formation are significantly different to those for biomass growth [29][30], 
and consequently the model needs to be adjusted to include separate growth and butanol 
production terms once sufficient data is available. Whilst this will have an important impact on 
17 
 
the sizing and operation (nutrient requirement, production of waste biomass) of the PBR, the 
impact on the downstream physical separation process is minor. (The current study is 
predominantly focused on the energies of separation, using absolute concentrations of butanol 
irrespective of biomass concentrations) 
 
Figure 5: Effect of cultivation conditions on growth of Synechocystis PCC 6803 
3.2 Distillation 
The distillation model employs a single distillation column to raise the butanol concentration 
at the phase separator inlet into the immiscible phase region. To optimize the system, a 
sensitivity analysis was run on the two operating specification of the distillation column, the 
molar reflux ratio (MRR) and the distillate to feed mass ratio (DFMR), to evaluate their impact 
on the cumulative system energy requirements (Figure 6a). 
The results show a broad optimum region around a minimum energy value of 192.3 kW at a 
MRR of 1.0 and a DFMR of 0.0065. Raising the MRRs and DFMRs causes only a gradual 
increase in energy requirements, whereas low reflux ratios and low DFMRs result in sharp 
increases in the system energy and the model becomes unstable. Similarly, the energy 
requirements start to increase at high MRRs and DFMRs. 
These trends can be explained as a function of the selectivity (Figure 6b) and recovery of 
butanol from the distillation column (Figure 6c). Increasing the DFMR results in a significant 
reduction in the column selectivity, as increasing amounts of water are carried over into the

distillate. This increases the recycle flow from the decanter to the distillation column, 
increasing the distillation column duty and work associated with pumping. However, as the 
decanter recycle flow is two to three orders of magnitudes smaller than the distillation inlet 
flow from the PBR. the overall impact on the system energy requirements is relatively small. 
At low DFMRs, the butanol concentration in the distillate approaches the limiting azeotropic 
value, causing the recovery of butanol to drop off. This causes the butanol concentrations at 
the PBR inlet to increase, reducing the uptake capacity of the growth medium and resulting in 
an increase in the system flowrate from 1134 kg h-1 at a DFMR of 0.007, to 1834 kg h-1 at a 
ratio of 0.004. As the system energy requirements are predominantly associated with the 
heating and cooling of the distillation inlet and recycle streams, and the column duty itself, any 
increase in the PBR flowrate has a big negative impact on the total energy requirements of 
the system. This can be partially mitigated by increasing the MRR, increasing the efficiency of 
the butanol-water separation and therefore the butanol selectivity. Consequently, at high reflux 
ratios, the optimum DFMR is reduced, resulting in the interdependence observed during the 
energy analysis.  
Further sensitivity analyses were conducted on the column inlet temperature, the number of 
theoretical stages and the feed location (supplementary information), indicating an optimal 
value of nine theoretical stages (close to the specified value of 10). As the feed was subcooled, 
its location had a marginal impact on the system energy requirements and was therefore kept 
at 5. Increasing the column feed temperature from 30 °C to 60 °C had no noticeable impact, 
whereas further temperatures increases caused the system energy requirements to increase. 
This finding can be explained by the partial vaporisation of butanol within the flush drum 
upstream of the distillation columns at temperatures above 60 °C, causing it to be recycled 
back to the PBR and reducing the system efficiency.

which is predominantly associated with the heating (96.5 kW) and cooling (96.2kW) duties, 
whereas the work duty associated with the filtration and pumping of the recycle streams was 
small (0.63 kW).

Table 2: Effect of distillation column inlet temperature on heating and cooling duty of distillation 
system before and after energy integration 
By applying heat integration between the heating and cooling streams, the total system energy 
requirements can be reduced substantially ( 
Table 2). At 60 °C, the system duty is reduced from 192.7 kW to 118.0 kW, representing a 
38.7 % saving. All of these savings are associated with the column preheater and the column 
bottoms recycle cooler, as it is not possible to integrate the energy from the reboiler and 
condenser for the two distillation columns. Consequently, decreasing the column inlet 
temperature from 60 °C to 30 °C eliminates the potential for heat integration, increasing the 
system energy requirements to 188.3 kW. In contrast, increasing the column inlet temperature 
to 70 °C and 80 °C reduces the integrated heat duty to 96.8 kW and 82.8 kW, respectively, 
21 
 
even though the total system energy increases to 201.2 kW and 240.6 kW. At even higher 
inlet temperatures of 90 °C, the heat integration savings no longer compensate for the 
reduction in system efficiency, causing the integrated system duty to increase. 
3.3 Gas stripping 
The most important operating parameters for gas stripping are the stripping temperature and 
stripping gas flow rates, relative to the process flow rates.  Initially, the impact of the 1st and 
2nd stage stripping gas to flow ratios (SGFR) was determined at a constant stripping 
temperature of 80 °C (Figure 7a). This revealed a clear optimum region at 1st stage SGFRs 
between 0.10 and 0.12 and 2nd stage ratios of 0.3. The higher value for the optimum 2nd stage 
ratio can be attributed to the reduced overall second stage inlet flow, whilst the amount of 
butanol to be recovered remains approximately equal. As the overall energy requirements 
appeared more sensitive to changes in the 1st stage ratio than the 2nd stage ratio, the analysis 
was repeated with a fixed 2nd stage SGFR of 0.3, whilst optimizing the first stage ratio and 
stripping temperature (Figure 7b). The results show that an increase in stripping temperature 
reduces the optimal SGFR leading to a minimum system energy requirement of 564.6 kW at 
a SGFR of 0.05 and a stripping temperature of 86 °C. This can be attributed to the increase 
in butanol vapour pressure as the stripping temperature is increased and consequently less 
dilution with stripping gas is required to achieve the same degree of butanol recovery 
(Supplementary information). Improved butanol recovery reduces the butanol recycling to the 
PBR and therefore results in lower system flowrates and upstream energy requirements. At 
the same time, increasing the stripping ratio and temperature also results in a steady decline 
in butanol selectivity from 18.6 to 7.5 as the amount of water carried over is increased 
22 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Optimisation results for gas stripping model. (a) Effect of 1st and 2nd stage stripping 
gas to process flow ratios, (b) Effect of 1st stage stripping gas to process flow ratio and 
stripping temperature.  
The temperatures of the stripping gas condensers were found to have a relatively minor effect 
on the system performance, provided they were sufficiently low to condense out the majority 
of butanol (results not shown). Therefore, the condenser temperature was kept at its optimal 
temperature of  20 °C for all subsequent modelling to evaluate the heat integration potential 
of the gas stripping system. 
3.4 Pervaporation 
Initially, the pervaporation system was modelled with constant pervaporation temperatures of 
60 °C, to investigate the effect of varying the 1st and 2nd stage stagecuts (Figure 8a). The 
results show a clear optimum value for the 1st pervaporation stage stagecut of 0.03, whereas

the impact of the second stage ratio on the overall system energy requirements is much lower. 
This is unsurprising, as the heat duty of the 1st stage is an order of magnitude higher than for 
the second stage, where only a fraction of the 1st stage flow is processed.Consequently, the 
effect of varying the pervaporation temperature at different 1st stage pervaporation stagecuts 
was investigated (Figure 8b). This revealed an optimum region at stagecuts between 0.02 and 
0.04 and pervaporation temperatures between 60 °C and 70 °C and unlike the distillation and 
gas stripping system, the two optima appear to be independent of each other. 
The trends for butanol selectivities (Figure 8c) and recoveries (Figure 8d) show opposite 
effects with regards to stagecut values. Increasing the stagecut increases butanol recovery, 
but reduces selectivity, and consequently a compromise must be found between the upstream 
(excessive butanol recycling) and downstream (excessive water carry-over) energy 
requirements. In contrast, both selectivity and recovery are increased at higher pervaporation 
temperatures. Nonetheless, the increase in the pervaporation efficiency must be balanced 
against the increase in the associated heating and cooling requirements. An interesting 
observation are the low butanol selectivities at low pervaporator temperatures. These can be 
attributed to the low butanol vapour pressures at these temperatures, increasing the relative 
fraction of the gaseous components (oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide) that are transferred 
across the membrane. Due to the low permeate stream pressure (0.01 bar), the condenser 
temperatures must be kept at a value of 5 °C or lower, to ensure the condensation of butanol 
in the knock-out pots. Meanwhile, increasing the pervaporation outlet pressure from 0.01 to 
0.1 bar results in a steady increase in system energy requirements, as the butanol flux across 
the membrane is reduced, whilst the membrane area also increases by an order of magnitude 
from 24.8 m2 to 113.0 m2. 
Similar to the distillation option, considering energy integration increasing the optimum 
pervaporation temperature to a value between 80 °C and 90 °C (

The ionic liquid extraction model was first run at a constant flash temperature of 170 °C, whilst 
varying the 1st and 2nd stage ionic liquid to feed ratios (ILFR, Figure 9a). To prevent the butanol 
concentration at the outlet of the 2nd IL stage to fall below the water/butanol azeotrope, the 
bottoms to feed ratio in the polishing column was reduced to 0.1. The lowest system energy 
was obtained at 1st stage ILFRs between 0.6 and 0.7, whereas at values above around 1.5, 
the 2nd stage ratio had little impact on the energy requirements.  
Consequently, the model was rerun with a fixed 2nd stage ILFR of 1.5, whilst varying the 1st 
stage ratio and flash temperature (Figure 9b). In this case, an optimal region is observed at 
temperatures ranging from 170 °C to 180 °C and ILFRs of 0.5 to 0.7.

Increasing the 1st stage ILFR from 0.2 to 1.1 results in a 4- to 5-fold increase in butanol 
recovery (Figure 9c). As a result, the system flowrate through the PBR can be substantially 
reduced from 1295 kg h-1 to 5958 kg h-1 (175 °C). Whilst this has a relatively minor effect on 
the system energy requirements, as the process flow is processed at the cultivation 
temperature, and therefore requires no heating or cooling, the increase in flowrate would result 
in a significant increase in the upstream capital costs, as well as having potentially adverse 
effects on the algae culture itself. Decreasing the ILFR from 1.1 to 0.6 results in a small 
reduction in the total IL flow from 1417 kg h-1 to 1187 kg h-1, but further reductions cause the 
IL flow to increase, as the IL reaches its butanol saturation limit.  
Increasing the IL flash temperature from 150 °C to 195 °C increases the butanol recovery by 
up to 50 %, as the uptake capacity of the regenerated IL is increased (less residual butanol). 
However, as the temperature increases above 185 °C, the incremental increase in IL capacity 
is outweighed by the additional heating and cooling requirements, resulting in the system 
energy to increase. These results are also demonstrated by the trends in the 1st stage butanol 
selectivity, which increase with reducing ILFR and increasing flash temperatures (Figure 9d). 
However, at IL/flow ratios below 0.6 and temperatures above 175 °C the incremental increase 
in butanol selectivity is negligible, and therefore the system should not be operated beyond 
these values. 
3.6 Comparison of separation technologies  
3.6.1 Energy requirements 
Using the modelling results for the individual separation processes, it is possible to extrapolate 
the data to predict the break-even butanol concentrations at which the separation energy 
drops below the energy content of the fuel (Figure 10). This reveals significant differences in 
the energy requirements of the different separation technologies.

Figure 10: Comparison of butanol break-even concentrations for different separation 
technologies 
For the baseline scenario (distillation), the model predicts a break-even butanol concentration 
of 9.3 g L-1. Whilst this is higher than the value obtained by Vane and Alvarez (~ 5 g L-1)[16], 
their work did not include the cooling duties, which account for almost 50 % of our energy 
value.  These results also compare favourably to those by Luyben, who estimated an energy 
penalty of 9.1 MJ  kg-1 at a butanol concentration of 77.5 g L-1 only for the operation of the 
distillation column [15], compared to 9.4 MJ kg-1 from our model for the whole separation 
system. 
The results for the gas stripping model, with a break-even concentration of 16.9 g L-1, suggest 
that this technology is significantly less efficient than the baseline distillation scenario and 
therefore appears unsuitable for the recovery of butanol from dilute mixtures. This can be 
attributed to the high energy requirements of heating and cooling of the stripping gas, and 
increased latent heat losses as a result of the low separation selectivity, which exceed the 
energy savings associated with reducing the evaporation temperature from 99 °C at the 
distillation bottom to 83 °C in the stripping column (10 g L-1). However, as the stripping 
temperature reduces with increasing butanol concentrations, it is possible that gas stripping

becomes more suitable for the recovery of butanol from more concentrated fermentation 
cultures, which are closer to the immiscible phase region. 
At low butanol concentrations, the energy requirements for pervaporation are very similar to 
those for the base case scenario, but are slightly increased at higher concentrations, resulting 
in a higher break-even concentration of 10.3 g L-1, compared to 9.3 g L-1 for distillation. These 
results can be predominantly attributed to the low condenser temperatures (< 5 °C) required 
for the pervaporator outlet streams, reducing the potential for heat integration from 78.5 % for 
distillation, to 63.5 % for pervaporation. Consequently, the energy use after heat integration 
exceeds that of distillation, despite a much lower total energy use of 264.5 kW (compared to 
442.2 kW for distillation). A potential solution could be the compression of the permeate stream 
prior to condensation, however the compression of the non-ideal fluids (water and butanol) 
results in temperatures of several hundreds of degrees, requiring a number of intercooling 
stages. 
Finally, the energy requirements for IL extraction are much lower than for distillation, with a 
break-even concentration of only 3.7 g L-1. This can be mostly attributed to the elimination of 
the heating and cooling of the main PBR process stream, as the liquid extraction can be 
conducted at cultivation temperature. In addition, the subsequent recovery of butanol from the 
ionic liquid is very efficient, due to the negligible vapour pressure of the solvent.  
3.7 Economic considerations 
To evaluate the capital and operating costs associated with the recovery of butanol via the 
different technologies, the models were analysed using the Aspen Process Economic 
Analyzer, for a pilot scale facility producing 100 kg of butanol per hour at a concentration of 
10 g L-1 (Error! Reference source not found.). 
Technology Equipment cost Capital cost  Utilities cost Operating costs 
Distillation $ 1,445 k $ 5,827 k $ 503.6 k $ 1,810 k 
Pervaporation $ 3,158 k $ 9,161 k $ 478.1 k $ 2,178 k 
31 
 
Gas stripping $ 2,902 k $ 8,522 k $ 856.4 k $ 2,578 k 
IL extraction $ 2,655 k $ 6,895 k $ 542.0 k $ 1,520 k 
 
Table 4: Cost estimations for the four separation technologies at a butanol concentration of 
10 g L-1 and production rate of 100 kg h-1 
Unlike the energy requirements, the total installed cost for the distillation baseline scenario is 
significantly lower than for the other three systems. In the case of IL extraction, the recovery 
cost is significantly increased due to the cost of the ionic liquid solvent itself ($1,272 k), 
whereas the high costs of the pervaporation and gas stripping system can be mostly attributed 
to the costs of the gas compressors. In contrast, the pervaporation membranes contribute a 
relatively minor fraction to the total installed costs ($62,838). From these results, it would be 
desirable to find a cheaper recovery solvent, but unfortunately it is very difficult to find solvents 
that are both hydrophobic and have a sufficiently high interaction with butanol. Nonetheless, 
it is likely that as ILs become more established industrially, their commercial costs will reduce. 
In addition, further research should focus on the identification of cheaper IL candidates. 
Interestingly, the utility costs for the pervaporation system are the lowest, even though this 
technology is only the 3rd most energy efficient. This can be attributed to the relatively low 
electrical energy requirements of 55.9 kW, compared to 270.8 kW for IL extraction, which is 
significantly more expensive to supply than steam and cooling water. However, the total 
operating costs remain above those for distillation and IL extraction, presumably as a result of 
the high maintenance costs of the gas compressors. The lowest operating costs are achieved 
from the IL system, however this does not account for the degradation and loss of ionic liquid 
into the growth medium. In addition, the toxicological impacts of IL extraction on algae cultures 
have yet to be investigated, whereas the other three technologies would not be expected to 
effect the viability of the culture.

4 Conclusions 
The recovery of butanol from dilute growth cultures constitutes a major cost in the 
development of production systems based on genetically engineered cyanobacteria. By 
conducting extensive process modelling, we were able to provide a like-for-like comparison of 
the energy requirements of four of the most promising butanol separation technologies. In all 
cases, the break-even concentrations, at which the separation energy drops below the energy 
content of the fuel, are substantially higher than the butanol concentrations currently achieved 
in the literature. With a break-even concentration of 3.7 g L-1 ionic liquid extraction (ILE) is by 
far the most energy efficient separation technology, as it eliminates the heating of the entire 
cultivation broth. The pervaporation process appears to be limited by the low temperatures 
required to condense butanol from the low-pressure permeate, reducing the potential for heat 
integration and raising the energy requirements above the distillation base case. In contrast, 
gas stripping is significantly more energy intensive than all other technologies and therefore 
does not appear to offer any discernible advantages. 
Despite the significant difference in energy requirements, the ILE process is only slightly 
cheaper to run than distillation and significantly more expensive to install, owing to the high 
costs of the ionic liquid. Even at 10 g L-1, the projected operating costs of $1.74 kg-1(butanol) 
appear quite high compared to the value of the product. This suggests that the butanol 
concentrations required for economic operation are significantly higher than the calculated 
break-even concentrations, although costs could be reduced by changing the scale of the 
facility. In addition, the current work only considers the butanol product itself, whilst the 
process also yields significant amounts of waste biomass. Utilisation of this biomass could 
represent an additional product stream, reducing the costs associated with biofuel production. 
It should also be noted that besides energy efficiency, the viability of the different separation 
systems also depends on other factors (e.g. environmental, safety, reliability) which have not 
been evaluated in this study. Future work should therefore consider the whole life-cycle 
perspectives of this process to provide an even more robust comparison. More detailed life

APPENDIX A: Effect of butanol concentration on optimized 
model parameters 
Increasing the butanol concentration from 1 g L-1 to 10 g L-1 had a small impact on some of 
the optimised parameters for the four separation systems. 
In the case of the distillation option, increasing the butanol concentration had a minimal impact 
on the MRR, whereas the DFMR had to be increased from 0.0065 to 0.018, to maintain a 
sufficiently high butanol recovery from the column. At the same time, the optimal feed 
temperature, after energy integration, increased from 80 °C to 90 °C. 
For the gas stripping option, the optimal 1st stage stripping ratio increased gradually from 0.05 
at 1 g L-1 to 0.08 at 10 g L-1, whilst the optimal stripping temperature reduced from 86 °C to 
83 °C.  
Re-optimising the pervaporation system at higher butanol inlet concentrations resulted in a 
slight increase in the 2nd stage stagecut from 0.13 to 0.17, whilst the 1st stage stagecut and 
pervaporation temperature remained unchanged at 0.03 and 90 °C, respectively. 
34 
 
In the case of ionic liquid reduction, the 1st stage ILFR reduced slightly from 0.6 to 0.5, whilst 
the flash temperature reduced from 180 °C to 165 °C, as the effect of recycling slightly higher 
butanol concentrations to the PBR becomes less important.
