Abstract: Green infrastructure (GI) contributes to improve urban drainage and also has other societal
and environmental benefits that grey infrastructure usually does not have. Economic assessment for
urban drainage planning and decision making often focuses on flood criteria. This study presents an
economic assessment of GI based on a conventional cost-benefit analysis (CBA) that includes several
benefits related to urban drainage (floods, combined sewer overflows and waste water treatment),
environmental impacts (receiving water bodies) and additional societal and environmental benefits
associated with GI (air quality improvements, aesthetic values, etc.). Benefits from flood damage
reduction are monetized based on the widely used concept of Expected Annual Damage (EAD) that
was calculated using a 1D/2D urban drainage model together with design storms and a damage
model based on tailored flood depth–damage curves. Benefits from Combined Sewer Overflows
(CSO) damage reduction were monetized using a 1D urban drainage model with continuous rainfall
simulations and prices per cubic meter of spilled combined sewage water estimated from literature;
other societal benefits were estimated using unit prices also estimated from literature. This economic
assessment was applied to two different case studies: the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Badalona.
The results are useful for decision making and also underline the relevancy of including not only
flood damages in CBA of GI.
Keywords: urban flood; water quality; cost-benefit analysis; modelling; combined sewer overflows
1. Introduction
Green infrastructure (GI)—also recognized with the acronyms NBS (Nature-Based Solutions),
SUDS (Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems), LID (Low Impact Development), BMP (Best Management
Practices), WSUD (Water Sensitive Urban Design) and many others [1]—contributes to improve
urban stormwater management and has several other societal benefits like air quality improvements,
reduction of heat island effects, aesthetic and recreational values, and others [2]. Socio-economic
assessment of GI is an important tool for urban drainage planning and decision making of climate
change adaptation strategies [3].
Several studies have presented socio-economic assessments of different climate change adaptation
options focusing on direct and indirect benefits derived from flood damage reduction capacity of GI.
Velasco et al. [4] presented a cost-benefit analysis where only direct benefits were included in terms of
avoided flood damages obtained by different adaptation scenarios in Barcelona: structural measures

(pipe enlargement and stormwater tanks), GI, flood barriers for ground floor doors of businesses
and private buildings and early-warning systems. Zhou et al. [3,5] presented a framework and its
application to a Danish case study for economic assessment of different climate adaptation options
focusing on flood impacts. The economical assessment was based on a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) with
direct and indirect benefits derived from flood damage reduction that were monetized using flood
models together with damage costs for houses, basements, sewers, roads, lakes and people health and
also administrative and traffic delay costs. The damage costs were calculated using unit costs reported
from case-specific literature. In these papers, flood adaptation options based on pipe enlargements
were compared to stormwater infiltration through GI focusing on flood reduction benefits.
Further studies present socio-economic assessments including additional benefits not only related
to direct or indirect flood damages [6]. Löwe et al. [7] presented a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for
comparing different flood adaptation options in Australia. The flood adaptation options consisting
of pipe enlargement, flood zoning and rainwater harvesting through GI were compared including
flood reduction benefits and also additional benefits derived from reduction of drinking water
consumption. Zhou et al. [8] presented an integrated hydrological cost-benefit analysis for comparison
of different climate adaptation options such as open urban drainage systems, pipe enlargement and
local stormwater infiltration. Here, benefits derived from flood damage reduction were integrated
with additional monetized benefits derived from increased property values in the areas where GI was
planned and the consequent increase in property taxes. Finally, Cooper et al. [9] presented an integrated
costs-benefits analysis of a berm (sea wall) to mitigate the effects of coastal flooding from sea storms.
Here, the monetized benefits of the project included: avoided costs derived from building damages,
management expenses, fatalities, debris removal, utility and municipal damages; benefits derived
from recreational and health value and indirect costs derived from interruption of key transportation
and commercial infrastructure located in the area. The recreational and health values were linked to
the ecosystem services and health benefits to the surrounding community generated by the planned
green areas along the berm.
Further studies underlined the importance of analyzing GI with a multidisciplinary approach.
Venkataramanan et al. [10] presented a multidisciplinary literature review focusing on the interaction
between human dimensions and socio-ecological-technical systems that are involved with GI in the
context of flood risk management. Additionally, Wilkerson et al. [11] analyzed the role of socio-economic
factors involved in the planning and management of urban ecosystem services.
The aim of this paper is to present a cost-benefit analysis that includes multiple benefits derived
from green infrastructure in the context of urban drainage planning. The novelty of this study is the
integration of water quantity and quality and other socio-economic benefits into CBA of GI in the
context of urban drainage planning. The application of this analysis to two different case studies can
also be considered as novel since the application of CBA is generally used for comparing different
adaptation measures within the case study. GI benefits are calculated from direct and indirect flood
impacts reduction, water quality related benefits and additional societal benefits. Benefits of flood
damage reduction are calculated as avoided direct and indirect flood damage costs to buildings,
vehicles, urban infrastructure and indirect costs. Flood damage costs are calculated using coupled 1D
urban drainage and 2D surface runoff models together with tailored depth–damage and permeability
coefficients functions. Water quality related benefits derived from CSO and waste water treatment
cost reduction are calculated using a 1D urban drainage model and costs of wastewater treatment
and CSO spills obtained from literature. Finally, additional societal benefits like increased aesthetic
value, air quality improvement, habitat provision and reduced urban heat island effect and energy
consumption, are calculated based on unit costs from literature. The socio-economic assessment is
applied to two different case studies: the Spanish municipalities of Barcelona and Badalona. These two
case studies were part of the two European H2020 research projects: BINGO (Bringing Innovation to
onGOing water management. www.projectbingo.eu) and RESCCUE (Resilience to Cope with Climate
Change in Urban Areas. www.resccue.eu). The aim of presenting two cases is mainly to show that

the methodology can be applied to different cases. Nevertheless, the comparison can also bring new
points of view in the discussion of GI in the context of urban drainage planning. The methodology
proposed can be considered generally applicable to other cities in the context of green infrastructure
and urban drainage planning.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. The Two Case Studies
2.1.1. The Case Study of Barcelona
Barcelona (Figure 1) has an extension of approximately 100 km2, 1,619,000 inhabitants and it is
highly urbanized. An important part of its urban development lies in a flat area up to few tens of
meters above mean sea level. The city faces the Mediterranean Sea and approximately half of its coast
line is occupied by the harbor and the remaining by sandy beaches. In the opposite side of the sea,
there are hills with significant slopes towards the urban area. The great majority of the drainage system
is a combined one and Barcelona experiences urban pluvial floods due to intense rainfalls, steep slopes
towards the flat urban area, high degree of imperviousness and, in recent years, expansion of new
urban areas draining into an older drainage system. The mean annual rainfall is 612 mm/y, the degree
of imperviousness is estimated to be approximately 70% of the whole municipal area even though
it can reach much higher percentages in the urban areas (see for instance the two zoom-in areas in
Figure 1). The city also experiences Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) that generally occur during
rainfall events larger than a few millimeters. CSOs pollute the river Besos (that coincides with the
north-eastern boundary of the municipal area shown in Figure 1) and the sea water both in front of the
beaches and in the harbor. Figure 1 also shows the planned GI that will be described in Section 2.2.1.

2.1.2. The Case Study of Badalona
Badalona (Figure 2), within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area, has an extension of approximately
21 km2, 215,000 inhabitants (the fourth most populated city in Catalonia) and it is highly urbanized.
An important part of its urban development lies in a flat area up to few tens of meters above mean sea
level. In the north and north-western part of the municipality there are hills with significant slopes
towards the urban area. On the opposite side the city has approximately 5 km of sandy beaches facing
the Mediterranean Sea. Badalona experiences urban pluvial floods due to intense rainfalls, steep slopes
towards the flat urban areas, high degree of imperviousness and, in recent years, expansion of new
urban areas draining into an older drainage system. The mean annual rainfall is 568 mm/y, the degree
of imperviousness is estimated to be approximately 57% of the whole municipal area even though
it can reach much higher percentages in the urban areas (see for instance the two zoom-in areas in
Figure 2). Almost all the drainage system is a combined one and CSOs that generally occur during
rainfall events larger than a few millimeters pollute the sea water. Figure 2 also shows the planned GI
that will be described in Section 2.2.3.

2.2. The Climate Change Adaptation Scenarios
Green infrastructure was one out of the several climate change adaptation options (do nothing,
pipe enlargement, new pipes and detention storages and early-warning systems) proposed and
analyzed in agreement with the different local stakeholders. In this study, two different adaptation
scenarios with future rainfalls are presented: the business as usual (BAU) scenario where no adaptation
Sustainability 2020, 12, 3792 5 of 18
is considered, and the GI scenario. The BAU scenario is used as a reference scenario when calculating
benefits as part of the cost-benefit analysis. Both BAU and GI scenarios were based on future simulated
rainfalls. Two kinds of future rainfalls were estimated for each of the two case studies: a future design
storm event relevant for single event flood simulations and a future continuous rainfall time series
relevant for continuous urban water simulations that aimed at stimulating combined sewer overflows,
water quality impacts on the Mediterranean Sea and annual combined sewer water fluxes at waste
water treatment plants. The future design storm events were calculated by applying climate factors (CF)
to current design storm events according to Arnbjerg-Nielsen et al. [12]. It is noted that significantly
different approaches were used in Barcelona and Badalona in order to derive CF. In Barcelona the 50th
percentiles of all Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 8.5 and 4.5 scenarios were used to
compute CF as a function of both different return periods and rainfall durations. Instead, in Badalona
the average values of RCP 8.5 were used to compute CF as a function of different return periods.
Nevertheless, the obtained climate values are in both cases within the range proposed in other local
studies [13]. Details on the derivation of CF and future rainfall time series are provided in the following.
Further future climate variables like temperature, sea level rise, wind, solar radiation, etc., were not
considered in the current climate change adaptation scenarios even though they likely impact the
future urban drainage systems and GI performances [14].
2.2.1. Green Infrastructure in Barcelona
The proposed GI in Barcelona was agreed with local project stakeholders and it was mostly derived
from a study of the Municipality of Barcelona [15] that aimed at increasing stormwater exploitation in
the city. Three different types of GI were proposed: green roofs, bioretention cells and retention and
detention basins. Figure 1 shows the location of GI throughout Barcelona. Extensive green roofs are
assumed to be retrofitted to approximately 5% (143 ha) of all the roof area of Barcelona. This percentage
was derived from a study for the Municipality of Barcelona [16] that analyzed the roof areas suitable for
green roof retrofitting. Bioretention cells with a total area of approximately 181 ha are supposed to be
implemented in almost all the streets of Barcelona as shown in Figure 1. The location and preliminary
design of these bioretention systems were proposed in a study for the Municipality of Barcelona [15]
that suggested five different spatial distribution and capacity of bioretention systems depending on
street slope and width (the five street types classified were presented in Figure 1). The proposed
systems are made of a top soil and vegetation layer and a deeper layer of more porous material
for water detention and infiltration into the underlying soil. The bioretention cells are devised for
managing stormwater runoff from part or the whole streets where they are built. Finally, ten retention
and detention basins with a total volume of 128,700 m3 are supposed to be located at the upstream
parts of the urban area in order to collect stormwater runoff from the upstream rural areas for a 10-year
return period design storm. Approximately half of the basin volume is allocated to retention with
infiltration into the ground and the rest to detention and reduction of peak stormwater runoff. Other
examples of the combination of retention and detention volumes can be found in the literature [17].
Overall, the GI implementation in Barcelona would reduce the total impervious area by
approximately 14% for all the modelled area. Nevertheless, this reduction is higher in the city
center reaching approximately 29%. It is noted that bioretention cells and retention and detention
basins do manage stormwater runoff from their associated catchment areas (larger areas compared to
their physical construction areas).
2.2.2. The Future Rainfalls in Barcelona
The future rainfalls in Barcelona were computed based on the results of CMIP5 climate models
considering the RCP scenarios 8.5 and 4.5. Downscaling methods were then applied and verified
using both the ERA-Interim re-analysis as a reference for reproducing the past climate variables and
other statistical indicators. Future rainfalls were finally derived using both rainfall observations from
local rain gauges and different atmospheric circulation models: ACCESS1, BCC-CSM1, CanESM2,
Sustainability 2020, 12, 3792 6 of 18
CNRM-CM5, GFDL-ESM2M, HADGEM2-CC, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3 and
NorESM1. Each model provided past (1951–2005) and future (2021–2100) rainfall time series.
The CF used for flood simulations were computed for both different rainfall durations (5, 10,
15 min, etc.) and different return periods (T = 1, 10, 50, 100 and 500 y) by calculating the rainfall
intensity ratio between the simulated future (2071–2010) and simulated historical period (1976–2005).
The computed CF were in the range between 1.07 and 1.26 and corresponded to the 50th percentile of
the predicted RCP 8.5 and 4.5 scenarios.
The future rainfall time series used for continuous urban water simulations was selected to be
the same as the actual one. This choice came after analyzing the predicted future rainfall volume
and annual number of rainfall events. The 50th percentile of the latter two variables did not show an
increase in the future and therefore, together with the project stakeholders, it was decided to keep
the current rainfall time series for continuous urban water simulations of the future climate change
adaptation scenarios.
2.2.3. Green Infrastructure in Badalona
The proposed GI in Badalona was agreed together with local project stakeholders that spotted
realistic near-future implementation areas. Three different types of GI were selected for the adaptation
scenario: green roofs, permeable pavements and infiltration trenches (Figure 2). Extensive green roofs
are assumed to be retrofitted to 5% of all the roof area of Badalona. Permeable pavements with a total
area of 47,000 m2 are supposed to be implemented in 7 different public squares and parks. Infiltration
trenches are supposed to be implemented in 5 different public parks that have a total area of 298,372 m2.
These trenches are supposed to retain and infiltrate into the ground both the impervious and pervious
stormwater runoff from the parks (mostly pervious areas) generated by a design storm of 10 years
return period. A total trench volume of 1923 m3 was estimated (assuming a 95% porosity of the trench
filling material).
Overall, the planned GI implementation in Badalona would reduce the total impervious area by
approximately 2%. It is noted that infiltration trenches do not reduce impervious areas; however, they
do manage stormwater runoff from their associated catchment areas.
2.2.4. The Future Rainfalls in Badalona
Two different sources of future climate data were used in the case of Badalona. The future
design storm events for flood simulations were obtained from climate projections results of the
EURO-CORDEX project (www.euro-cordex.net) while the future rainfall time series for continuous
urban water simulations were obtained from the decadal climate predictions of the Miklip project
(www.fona-miklip.de) that were derived from the model MPI-ESM (www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/science/
models/mpi-esm/).
The CF used for flood simulations were obtained by calculating the 24 h rainfall intensity ratio
between future projections (2051–2100) and historical simulated rainfall (1951–2005). Three different
RCP scenarios were analyzed: 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6. The CF obtained with average rainfall intensities from
RCP 8.5 scenarios were the ones selected together with the project stakeholders for flood simulations.
A CF of 1.15 for the 2-year return period design storm was obtained, 1.07 for the 10-year, 1.02 for
the 100-year and 1.01 for the 500-year. In this case, the same climate factor is applied to all rainfall
durations. Calculating climate factors from 24 h rainfall intensity ratio can be a limitation [18].
The future rainfall time series used for continuous urban water simulations were obtained in two
steps: first, the daily rainfall was obtained using the Daily Spatio-Temporal Stochastic Precipitation
Generator [19]; then, disaggregation of daily rainfall into 5 min values was made using a stochastic
method that combined both the Bartlett–Lewis process [20] and further procedures (included into
the R package ‘HyetosMinute’) in order to reproduce the 5 min rainfall observations from local rain
gauges. This procedure provided an ensemble of 10 different time series with both historical and future
rainfall. Only a single time series representing average future rainfall conditions was selected and
Sustainability 2020, 12, 3792 7 of 18
used for continuous simulations with the urban drainage and the sea water quality model (presented
in Section 2.3.2).
2.3. The Cost-Benefit Analysis
2.3.1. Costs
The capital (CAPEX) and operation and maintenance (OPEX) costs of the planned green
infrastructure are based on unit costs obtained from both literature and local experience. The costs
ranges found in provider websites, unpublished documents and literature have generally a large
spread. In this cost-benefit analysis (CBA) the costs were derived partly from literature [21] and partly
from unpublished documents and internal research projects. The different costs were converted into
the same year value using consumer price indices. The CAPEX of extensive green roofs are assumed to
be 80 €/m2 and the OPEX 2.33 €/m2/y. Bianchini et al. [22] reported a CAPEX range of 120–152 €/m2
and an OPEX one of 1–12 €/m2 for extensive green roofs. The CAPEX of bioretention cells are 45 €/m2
plus 2.25 €/m2 for plant implementation and the OPEX 0.45 €/m3/y. The CAPEX of detention and
retention ponds are 100 €/m2 and the annual OPEX is 1.49% of the CAPEX. The CAPEX of permeable
pavements are 49.5 €/m2 and the OPEX 1.375 €/m3/y. The CAPEX of infiltration trenches are assumed to
be 185 €/m3 and additional 742 €/m3 the OPEX 50 €/m3/y. The additional CAPEX of infiltration trenches
in this case include the costs of additional manholes, inlets and pipes that need to be constructed
since these systems are supposed to be constructed into a public park area where existing drainage
connections are limited. The estimated CAPEX of the infiltration trenches proposed in Badalona are
similar to the costs paid by the municipality for an executed project. Zhou et al. [8,23] used investment
costs of infiltration trenches in the range between 16 and 91 €/m2. Alves et al. [6] estimated annual
OPEX as 3% of CAPEX costs.
The lifetime of an infrastructure can vary depending on Its maintenance: the higher the
maintenance costs the longer the lifetime [24]. In Badalona extraordinary maintenance was assumed to
be carried out every 20 years with a cost equal to the 23% of the CAPEX at each intervention. Similarly,
in Barcelona it was assumed every 20 years for bioretention cells and 50 years for green roofs and
retention and detention ponds with a cost equal to the 50% of the CAPEX at each intervention.
Residual GI value at the end of the project evaluation period was also considered according to
European recommendations for evaluations of investments [25]. This reflects the value of the remaining
potential use of GI since its services will be provided further beyond the end of the CBA evaluation
period [25]. In this study, it was considered as a negative cost but it could also be considered as a
benefit as the choice does not affect the net present value Equation (1) (it only affects the graphical
presentation of cost and benefits).
2.3.2. Benefits
Several benefits can be included into CBA of green infrastructure [5,9,14]. Benefits can be direct
and indirect, tangible (i.e., that can be quantified in monetary values) and intangibles [26]. In this study,
direct and indirect tangible benefits are taken into consideration. The benefits of the GI scenario were
calculated as avoided damages (or added values) compared to the BAU scenario that is considered to
be the reference as typically done in similar CBA [3,5]. In this study, the benefits were organized into 3
different categories for a better representation and discussion of the results:
• Benefits derived from flood damage reduction. Benefits are defined as avoided direct and indirect
flood damage costs. Flood damage costs were quantified in terms of Expected Annual Damage
(EAD) using a 1D/2D urban drainage model together with design storms and a damage model
based on tailored flood depth–damage curves [27]. The direct flood damages were quantified for
infrastructure, vehicles, buildings and assets, while the indirect damages for business interruption.
• Benefits derived from water quality improvements. Benefits are defined as avoided direct and
indirect damage costs. The direct damages are quantified as environmental costs produced by
Sustainability 2020, 12, 3792 8 of 18
CSO spills to receiving water bodies and for avoided costs of combined sewage treatment. Indirect
damages are monetized for coastal economies that are affected by the polluted water.
• Additional benefits. Additional indirect benefits are monetized considering: increased aesthetic
value, air quality improvement, reduction of the urban heat island effect and energy consumption,
and habitat provision [22,24].
Direct flood damages in both Barcelona and Badalona were quantified using coupled 1D/2D
(urban drainage/overland flow) models and damage models based on tailored flood damage curves
(developed for indoor flood water levels) and permeability coefficient curves that were developed
together with flood insurance experts [27]. The damage model takes as inputs the deterministic and
spatially distributed values of maximum flood depth simulated with the 1D/2D urban drainage model.
The simulated flood depth from the 1D/2D model (considered as outdoor flood depth) is converted
into building indoor water levels using the permeability coefficient curves and then the flood damage
curves are applied to indoor water levels. In the case of buildings with basements further model
parameters control the indoor flood water exchange from ground floor to lower floors. Both the flood
models and the damage models (of Barcelona and Badalona) were calibrated and validated using
historical data. The flood models used water level data in the drainage network, rain gauge data and
photos of urban floods during different past rain events. The damage models used flood insurance
compensation data from different flood events during the last few decades [27]. The most influential
model parameters of the 1D/2D model were the roughness coefficients of pipes and urban surfaces and
of the damage model the parameters controlling the indoor flood water level exchange from ground
floor to lower floors [27].
The 1D/2D model provides the maximum simulated flood depth for different design storms of
different return periods between 1 and 500 years: 1, 10, 50, 100 and 500 years for Barcelona and 2, 10,
100 and 500 for Badalona. For each return period, the total flood damages at the urban scale were
calculated by multiplying the maximum simulated flood depth at each cadastral parcel by permeability
coefficients and flood depth–damage curves that were specifically tailored for Badalona and Barcelona
for different land uses (hotels, warehouses, restaurants, dwellings, car parks, etc.) and vehicles [28].
The permeability coefficient curves were used to transform the 2D simulated flood levels on the urban
floodable area into indoor water levels. Finally, Expected Annual Damage (EAD) was calculated
including both direct and indirect damages as detailed in a previous study of Badalona [27]. Indirect
flood damages due to business interruptions were estimated at 29% of the total direct damages using an
input–output model [27]. This percentage is in the range of other studies that proposed 19–39% [29,30].
The 1D/2D hydrodynamic models were developed with InfoWorks ICM (www.innovyze.com)
and calibrated and validated using local rainfall and water level data. The 1D sewer model of Badalona
includes approximately 368 km of pipes, 11,338 manholes, 11,954 sub-catchments, 62 weirs, 4 sluice
gates, and 1 detention tank of 30,000 m3. The 2D model has 199,338 cells that form an unstructured
mesh generated from a digital terrain model (DTM) of 2 m2 resolution obtained by a LIDAR with a
precision of approximately 15 cm for the altitudes. The size of the 2D cells is in the range of 16–64 m2
in the urban areas where most of the flood damages occur. The 1D sewer model of Barcelona includes
approximately 2041 km of pipes, 85,834 manholes, 980 weirs, 44 sluice gates, 75 pumps and 285 storage
nodes representing different kinds of chambers and 10 detention tanks with a total volume of more
than 400,000 m3. The 2D model has 1,361,324 cells that form an unstructured mesh generated from a
digital terrain model (DTM) of 2 m2 resolution obtained from a LIDAR. The size of the 2D cells is in
the range of 25–100 m2.
Direct and indirect water quality benefits were computed using continuous simulation of a 1D
urban drainage model to estimate annual volumes of CSO and combined sewage water sent at the
treatment plant. The urban drainage models used were the 1D/2D models presented earlier but without
the 2D overland flow model. The urban drainage models were then coupled to a sea water quality
model [31] to simulate the sea water contamination from CSOs and to estimate the average duration
of insufficient bathing water quality. The duration of insufficient bathing water quality was used as
Sustainability 2020, 12, 3792 9 of 18
an input to a coastal economy model that estimates indirect damages to coastal economies caused by
pollution of bathing waters and the consequent reduction of sea related leisure, sport and restoration
activities. The coastal economy model includes different contributions. First, the daily direct added
value of the coastal economy was calculated by selecting the expected business sectors affected by a
beach closure (restaurants, small retails and maritime sector). This selection was based on the results
of a field study based on surveys to beach goers and personal interviews to coastal business owners
carried out in Barcelona and Badalona (see both H2020 BINGO and RESCCUE projects). Second, based
on data from Barcelona’s economic annual report [32] a 50% share of the annual coastal economic
added value was assumed to come from the bathing season [33], which lasts approximately 3–4 months
in Badalona and Barcelona. Only the direct added value of coastal districts (identified by comparing
the CSO spill points with the districts maps) affected by CSO spills were included. Furthermore,
assumptions of the magnitude of the impact per sector were made based on the results of the local
surveys: 50% impact to restaurants, 25% to retails and 25% to maritime sector (water sport and private
fishing). The daily economic impact obtained by dividing the value added by the number of days of
the bathing season, was finally multiplied by the average number of sea water pollution days (where
the beaches could potentially be closed to bathing) to estimate the potential annual indirect damages
to the coastal economy.
The different GI systems were simulated in both the 1D and the 1D/2D drainage models by
converting the planned GI areas from impervious areas into pervious areas with hydrological losses.
This simplified approach was also used by Velasco et al. [4]. However, to the knowledge of the authors,
this method was not validated with hydrological data and can be a limitation.
The direct damages produced by CSO spills to receiving water bodies were calculated using a
reparation cost method, which assumes that the value of the damage is equal to the cost of repairing
it [34]. The direct damage produced by CSO spills was obtained multiplying the average annual
CSO volume by the unit CSO damage cost of 0.7 €/m3 in Badalona. Instead, in the case of Barcelona
different values were used: 2.69 €/m3 for CSOs to the sea and 1.50 €/m3 to the river and the harbor
according to a Spanish regional normative devised for industrial spills [35]. Another benefit considered
was the reduction of the sewage water to be treated by the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
The monetization of this benefit was calculated as the avoided costs of combined sewer water treatment
that were estimated by multiplying the average treated annual volumes from the urban drainage
model with a selected unit treatment cost of 0.12 €/m3 that is considered reasonable for local WWTPs
based on local expertise. The tangible indirect damages (and the consequent benefits calculated as
avoided damages) to coastal economies were estimated using the pollution time from the sea water
quality model and the coastal economy model explained before.
The additional indirect benefits considered are based on four contributions. The first is aesthetic
value which is monetized as the willingness to pay for properties nearby, or that include green
infrastructure, is measured through the increase of the value of these properties. This value could also
include the increased property taxes acquired by the taxation authorities [8]. In this case, the benefits
were estimated with a benefit transfer method to be the 3% of the CAPEX of GI [22]. The benefits
derived from the reduction of energetic consumption (for indoor heating and cooling) and heat island
effect are quantified using 0.049 €/m2/y per green roof unit surface [24]. Benefits derived from urban
heat island reduction obtained with bioretention cells (that in Barcelona are planned) were not included
and this can be a limitation. The air quality benefits are derived from both emission reduction (of
CO2 and Nox) capacity of GI that was estimated to be 0.072 ton/ha and the cost of emissions of
3051 €/ton [24,36]. The habitat provision was based on the potential increase of urban ecosystems that
support wildlife and it was estimated to be 2.8 €/m2 for both case studies. This was estimated using a
benefit transfer method from a study that assumed the value of habitat creation could be estimated at
15% of the value of natural land [22].

3. Results
3.1. Costs
Table 1 summarizes CAPEX and OPEX of the green infrastructure proposed in Badalona and
Barcelona. The table shows that in the case of Badalona the total costs are approximately an order of
magnitude lower compared to Barcelona. Barcelona has a bigger area and a much more ambitious
implementation plan compared to Badalona. Further, the total GI costs of Badalona are dominated by
green roofs. This is because green roofs are assumed to be retrofitted onto 5% of the total roof area of
Badalona, whereas infiltration trenches are placed only on 7 different parks and infiltration pavements
on 5 different parks and public squares.

3.2. Benefits
The first step in order to estimate benefits derived from flood damage reduction obtained by
GI implementation is the estimation of EAD for both the BAU and the GI scenarios. Table 2 shows
the EAD results. Generally, the EAD of these two BAU scenarios are considered to be overestimated,
particularly in the case of Barcelona (see the Discussion section). Figure 3 shows the flood damage
costs simulated as a function of different exceedance probabilities for the two case studies. The EAD
that is the area below the curve of Figure 3 was calculated using simple trapezoidal contributions
adopting the linear interpolation between the discrete points represented Figure 3.

share in Barcelona compared to Badalona. This is probably because of the widespread GI 
implementation of Barcelona compared to Badalona where a significantly less ambitious GI 
implementation plan was considered. A different GI location in Badalona could result in higher water 
related benefits. Cooper et al. [9] also looked into the contribution of multiple benefits associated to 
green infrastructure (considered as a coastal flood adaptation measure) showing that benefits from 
reduced residential damages were 69% of the total, recreational and health benefits 12% and avoided 
commercial damages 12%.

Figure 6. Discounted (i = 1.23%) costs and benefits of gree infrastr cture. ( ) Barcelo a and

The evaluation period T in this study was selected to be 80 years in both cases. Similar studies
performing CBA for climate change adaptation measures in the context of urban drainage pla ning
used 90 years [23]; 50 years [7] and 35 years [4].
Figure 7 shows the discounted marginal benefits during the project evaluation period.
Both Barcelona and B dalona and two different di count r tes (1.23% and 4%) were applied.
Additionally, three different combinations of benefits are included and shown. Fir t, only benefits
derived from flood damage reduction are included, t n flood together with water quality benefits
a d finally all benefits from the three cat gories proposed: flood, water quality and additional benefits.
Th s three different combinations show that including multiple GI benefits significantly affects the
re ults and this is relevant for decisi n making of urban drainage planning. In the ase of Barcelona,
the NPV btained c sidering only benefits derived from floo damage reducti n and a discount
rate of 1.23% (Figure 7a) increases by a factor of 1.74 when including flood and water quality benefits
and by 2.37 when including all the three benefits categories. Instead, with a discount rate of 4.00%
(Figure 7b), the NPV obtained considering only benefits derived from flood damage reduction increases
by a factor of 1.95 when including flood and water quality benefits and by 2.76 when including all the
three benefits categories. In the case of Badalona, the NPV also increases significantly by including
multiple benefits. In this case, factors of increase of NPV are considered misleading because the NPV
is mostly negative. The NPV in Badalona becomes positive only at the last five years of the study
evaluation period (Figure 7c).
In the two cases analyzed in this study two different discount rates were considered: the 1.23%
that was recommended for climate change adaptation projects in the region of Catalonia [37] where
the two considered cities are located and the 4% that was used in another CBA of climate change
adaptation measures of Barcelona [4]. The discount rate is a controversial topic in economic valuation
of policies, in particular in the context of climate change as it involves intergenerational and social
valuation issues (Atkinson et al., 2018). In addition CBA results are very sensitive to the discount rate,
particularly for projects with a long time horizon, where small changes of discount rate can influence
the suggested decisions [38]. High discount rates imply that future economic impacts would have
a lower weight compared to today’s value, and could lead to an underestimation of future benefits
derived from damage reduction measures [39,40]. A CBA of GI for the case study of Melbourne used
1.4% [7] and the range of 1 to 4% for GI Danish case studies of [3,5]. Some literature also proposed
a 1% discount rate (Aaheim, 2010; Lopez, 2008; Stern, 2007). Different public institutions propose
different discount rates. For instance, in Denmark, the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
recommended a 3% for environmental projects while the Department of Finance suggested 5% [5].
The US EPA recommended 2–3% while the American office of management and budget proposed
7% [5]. For developing countries the World Bank recommend 10% because of the significant GDP
growth [38,41]. The UK Government proposed 3.5% for project evaluation periods of 1–30 years, 3%
Sustainability 2020, 12, 3792 14 of 18
for 31–75 years, 2.5% for 76–125 years, 2% for 125–200 years, 1.5% for 201–300 years and 1% for larger
periods [42]. Generally, it is recommendable to consider different discount rates in order to quantify
favorable and unfavorable scenarios.

fi t different discount rates. (a) Barcelona with i = . ; )
= 4. 0%; (c) Badalona with i = 1.23%; (d) B dalona with i = 4.00%.
The cumulative NPV including all benefits in Barcelona becomes positive after 10 years wit a
discount rate of 1.23% (Figure 7a) d after 11 years with a discount rate f 4.0% (Figure 7b). In Badalona
it becomes positive after 75 years with a discount rate of 1.23% (Figure 7c) and it remains neg tive
with a discount rate of .0% (Figure 7d). Over ll, the GI pl nning scenari of Barcelona seems to be a
better socio-economical ption comp red to inaction. Instead, th GI pl nning s enario in Badalona
seems t b a worse socio-economical option compar d to i action. Similarly, Zhou et al. [5] presented
several stormwater infiltration scenarios th t can be considered as GI scenarios showing positive
NPV at discount rates of 1% and both positive and negative NPV at discount rates of both 3 and
5%. Zhou et al. [23] pres nte a negative 50th percentile of the NPV of their stormwate infiltration
adaptation scenario. Alves et al. [6] obtained negative NPV for both a green roof and a p meable
pavements adaptation scenario and a positive NPV for rainwater harvesting. Zhou et al. [3] report d a
positive NPV for th ir stormwater infiltration scenari .

4. Discussion
This study presented a CBA to evaluate the socio-economic viability of selected GI applied to
two different case studies: Barcelona and Badalona. The results are significantly different among
the two cases: Barcelona has higher NPV compared to Badalona. Additionally, the accumulated
marginal benefits (Figure 7) of Barcelona are mostly positive and become positive after tens of years
compared to Badalona where they are mostly negative during the 80 years project evaluation period.
The dominating GI benefits (Figure 4) in Barcelona are from flood damage reduction while in Badalona
from additional benefits (mostly aesthetic and habitat provision). Direct comparison between the
two case studies is difficult for several reasons: the scale difference (Barcelona is much bigger than
Badalona), the current situation (Barcelona has much higher flood damage costs than Badalona),
the different approaches used to derive CF and the differences of GI planning (Barcelona has an
intensive GI implementation plan while Badalona has a sparse one). The fact of having a sparse
implementation plan that was not devised to solve particular urban water problems might result in the
lower socio-economic performance of the case of Badalona compared to Barcelona. Further comparison
between the results obtained in Badalona and Barcelona is considered out of the scope of this study.
Generally, CBA are sensitive to parameter uncertainty and model assumptions. Therefore,
quantifying uncertainty of NPV estimations of climate change adaptation options is relevant and in
this study only uncertainty related to discount rate was addressed as also done in other studies [9].
Uncertainty is often quantified by analyzing different present and future climate scenarios [4,5,7] and
by analyzing different investment options [3]. Zhou et al. [23], instead of using a scenario approach
where variables are changed individually, quantified the NPV uncertaint
