Page 6 of 80  Executive Summary Local governments along Monterey Bay’s shores are undertaking a number of initiatives for which sea level rise adaptation planning is required. Governor Schwarzenegger’s 2008 Executive Order S-13-08 and the 2011 Resolution of the California Ocean Protection Council on sea level rise led to the proliferation of individual agency guidance documents (e.g., CalTrans (2011), BCDC (2011), CCC (2015)) that require emerging best available science (e.g., Pacific Institute Report (Heberger et al. 2009), NRC Report (2012)). These guidance documents stipulate that sea level rise and coastal hazards need to be considered in planning (e.g., Climate Action Compact, Climate Action Plans, Integrated Regional Water Management Plans, Local Hazard Mitigation Plans, Local Coastal Programs). Moreover, the California Coastal Commission has recently issued guidance indicating that sea level rise adaptation planning will be a critical piece of Local Coastal Programs going forward. As Ocean Protection Council (OPC)/California Coastal Commission (CCC) Local Coastal Program Update grantees, Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties serve as important pilots for the rest of California’s coastal communities as the state moves toward climate-ready planning.   For years, scientists have emphasized the need to put detailed, dynamic inundation information in the hands of decision-makers in order to support this planning. This information should characterize the physical risk of sea level rise and storms in order to inform coastal managers. Detailed economic analysis, while not completely absent, has lagged behind. Many past studies have focused on the cost of sea level rise, or in some cases estimated the economic benefits of a single adaptation strategy (armoring).1   The southern Monterey Bay shore is, on average, the most erosive sandy shore in California (Hapke et al. 2006). The purpose of this study is to provide decision makers in the region with the tools they need to compare a suite of possible adaptation strategies to combat accelerating coastal erosion for their coastline. The physical process modeling projects how the coast would change in response to the implementation of each of these strategies, considering different rates of coastal erosion and flood hazards as well as sea level rise under several different sea level rise projections. This study also analyzes the economic costs and benefits of each                                                      1 A small number of studies have examined the costs of sea level rise (SLR) in California specifically. Heberger (2009) found that $100 billion in California property is at risk of inundation from a 1.4-m increase in sea level.  King et al. (2015) combine data on the recreational value of beaches with estimates of property/infrastructure losses in several California coastal cities in order to examine optimal SLR adaptation strategies.  Ng and Mendelsohn (2005) estimated the tradeoff between coastal “protection” (armoring) and “inundation” (doing nothing) in Singapore and determined that armoring was the most effective approach. Hallegatte et al. (2011) examined potential insurance losses and reductions in economic output caused by SLR in Copenhagen. They found that adapting to sea level rise is far more cost-effective than doing nothing. However, their adaptation strategies focused on traditional “hard” armoring methods.  Page 7 of 80  adaptation approach, allowing decision makers to compare how the different management strategies will impact their jurisdiction economically as well as physically. This study provides a detailed, integrated analysis of the costs and benefits of a range of coastal climate change adaptation strategies at four reaches in southern Monterey Bay (Figure 1), given a range of sea level rise projections. We consider a wide range of costs and benefits including losses to private property, to public goods such as recreational resources, and to the ecological function of coastal habitats. With extensive stakeholder input, we chose realistic alternative shoreline management strategies specific to discrete reaches of coastline in the study area. By combining projections of coastal hazard impacts (such as sea level rise, erosion, storm surge, wave impacts, etc.) with economic analyses of the impact on both at-risk human-made infrastructure (buildings, roads, etc.) and natural capital (ecological function and recreational assets), we estimated the value of various adaptation approaches for each reach. This information will give coastal managers the information they need to compare the benefits and impacts of different adaptation approaches and develop adaptation plans for their jurisdictions.  Figure 1: Study area divided in reaches based on geomorphology Previous economic assessment of shoreline management strategies in Monterey Bay (ESA PWA 2012) examined various erosion-control alternatives using three of the same reaches as this study (this study added Moss Landing) and found that armoring strategies were generally not cost-effective. In Ventura County, a recent study reached similar conclusions: proactive adaptation yields more benefits than costs, and the degree to which a nature-based adaptation strategy becomes more economically preferable to a shoreline armoring strategy depends largely upon how much the community values its natural resources and the ecological services they provide to the community (Environ & ESA PWA 2015). Page 8 of 80  At the outset of this project, stakeholder input was used to define the scenarios and adaptation strategies that would be included in the analysis; agreed-upon strategies for analysis are listed in Table 1 below (See Table 11 for additional information about upland land use strategies).  Table 1: Adaptation management strategies modeled for each shoreline reach Reach Management Strategy Del Monte Opportunistic/scheduled beach Nourishment: smaller local beach nourishment projects scheduled every 10 years Shoreline Armoring: Revetment constructed continuously across reach along backshore; stops erosion of back shore but allows beach to narrow and the structure to be overtopped Managed Retreat (Fee Simple Acquisition): erosion continues unimpeded; property purchased at fair market value Medium scale Nourishment as Needed with Groins: groins installed, beach nourished to 25% wider than current (2010) conditions Elevating Structures Sand City Large scale Nourishment as Needed: large scale nourishment needed to maintain 25% wider beach Managed Retreat (Conservation Easements): easements are acquired to allow erosion of upland property Shoreline Armoring: Revetment constructed continuously across reach along backshore; stops erosion of back shore but allows beach to narrow and the structure to be overtopped Elevating Infrastructure: HWY 1 elevated to column-supported causeway Marina Rolling Easements: allows erosion to continue naturally; coastal property boundaries move landward with high water lines Managed Retreat (Fee Simple Acquisition): erosion continues unimpeded; property purchased at fair market value Shoreline Armoring: Revetment constructed continuously across reach along backshore;  stops erosion of back shore but allows beach to narrow and the structure to be overtopped Moss Landing  Do nothing: erosion Shoreline Armoring: Revetment constructed continuously across reach along backshore; stops erosion of back shore but allows beach to narrow and the structure to be overtopped; rough estimate for estuarine / harbor water level management (e.g. lock) Managed Retreat (Conservation Easements): easements are acquired to allow erosion of upland property Page 9 of 80  In order to determine the costs and benefits of each strategy for each reach, we first examined the physical impact of these strategies. We modeled expected shoreline changes for each proposed adaptation strategy under a range of sea level rise projections (using the High and Medium projections recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 2013)) and time horizons (2010, 2030, 2060 and 2100). We analyzed data sets and previous models to project the dynamics of beach erosion, beach nourishment, and other physical processes. The economic costs of each strategy were estimated by gathering information on the engineering costs of sand placement, construction of groins, and implementation of the various adaptation measures. These results were coupled with an economic analysis of the recreational and ecological value of coastal and upland resources that could be affected by coastal hazards. This part of the analysis involved conducting coastal user surveys to determine the value of beach and coastal recreation. We ranked the relative ecological condition of the beach within the study area using several metrics to score the physical, biotic, and human impacts conditions of km2 blocks of Monterey beaches. The resulting beach ecological index score was then combined with estimates of beach restoration (replacement) costs to provide a monetized ecological value. In all, more than 100 distinct scenarios were analyzed.  We combined the estimates for all these costs and benefits and expressed them in terms of net present value using a 1% discount rate, which is appropriate for long-term climate change modeling.  Results were expressed as net present value of the shoreline.   In all cases the least economically beneficial alternative, especially over the long-term, involved shoreline armoring.   For example, results for the Del Monte reach are shown in Figure 2 below. “Net Present Value” refers to the sum of all the benefits (e.g., the recreational and ecological value of beaches) minus the costs (e.g., engineering costs of armoring and nourishment). Loss of land, buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, as well as the cost of adaptation (e.g., elevating roads), were incorporated as costs in the analysis.   Page 10 of 80   Figure 2: Economic benefits of adaptation approaches for the Del Monte reach For all time horizons, the Scheduled Nourishment option, which involves smaller local beach nourishment projects scheduled every 10 years, results in the highest net present value (NPV). Our results indicate that, in some cases, Nourishment may be the most cost effective option, depending on the value of the coastal infrastructure at risk as well as the value that the community places on those at-risk assets.  In the Del Monte reach (Figure 2), Scheduled Nourishment has a slightly higher net NPV.  However, this outcome depends crucially on the availability of sand and the assumptions employed.  The Allow Erosion and Beach Nourishment alternatives yield NPVs that are very close and well within the margin of error.  Under different sets of plausible assumptions, as when nourishment costs increase, Allow Erosion yields a higher NPV than Nourishment. Given this margin of error, it is most accurate to state that Nourishment and Allow Erosion result in NPVs that are statistically indistinguishable.    For 2030, the NPVs of Allow Erosion and Scheduled Beach Nourishment are within 2% of each other, which is well within the margin of error.  For the 2060 and 2100 time horizons, both nourishment options offer the most economic benefits.  In all time frames except 2030, Shoreline Armoring is the worst option.   For the Sand City reach, the adaptation scenarios we considered were to Allow Erosion through Conservation Easements and Elevating Infrastructure, to Nourish as Needed (nourish the beaches based on a trigger point when the beach hits a particular width), and Shoreline Armoring (building a revetment across the entire reach). In all scenarios, Allowing Erosion – and particularly the implementation of Conservation Easements – resulted in the greatest net $0$50$100$150$200$250ScheduledNourishNourish w/GroinsAllow Erosion ShorelineHardening2030 (22 cm) $48,100,000 $10,600,000 $47,300,000 $15,000,0002060 (72 cm) $128,600,000 $72,400,000 $122,100,000 $43,900,0002100 (159 cm) $214,500,000 $188,700,000 $165,000,000 $26,400,000Millions Page 11 of 80  present value, while Shoreline Armoring yielded negative benefits, meaning it would cost more to build the revetment than the sum of the benefits the revetment would provide.   For the Marina reach, the adaptation scenarios we considered were to Allow Erosion in conjunction with Fee Simple Property Acquisition or Rolling Easements, and Shoreline Armoring. Allowing Erosion yields significant benefits, while Shoreline Armoring, again, costs more than it is worth in all scenarios. Both Fee Simple Property Acquisition and Rolling Easements yield significant benefits in all time horizons considered.   For the Moss Landing reach, the adaptation scenarios we analyzed were to Allow Erosion – either by taking No Action and letting nature run its course or through Conservation Easements – and Shoreline Armoring. In all time frames considered, Allow Erosion had a significantly higher net present value than Shoreline Armoring, meaning the costs of building and maintaining the revetments are greater than the benefits they provide. Investing in Conservation Easements yields significantly greater benefits than Doing Nothing.  As with any economic modeling, results are based on certain assumptions.  To understand the relative role of each of these assumptions in our analysis, we conducted a sensitivity analysis—running the model using a range of values for key parameters to determine how sensitive the model is to changes in that parameter.  We focused on the parameters that we believed were the most uncertain or where experts could disagree.  In most cases, we found that our results were quite robust.  The exception was in the Del Monte reach, where the two Beach Nourishment options and Allow Erosion are close enough that the assumptions matter.  This analysis is meant to provide coastal managers and decision makers in the region with general guidelines for assessing various adaptation options for sea level rise and coastal hazard mitigation.  These methods and data can help inform coastal adaptation efforts, including Local Coastal Program sea level rise updates, coastal development permitting, and even regional and parcel level coastal protection, restoration, and development opportunities. Further, our results highlight how commonplace approaches to shoreline protection (i.e., shoreline armoring) are often not the most economically or environmentally sound choices. Our results call into question the conventional wisdom that shoreline armoring is the best response to coastal erosion.  In most scenarios analyzed, shoreline armoring yielded significantly lower net present values (NPVs) than other options.  While southern Monterey Bay is not representative of the entire California coast, some extrapolation of results is possible. For example, even in the more urbanized Del Monte reach, which includes parts of Page 12 of 80  the City of Monterey, our analysis indicates that armoring yields significantly lower NPVs; this result could be applicable to other urbanized stretches of the California coastline with similar levels of exposure to coastal hazards.     Page 13 of 80  Economic Impacts of Climate Adaptation Strategies for Southern Monterey Bay Introduction Sea level rise resulting from human-induced climate change is a serious problem for many coastal communities throughout the world. Today, 600 million people live within ten miles of an ocean coast and three-quarters of the world’s megacities are at sea level (Tebaldi et al. 2012).  The synthesis report for the fifth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2013) concluded that:  “… human influence on the climate system is clear and growing, with impacts observed across all continents and oceans. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The IPCC is now 95 percent certain that humans are the main cause of current global warming. In addition, the [synthesis report] finds that the more human activities disrupt the climate, the greater the risks of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems, and long-lasting changes in all components of the climate system. “ (emphasis added) Coastal Climate Change Adaptation in California Adaptation to the changes that sea level rise will bring to coastal communities is critical, and the State of California has been a leader in this arena, making substantial progress in promoting sea level rise science and adaptation.  The California Coastal Commission has provided very specific guidance on how communities should plan and adapt (August 2015 California Coastal Commission Sea Level Rise Guidance), and several state agencies have policies that guide their own activities in the face of sea level rise.  The Ocean Protection Council, the California Coastal Commission, and the State Coastal Conservancy are granting funding support for vulnerability assessments, Local Coastal Program updates to incorporate consideration of sea level rise, and other activities targeted at developing climate readiness. As a result, a growing number of coastal communities now have access to high-resolution vulnerability information that can provide a strong foundation for their adaptation planning. Among the most significant issues driving coastal management and policy in the face of sea level rise is the need to protect private property.  Sea level rise and associated flooding will threaten nearly $100 billion worth of property along the California coast by 2100 (Heberger et al. 2009), and coastal landowners and planners will inevitably act to protect their assets from these losses. Landowners overwhelmingly default to standard risk-mitigation techniques to sea level rise-induced problems – specifically, coastal armoring solutions (seawalls, revetments, Page 14 of 80  dikes, and levees). While armoring may be the right choice in some locations, it has well-documented adverse consequences, many of which are incompatible with maintaining a natural beach system that supports the local tourism economy and coastal ecosystem. On a natural shore, beach width is generally maintained as the shore erodes. However, when structures are built on an eroding shore, passive erosion occurs in which the beach in front of the structure becomes drowned over time as the adjacent shore continues to erode. This results in the structure projecting out into the ocean like a peninsula, which blocks lateral (alongshore) beach access and increases the exposure of the structure to wave impacts and overtopping. The before and after photographs of Stillwell Hall in Figure 3 illustrate this issue and the potential for beach recovery following the removal of such a structure. Nature-based strategies that enhance the natural flood mitigation benefits of coastal ecosystems could be an effective alternative, avoiding the adverse consequences of coastal armoring.  However, few California jurisdictions have policies that prioritize nature-based strategies, and individual property owners rarely choose them. Building upon an existing body of work A substantial body of research and policy thought has already been dedicated to considering erosion mitigation alternatives for southern Monterey Bay; this study builds and improves on those previous projects.   Managers in the southern Monterey Bay region recognized that coastal assets were experiencing unusually high rates of erosion, and worked with partners at the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments, and the California Coastal Sediment Management Workgroup to form the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Erosion Workgroup to address these issues collaboratively.  In 2008, PWA (now ESA (Environmental Science Associates)) completed a Coastal Regional Sediment Management Plan (CRSMP) for Southern Monterey Bay for the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG) and the Coastal Sediment Management Workgroup.  The CRSMP for southern Monterey Bay recommended additional research into beach restoration and protection strategies  to decrease the severe erosion within the region.  In 2012, ESA PWA (now ESA (Environmental Science Associates)) conducted an “Evaluation of Erosion Mitigation Alternatives for Southern Monterey Bay” in response to recommendations in the CRSMP for the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation and the Southern Monterey Bay Coastal Erosion Working Group. This study provided an assessment of various erosion mitigation measures to support development of a regional strategy to address coastal erosion Page 15 of 80  hazards in southern Monterey Bay. Through a technical evaluation of various erosion mitigation measures, a cost benefit analysis was performed for a number of adaptation measures, and recommendations were made on subregional approaches for effectively addressing coastal erosion in the study area.   This study expands upon and extends this previous work in Monterey Bay in several ways:  1. we collected primary data on beach/coastal attendance and recreation;  2. we collected data on the ecological functions, goods and services of the beaches and coastal ecosystems in the study area;  3. our analysis of property boundary data – or parcel data – has been updated and fact-checked to ensure accuracy;  4. we examined the feasibility and cost of beach nourishment in great detail based on new data on sand availability and grain sizes; and 5. our analysis includes detailed consideration of sea level rise and coastal hazards, data which was not available for incorporation into previous studies.    The coastal hazards mapped in this study vary with time and include increased flooding and erosion due to sea level rise, in addition to accounting for beach width, backshore erosion, sand grain size, and sand volume changes. These improved mapping methods were applied to the study area in the Monterey Bay Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Study (MBSLR), which developed baseline coastal erosion and flooding hazard zones to understand the implications of sea level rise under a no-action scenario (ESA PWA 2014)2. MBSLR considers the hazards of wave run-up, overtopping, and coastal inundation that were not included in the Erosion Mitigation Alternatives study. Building on the MBSLR hazard modeling methods, and the introduction of an articulated beach width model, this analysis develops a suite of coastal hazards that considers future sea level rise and examines different adaptation strategies, enabling a more complete assessment of the costs and benefits associated with each strategy.                                                       2 MBSLR Baseline coastal hazard maps can be viewed by visiting The Nature Conservancy website: http://maps.coastalresilience.org/california/#, selecting the Monterey geography, and opening the Flood and Sea Level Rise layer menu on the left panel. The technical methods report (ESA PWA 2014) can be viewed through the “View Technical Report” link at the bottom of the Flood and Sea Level Rise layer menu. Page 16 of 80  Stakeholder Engagement for this analysis Stakeholder engagement is a critical step in coastal adaptation planning. At the outset of this project, The Nature Conservancy (TNC) worked in coordination with a project team consisting of coastal ecologists, economists, engineers, and geomorphologists, as well as with key adaptation partners in the region to identify key stakeholders and decision-makers. Stakeholders were invited to a one-day workshop at the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve on June 26, 2014.  The primary objective of the workshop was to solicit stakeholder and local decision maker involvement in the identification of the sea level rise adaptation strategies to be considered in this analysis. Presentations from the project team on physical modeling and economic methodology prompted a lively and productive question and answer session with stakeholders; feedback from the discussion was used in refining the methodological approaches later used in the analysis. Workshop participants were then asked to note areas, assets, and issues of particular concern on large maps of the study area illustrating sea level rise and coastal hazard flooding projections for 2100. This information was collected and added to the Coastal Resilience Monterey web tool (http://maps.coastalresilience.org/california/#) within the Map Layers application. These priority assets were also taken into consideration in the economic analysis.  Based on the “Erosion Mitigation Alternatives for Southern Monterey Bay” study, which identified and ranked the most feasible management strategies for each stretch of shoreline, the study area was divided into four reaches (see Figure 1) based on similar geomorphological characteristics and with consideration of political boundaries. Workshop attendees separated into small groups, each focusing on one of the four shoreline reaches.  Each group was given several strategies to consider with the goal of selecting three to five coastal climate adaptation strategies to be modeled and analyzed for each of the four reaches. To facilitate this discussion, the Project Team presented an overview of the most commonly considered adaptation strategies, explicitly weighing the documented advantages and disadvantages of each.   Several key stakeholders were unable to attend the workshop, so members of the Project Team (principally The Nature Conservancy’s staff) met with these stakeholders in person throughout September and October 2014.  With robust stakeholder input, the final suite of adaptation strategies was selected. In order to model the scenarios, we then detailed how each of the strategies would be applied, as realistically as possible based on historical management practices (see Table 1).  In autumn of 2015, the Project Team was invited to present preliminary results at a meeting of the Association of Monterey Bay Area Governments (AMBAG). On January 9, 2016, TNC and Page 17 of 80  several members of the Project Team presented the results to the Technical Advisory Committee for the Coastal Hazards Vulnerability Assessment, currently being undertaken by Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties, which includes many of the original project stakeholders.    2003       2015 Figure 3: Stillwell Hall before and after removal of armoring and building in 2004 photo credit: Copyright © 2013 Kenneth & Gabrielle Adelman, California Coastal Records Project, www.californiacoastline.org Modeling Shoreline Changes resulting from Adaptation Scenarios As threats to coastal development have increased, so has the pressure to protect coastal property with various types of coastal armoring such as seawalls and revetments. In response to this, and as part of its revised management plan, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS) developed the Coastal Armoring Action Plan. The goal of this action plan is to minimize additional armoring in the coastal areas near the MBNMS through proactive The southern Monterey Bay shore is on average the most erosive sandy shore in California (Hapke et al. 2006). Although only a very small proportion of the shore is armored at this time, there are several examples of passive erosion occurring, associated with the rip-rap seawall fronting Stillwell Hall in Fort Ord (since removed, see Figure 3) and the rip-rap at the end of Tioga Avenue in Sand City. In addition, shore access is currently blocked at high tide at the Monterey Beach Resort and the Ocean Harbor House condominiums seawalls during the winter when the beach is seasonally reduced. This situation is expected to worsen due to continued erosion, and increased erosion rates attributed to sea level rise. The existing seawalls will eventually project into the ocean as the sea level rises, subsuming beach habitat and blocking recreational access (Figure 3). This anticipated loss of the beach in southern Monterey Bay is a prime example of the need for better alternatives to traditional engineering structures that aim to preserve recreational and ecological resources, as well as protect upland property and infrastructure.

The Coastal Armoring Action Plan recommends developing a more proactive and comprehensive regional approach that minimizes the negative impacts of coastal armoring on a sanctuary-wide basis (MBNMS 2008).   Our analysis supports that recommendation by applying improved methods to model the response of beach width, coastal erosion and storm event hazards through time under a range of sea level rise projections and various adaptation scenarios chosen with stakeholder input, as described above. A model that analyzes the coupled impact of sea level rise and coastal flooding hazards is essential in order to fully understand the potential range of future impacts, while the incorporation of beach width modeling improves our estimates of the recreational and ecological value lost or gained and the future implications of different adaptation strategies.   Coastal Hazards Four separate hazard categories were analyzed: chronic erosion, chronic flooding, event wave impacts, and event flooding. Erosion was estimated in tandem with a beach width model that tracked erosion of the shoreline and backshore through time and adjusted erosion rates based on the existing beach buffer and actions of each adaptation scenario. These physical processes and the modeling approaches used are briefly discussed below, while more detailed methods can be found in Appendix A. Chronic Erosion Chronic erosion, or long-term erosion due to sea level rise (not taking into account erosion from a large storm), results in a loss of property and infrastructure seaward of the eroded dune location. We used baseline erosion results from the ESA PWA 2014 study as input into a two-line model that tracks movement of both the shoreline and backshore. The distance between these two reference features is the beach width. Erosion of the backshore is mapped in GIS as a buffer from the current backshore location, representing the future dune crest for the year mapped. Chronic Flooding Chronic flooding hazard zones are areas that will be regularly flooded (once per month, on average) by high tides under future sea level rise, not considering storm events, erosion, or river discharge.  Two types of chronic flooding datasets were developed: extent of inundation and depth. The depth grids were used by the economists to determine the damage to properties from chronic flooding, using standard depth/damage curves from USACE. The Page 19 of 80  elevation of inundation chosen for chronic flooding was Extreme Monthly High Water (EMHW), calculated by averaging the maximum monthly water level for every month recorded at the Monterey Bay tide gauge (EMHW = 2.0 meters (6.5 feet) NAVD88) over the most recent tidal epoch. Sea level rise projections were added to the EMHW for each sea level rise and planning horizon and mapped over the terrain. Chronic erosion areas have been erased from chronic flood zones so as not to double-count damages. Event Wave Impacts The event wave zone is where water could rush inland due to waves breaking at the coast, damaging structures, moving cars, etc. This zone takes into account both erosion and inland extent of wave run-up during a large coastal storm. In addition to chronic coastal erosion hazards, wave induced impacts of storm erosion and coastal flooding from a 100-year coastal storm wave event were mapped, using results from the Monterey Bay Sea Level Rise Vulnerability (MBSLR) study as a baseline. Reach-averaged storm erosion distances were calculated and then modified to reflect the impacts of the various adaptation strategies on the beach width zones. Throughout the analysis, beach widths varied based on the proposed adaptation management scenario; for example, some of the beach nourishment scenarios include beach widths that are narrower or wider than existing beach widths.  Storm erosion impacts respond to the changes in beach widths, with the beach essentially reducing storm erosion of the backshore and dune. If the beach is wider than it was under existing conditions, the storm erosion distance is smaller and vice versa. Wave run-up distances were calculated for the various adaptation scenarios by modifying the run-up distance with beach width. Similar to storm erosion distance, the inland extent of run-up was reduced if the beach widened and increased if the beach narrowed. Detailed explanations of the event wave impact methods can be found in Appendix A. Event Flooding Similar to storm wave event impacts, flooding due to a 100-year coastal storm event was calculated and mapped for each adaptation scenario. The modeling results from MBSLR were used as the baseline, with wave overtopping and 100-year tidal inundation being the dominant flood types along the southern Monterey Bay coastline. Processes considered included storm surge, wave overtopping (waves running up and over the beach and flooding low-lying areas), extreme lagoon water levels in the Salinas River, and additional flooding caused by future rising sea level. The dominant hazard type changes with differences in shoreline morphology. Wave overtopping was used as the dominant type in places where low-lying areas are separated from the ocean by dunes, coastal armoring structures, or other obstructions. The 100-year tide water level (2.48 m NAVD88) was assumed to be the dominant flood type in predominantly open tidal Page 20 of 80  systems (e.g., Elkhorn Slough) and was then raised by sea level for future planning horizons. More information on the modeling methods for event flooding impacts can be found in Appendix A. Beach Width Zones A quantitative model was developed to track shoreline location, backshore location and beach width through time in response to sea level rise and adaptation scenario. The beach width is the distance between the shoreline3 and the backshore. A starting beach width was estimated for each reach by taking the average distance between the mean high water line4 and the backshore location as observed in the 2009 - 2011 California Coastal Conservancy Coastal LiDAR Project Hydro-Flattened Bare Earth DEM (collected in spring 2010 in this area). Subsequent beach widths are calculated based on the relative movement of the shoreline and backshore. If the shoreline erodes more quickly than the backshore, then the beach narrows, and vice versa. Three components contribute to shoreline movement in this quantified conceptual model: landward movement due to sea level rise, shoreline erosion caused by other coastal processes (e.g., waves, wind, changes in sediment supply), and seaward movement of the shore due to sand placement activities. The components of backshore movement are similar except that the beach nourishment adjustment (which only changes the shoreline) is replaced with a placement loss distance (which only affects the backshore when armor is constructed).  Adaptation Scenarios & Assumptions Two sea level rise scenarios, High and Medium, were examined for this study, as well as three planning horizons (2030, 2060, and 2100) consistent with MBSLR (ESA PWA 2014) and the recommendations provided to planners by the IPCC and NRC (IPCC 2013, NRC 2012).   Table 2: Sea Level Rise Projections Year Medium Sea Level Rise Projection High Sea Level Rise Projection 2030 10 cm (4 in) 22 cm (8.8 in) 2060 33 cm (12.8 in) 72 cm (28.3 in) 2100 88 cm (34.5 in) 159 cm (62.6 in)                                                      3 Assumed to be located at Mean High Water (1.455 m NAVD88, from NOAA Monterey tide gage). 4 The mean high water line was extracted from the 2009 - 2011 California Coastal Conservancy Coastal LiDAR Project Hydro-Flattened Bare Earth DEM. Page 21 of 80  Adaptation scenarios Five management scenarios, as suggested and refined by the stakeholder participation process, were considered for southern Monterey Bay. Three to five of these scenarios were assessed for each of the four study reaches (Moss Landing, Marina, Sand City, and Del Monte; see Figure 1), as summarized in Table 3 below. A scenario may combine multiple management actions to create a “hybrid” approach. Each of the potential management actions and the associated model input parameters are described below. These descriptions focus on the physical implications of each management scenario, specifically the evolution of beach width and erosion of the backshore. A detailed explanation of the methods used to calculate the various hazards resulting from each scenario can be found in Appendix A.

Baseline with beach width modeling and easement costs. Allow Erosion Page 24 of 80  Shoreline Armoring (at the backshore, aka “Hold the Line”) In this scenario, existing coastal protection infrastructure (e.g., seawalls, revetments) is maintained where it currently exists and constructed continuously across the reach where it does not yet exist; “holding the line” represents the current default coastal management approach. This scenario is modeled by assuming the backshore erosion rate is zero. A portion of the beach is converted to coastal armor, resulting in a placement loss (beach narrows initially due to the footprint of the structure). The structure is assumed to protect the area behind it from erosion hazards; however, with continued shoreline erosion and the additional impact of sea level rise, the beach in front of the structure narrows. The loss of the buffer that the beach provides to the backshore from wave action eventually leads to increased wave run-up and overtopping hazards behind the structures. The structural life of the revetment is assumed to be 30 years initially, but is reduced to 20 years once the backshore is exposed in the beach width model (no beach buffer with higher sea levels and more intense events result in higher wave loading and more rapid degradation of structures). Allow Erosion Under this management scenario, the shoreline and backshore are allowed to erode at a natural rate accelerated by sea level rise. This model was applied to scenarios of Managed Retreat, Fee Simple Acquisition, Conservation Easements, and Elevating Infrastructure, all of which allow erosion to continue. Since the dunes are permitted to erode, the beach erodes at a slower rate with backshore dunes than without them.  Beach Nourishment Beach nourishment maintains beach widths for a longer time, preserving recreational, ecological, and buffer functions in the process. The following sections describe the three types of beach nourishment scenarios selected for the two southernmost reaches in this study:  1. Beach Nourishment as Needed (in Sand City) 2. Beach Nourishment as Needed with Groins (in Del Monte) 3. Scheduled Beach Nourishment (in Del Monte)  These reaches, Del Monte and Sand City, are lower in elevation, less exposed to waves, and more developed than the other two considered in this study (Marina and Moss Landing). In general, beach nourishment frequency was chosen to mitigate increasing erosion due to sea level rise but still allow the background erosion rate to continue. In general, beach nourishment results in lower backshore erosion rates and less wave impact because the wide beach acts as a buffer. The beach nourishment scenarios are generally modeled such that the backshore Page 25 of 80  erosion by 2100 is equal to the backshore erosion that would have occurred by 2100 without sea level rise (simply from ongoing erosion). The only exception is the “scheduled beach nourishment” scenario, as described below.   We assumed that the supply of coarse beach-sized sand in southern Monterey Bay is finite; accordingly, some adjustments were made to the beach nourishment scenarios to reflect the fact that finer sand would need to be used for nourishment over time. Specifically, the use of finer sand results in: (1) increased erosion from sea level rise due to a flatter shoreface slope and (2) higher diffusion rate of placed sediment (and therefore an increase in background erosion rate). The increasing complexity of importing sand during the later time horizons caused the cost of beach nourishment used in the analysis to increase with time. See Appendix A for additional information on modeling beach nourishment.   Beach Nourishment as Needed (Sand City) Beach nourishment (as needed) is implemented in the model by moving the shoreline seaward by the sand placement width of 100 feet, which was determined based on a placed volume of 2 million cubic yards along the Sand City reach. Beach nourishments are assumed to commence at the beginning of the model and are then repeated as necessary to maintain this beach width under long term sea level rise erosion. Beach nourishment modeling methods and notes describing selection of model parameters are presented in Appendix A. Beach Nourishment as Needed with Groins (Del Monte) The beach nourishment component of this management option is treated in the same manner as described in Beach Nourishment as Needed, above but with a sand placement volume of 400,000 cubic yards for the Del Monte reach. Groins are implemented in the model by adjusting the empirical relationship between erosion rate and beach width, historic erosion rate, and ambient beach width. Groins are able to retain sand and maintain a wider beach where wave conditions are ideal. The beach reaches a new, wider equilibrium. This is implemented in the conceptual model by increasing the “ambient beach width” in the empirical relationships used, and is further described in Appendix A. It is assumed that the groins would be reconstructed as part of each beach nourishment project. Scheduled Beach Nourishment (Del Monte) Beach nourishment with a set schedule is implemented in the model by specifying a beach nourishment width and schedule. Beach nourishments are triggered at the beginning of the model and then on the specified schedule (e.g., every 10 years). Because the intent of beach nourishment is to maintain beach width and slow backshore erosion, the backshore is still allowed to erode (but at a slower rate due to the wider beach). The volume of nourishment, Page 26 of 80  50,000 cubic yards, was selected to represent a hypothetical “opportunistic” sand nourishment, in which a small amount of sand becomes available. Therefore, unlike the other beach nourishment scenarios, the driving factor in this scenario is the nourishment schedule, not maintaining a designated beach width. Beach nourishment parameters and descriptions of how these parameters were selected can be found in Appendix A.5 Adaptation Scenario Engineering Cost Estimates To enable analysis of the economic benefits of each shoreline adaptation scenario, we developed engineering cost estimates associated with the modeled coastal hazards for various management scenarios. Engineering cost estimates were prepared for: ● Unit costs associated with various shore protection measures and structural modification of roads and buildings; ● Replacement costs for Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency (MRWPCA) sewer line and pump stations; ● Construction costs for each adaptation scenario for each study reach, as defined and previously modeled. The cost estimates drew from multiple sources, for which ESA escalated the relevant costs to 2015 dollars using the published Engineering News Record cost index. Table 4 shows the escalation factors that were applied to costs for the different years of the source information.  Table 4: Cost escalation factors determined from Engineering News Record (ENR) cost index Year ENR Cost Index Escalation Factor 1996 5620 1.78 2004 7115 1.40                                                      5    These estimates do not include all possible costs, such as design, environmental review, permitting, construction administration, monitoring, property purchase and other costs. In particular, significant costs can be expected for sand mitigation fees for coastal armoring projects. Please note that in providing opinions of probable costs, we have no control over the actual costs at the time of construction. The actual cost of construction may be impacted by the availability of construction equipment and crews, and fluctuation of supply prices at the time the work is bid. Neither TNC nor its contractors make any warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy of these estimated costs.   These estimates do not consider all possible benefits including indirect, consequential, and aesthetic benefits, and contributions to community health and well-being. Estimation of benefits is less certain than construction costs. Higher confidence is afforded recreational economics, while ecological values are inherently uncertain. Neither TNC nor its contractors make any warranty, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy of these estimates.

Most erosion mitigation measures that were considered previously are still applicable to this analysis; the selected measures are shown in Table 3. Some key assumptions not listed in Table 3 are: ● Managed Retreat and Structural Adaptation measures assume that erosion processes continue unimpeded. ● Opportunistic (small) nourishment – 75,000 CY placed every 5 years. ● Shoreline armoring (building revetments) – Includes placement losses which reduce beach width at time of construction. Includes active erosion effects which accelerate beach loss when beach width narrows and wave run-up frequently reaches structure. ● (Scheduled) Large Beach Nourishment – Two million cubic yards placed every 25 years.  ● Groins –The effect of groins is modeled as a reduction in beach width loss, using the concept of sand diffusion. Groins are assumed to be rebuilt with each subsequent beach nourishment.  Prior analyses of erosion management options for the southern Monterey Bay region used constant erosion rates and considered erosion only. The new sea level rise hazard projections analyze how hazards vary with time and include increased flooding and erosion due to sea level rise, as well as account for beach width, backshore erosion, sand grain size and sand volume changes. Cost estimates for beach nourishment were also updated based on new data on sand availability and grain sizes. The unit costs in 2015 dollars for shore protection and structural modification measures are shown in Table 5. A range of values was used to convey the sensitivity of the cost evaluation to Page 28 of 80  construction costs for structural measures. We defined the High cost as 50% higher than the Low cost. With the exception of sand placements, unit costs in Table 5 include a 35% contingency. After reviewing the large sand placement cost estimate from the 2008 Regional Sediment Management plan for the same region, and considering the approach of Moffatt & Nichol (2009) of dredging from the Monterey Canyon, we updated the cost of large sand placement from the previous study to reflect the higher cost, and more realistic methods, of Moffatt & Nichol (2009). These unit costs consider use of a hopper dredge and 8-mile barge to transport sand from the Elkhorn-Salinas delta to beaches south. The sand costs in Table 5 are for the 2010-2030 time horizons and are escalated in future horizons to reflect increasing cost of sand, as described in the Adaptation Scenario Engineering Cost Estimates section above. The High costs were used to develop the engineering cost estimates.
