To ensure the technical and economic feasibility of  13 new technology, a sound understanding of the characteristics of the integrated energy system is 14 essential. In this work, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of a waste to power and heat plant 15 based on integrated intermediate pyrolysis and CHP (Pyro-CHP) system was performed. The overall 16 plant CHP efficiency was found to be nearly 60% defined as heat and power output compared to 17 feedstock fuel input. By using an established economic evaluation model, the capital investment of a 18 5 tonne per hour plant was calculated to be £27.64 million and the Levelised Cost of Electricity was 19 £0.063/kWh. This agrees the range of cost given by the UK government. To maximise project 20 viability, technology developers should endeavour to seek ways to reduce the energy production 21 cost. Particular attention should be given to the factors with the greatest influence on the 22 profitability, such as feedstock cost (or gate fee for waste), maintaining plant availability, improving 23 energy productivity and reducing capital cost.  24  25 2   26 KEYWORDS:  27 Municipal Solid Waste (MSW); Energy from Waste (EfW); Combined Heat and Power (CHP); 28 Intermediate Pyrolysis; Techno-economic Analysis 29  30 ABBREVIATIONS 31  32 ACC Annual Cost of Capital ACT Advanced Conversion Technology CCL  Climate Change Levy CHP Combined Heat and Power COD Chemical Oxygen Demand DPC Direct Plant Cost EC Equipment Cost EfW Energy from Waste IPC Installed Plant Cost IRR Internal Rate of Return LCOE Levelised Cost of Electricity  MSW Municipal Solid Waste NPV Net Present Value OP Operating Cost RDF Refused Derived Fuel RO Renewables Obligation ROC Renewables Obligation Certificate TPC Total Plant Cost   33 3  1. Introduction 34  35 Municipal solid waste (MSW) consists mainly of household black bin waste, which is typically 36 treated or disposed of by waste treatment plants on behalf of local authorities in various ways. Over 37 the past twenty years, the focal point of UK waste management has shifted from disposal to 38 recycling or recovery, which has led to a significant reduction in the quantity of MSW sent to 39 landfill. In 2016, a total of 9.96 million tonnes of the organic fraction of solid waste and refuse 40 derived fuel (RDF) was processed at UK Energy-from-Waste (EfW) facilities, which generated a 41 total of 6.15 GWh electrical power but the amount of heat was not reported [1]. As shown in Figure 42 1, the input to EfW plants increased by 18% in 2016 compared to the previous year and nearly twice 43 the amount as a decade ago. Meanwhile, in 2016 total EfW power production increased by 2.5 times 44 the equivalent number in 2006. This is due to the increase in generation efficiency over the past ten 45 years. A forecast based on analysis of past data indicates that the levels of EfW input and power 46 production in 2026 could increase by 1.7 and 1.9 times respectively compared to 2016 values, 47 suggesting further improvements in efficiency. According to the statistics from WasteDataFlow (a 48 web-based system for municipal waste data reporting by UK local authorities to the government), 49 over 85% of the UK EfW inputs are derived from local authority collected waste with up to 15% is 50 from commercial and industrial waste [1,2]. 51  52 With over 130 year’s history, direct combustion/incineration has been the most widely employed 53 technology in waste management and the energy recovery industry. A modern incineration system 54 can process kilo tonnes per day that combust all the organic fraction in the MSW feedstock to raise 55 steam for large-scale steam turbine generators; however, the overall electrical efficiency of the plant 56 is typically around 20% [3,4]. Following increasing concerns over environmental issues and strong 57 4  growth in the future EfW market, it is increasingly important that more efficient and flexible 58 technologies with high standards of emission control are developed. 59  60  61 Figure 1. Industrial development of Energy from Waste in the UK 62  63 Alternative thermal EfW processes proposed by researchers frequently involve advanced conversion 64 technology (ACT), namely pyrolysis [4] and gasification [5]. Pyrolysis is the thermal decomposition 65 of organic materials in the absence of oxygen at elevated temperatures of around 500 °C. The 66 feedstock is converted to liquid, gaseous and solid products in varying proportions with potential in 67 biofuel applications. Gasification involves a partial combustion process at over 800 °C with the 68 controlled presence of air/oxygen, and it converts solid organics into a fuel gas containing mainly 69 CO, CH4, H2 and CO2. Industrial development and commercialisation of ACT in waste energy 70 recovery began in the 1960s. For example, the Norwegian company ENERGOS has established over 71 10 EfW plants based on gasification and steam turbine generator across Europe [6], including the Isle 72 of Wight gasification plant, which was operational from 2009 to 2017 with a processing capacity of 73 30,000 tonne MSW per year and an electrical power output of 1.8 MW [7]. The company claims the 74 plant availability can reach as high as 8000 hours per year. Nevertheless, a recent report from 75 0510152025300510152025302006 2010 2014 2018 2022 2026Total EfW Power Production (GWh)Total EfW Inputs (Million Tonne)EfW InputEfW Power Production5  UKWIN described that there has been a series of failures in the ACT based EfW projects or 76 companies due to different technical and economic issues in the plant operation [8]. 77  78 Along with industrial EfW development, there have been a number of research studies that have 79 addressed technical novelties in different aspects of the thermochemical conversion of different 80 waste materials for EfW.  These include co-processing of different types of feedstock, for example, 81 co-gasification of waste with coal [9], co-pyrolysis of waste with biomass and other wastes [10,11] 82 and application and integration of advanced technologies, for example study of thermal catalytic 83 reforming [12]  and integrations of advanced pre-treatment system [13] and plasma gasification 84 reactors [14]. For any novel energy system, a sound understanding of the technical and economic 85 performance at industrial scale is essential, as it provides key information about the project and helps 86 the project developer to identify the direction that can ensure the effort and investment are targeted at 87 the areas of most significant impact. However, not much work has been carried out in this respect. 88 Ledon et al. [15] carried out an exergo-economic analysis of a hypothetical MSW gasification 89 system integrated with a combined cycle power system in Chile. It was found that the energy loss in 90 the gasifier accounted for nearly 60% of the total energy loss.  Use of a higher gasification 91 temperature and/or lower equivalence ratio could result in better overall system performance. The 92 author claimed that the power production through the proposed process could be economically 93 viable, comparing performance to the current Chilean energy market. Salman et al. [16] performed a 94 techno-economic analysis on a new process with coupled anaerobic digestion of MSW and pyrolysis 95 of digestate that gave high-efficiency bio-methane production. In this process, char obtained from 96 pyrolysis was added to the digester as a medium for toxic chemical/micro-organism adsorption and 97 development of a stable microbial community. The pyrolysis liquid and gas produced in the 98 pyrolysis process were steam reformed into syngas and converted to bio-methane through the 99 methanation process. The economic analysis on a 23,000 tonne per year plant indicated a positive 100 6  result with a payback period of about six years. Sensitivity analysis on the project indicated the 101 change in product price is the major influencing factor for the project profitability. Luz et al. [17] 102 carried out a techno-economic analysis on MSW gasification for power generation in Brazilian 103 municipalities. Net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) were selected as 104 economic indicators for the evaluation. The technical analysis indicated that the gasification and 105 engine plant would have electricity production of between 794 and 1065kWe per tonne MSW input. 106 The authors concluded that large plants with high installed power tend to be more economically 107 viable, but without incentives from governments, such plants are unlikely to be built. Arena et al. 108 [18] evaluated the techno-economic performance of a fluidised bed gasification and steam turbine 109 system for processing mixed plastic waste (MPW) for power generation at 2-6 MW capacity. Based 110 on the results from a pilot-scale system, the plant would have a total energy conversion efficiency of 111 23.7% for electricity. With a total plant investment at €4.79 million per megawatt capacity, the plant 112 would generate an internal rate of return of 8.3%. The authors recommended that further 113 governmental incentives for renewable energy are required to enable the project to be economically 114 attractive to investors. Rezaei et al. [19] conducted an economic assessment for power generation 115 from MSW under different scenarios in Iran. They found that gasification based EfW systems would 116 be economically viable when the MSW feedstock could attract a gate fee of US$126 per tonne and 117 the power was sold under a purchase agreement of US$0.276/kWh. In the 2016 Arup/DECC’s 118 publication on UK electricity generation cost [20], it was stated that the 2016 LCOE of ACT-based 119 EfW system with CHP was between £89 and £189 per MWh, and the capital cost of such systems 120 was up to 16.53 million per MW. The capital cost of EfW with CHP in 2016 was 6.2 million per 121 MW, as indicated in Parsons Brinckerhoff’s report on electricity generation costs model [21].  122  123 While several references have addressed the techno-economic performance of various EfW 124 processes based on gasification and pyrolysis technology, less focus has been given to the integration 125 7  of ACT and CHP systems for energy recovery from municipal waste. This aim of this work is to 126 study the technical aspects of a MSW energy recovery plant (therein referenced as the Pyro-CHP 127 system) consisting of an intermediate pyrolysis reactor and engine system for combined heat and 128 power generation and presents the economic feasibility and the parameters that affect the plant’s 129 performance and viability (Comprehensive information about the intermediate pyrolysis system can 130 be found in previously published work [22–24]). The overall mass and energy balances of the 131 pyrolysis process were developed from real experimental data obtained in pilot scale tests, and the 132 data for the engine system was carefully selected from the literature (details can be found in Section 133 2.3). All of the process streams ranging from feedstock delivery to waste disposal have been 134 considered. The results of system performance and efficiency were used in an economic evaluation 135 model to study the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) and its sensitivity to the variation of a range 136 of factors. Finally, the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) was analysed to understand the potential return 137 on investing in such a Pyro-CHP system. 138  139 2. The Process Model 140  141 2.1. Feedstock 142 The feedstock evaluated in this work was the organic fraction of MSW material provided by a local 143 municipal waste treatment plant in Leicester UK in winter. The original waste was collected from 144 local households. After mechanical removal of the majority of metals, paper/cardboard, glass and 145 plastics, the raw material mainly consisted of the organic fraction of MSW, which comprised small 146 pieces of biomass (wood and grass), plastics, decomposed materials (such as from food waste and 147 paper) and inorganics including metal, ceramics, sand etc. This material usually has high moisture 148 content due to the presence of biologically degraded food waste, and a high ash content due to the 149 presence of small inorganic material pieces that were unable to be removed in the sorting stage. 150 8  Table 1 presents the characteristics of the organic fraction of MSW feedstock evaluated in this work. 151 The methods used for the proximate and ultimate analyses are presented in the previous work 152 [24,25].  153  154 Table 1.

The integrated Pyro-CHP system 159 The Pyro-CHP system comprises five major subsystems, namely feedstock handling and pre-160 treatment, pyrolysis processing and product separation, char combustion, engine generators and 161 waste treatment and disposal. Figure 2 illustrates the schematic of the proposed process. 162  163 The system boundary of the process model includes all processing steps from feedstock reception to 164 the energy production and waste disposal. The starting point of the model is the entry of the received 165 9  feedstock into the feedstock storage units. The two endpoints of the model are: (1) the output of the 166 electrical power and heat from the CHP system and (2) the output of ash and pyrolysis water for 167 disposal.  168  169  170 Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the overall EfW process based on pyrolysis and CHP 171  172 As shown in Figure 2: upon reception, the feedstock is weighed and then stored in the feedstock 173 storage units until sent for pre-treatment. After pre-treatment, the processed feed is sent to the 174 intermediate pyrolysis reactor to produce pyrolysis liquid, gas and char products. The organic liquid 175 (pyrolysis oil) is separated from the aqueous product and stored in liquid storage units. After 176 blending with biodiesel, the liquid fuel blend will be burnt in a diesel engine based CHP system for 177 energy production. The fuel gas from pyrolysis is cleaned and directly combusted in a gas engine 178 CHP system. The pyrolysis char is burned in a combustor to provide the process heat for the 179 pyrolysis reactor. The ash from char combustion is the process waste for disposal. The detailed 180 processing in the five subsystems is described in the following sections. 181 10   182 2.2.1. Feedstock handling and pre-treatment 183 A series of handling and pre-treatment steps are required to process the received feedstock to ensure 184 the characteristics of the feedstock for the feeder and pyrolysis reactor Upon delivery, all the 185 received waste is weighed on a 50-tonne weighbridge and then stored in an 18,000 m3 concrete 186 storage unit, which is capable of storing four weeks feedstock supply. Before feeding to the 187 pyrolyser, the received MSW is shredded in a ball mill to reduce particle size to no larger than 20 188 mm. The shredded material undergoes trommel screening to ensure material particle sizes fall within 189 appropriate limits. This step is also used to eliminate about 5% of feedstock moisture and 20% of the 190 solid inert material in the feed such as metal, stones, glass etc. The oversize organic fraction is 191 recycled to the shredder, and the separated inert material is sent offsite for disposal or recycling. The 192 pre-treated feed is temporarily stored in bunker storage and then sent to the pyrolysis reactor’s 193 feeding screws by a discharge floor. A feed rate of 5 tonnes (wet) per hour was selected for this 194 work.  195  196 2.2.2. The intermediate pyrolysis system 197 The intermediate pyrolysis reactor is an auger screw reactor, comprising a horizontal carbon steel 198 vessel containing two co-axial rotating screws, which transports the feed and recycle the char inside 199 of the reactor. The reactor has one inlet for the feed, one outlet for the solid product (char) and one 200 outlet for pyrolysis vapours. The heating is provided externally through a heating jacket, and the 201 pyrolysis temperature can be maintained up to 600°C. The novel feature of this reactor is the use of 202 co-axial screws for internal char recycling. The hot recycled char acts both as heat transfer medium 203 and as a catalytic cracking medium, thereby maintaining the desired temperature inside of the reactor 204 and enhancing the secondary cracking reactions for pyrolysis vapours, so as to produce a higher 205 fraction of permanent fuel gases (H2 and CO) and lower molecular weight condensable organics and 206 11  less heavy tars. The pyrolysis liquid is usually produced with clear phase separation under gravity. 207 The liquid will be separated under gravity in the collection tank into two phases, i.e. an organic 208 fraction (pyrolysis oil) and an aqueous fraction (pyrolysis water). The pyrolysis oil has a lower 209 density than water, whilst the pyrolysis water remains in the bottom phase and can, therefore, be 210 drained and pumped to a different storage tank. In this work, a heating temperature of 500 °C and a 211 solid residence time of 10 minutes was selected for the reactor operating conditions. The detailed 212 process mass balance is presented in Section 2.3 and the characteristics of the liquid, solid and 213 gaseous products can be found in the previous related works [24,25].  214  215 The industrial intermediate pyrolysis reactor is coupled to a quench column for scrubbing and 216 condensing the pyrolysis vapour at room temperature to form the whole pyrolysis liquid. After the 217 separation of the organic fraction and aqueous fraction, the organic fraction (pyrolysis oil) is sent to 218 fuel storage. A stream of the aqueous fraction is recirculated back to the quench column for 219 condensing and scrubbing the hot pyrolysis vapour. The permanent gas then passes through a 220 dehydration column for moisture removal before it is sent to the gas engine. Both pyrolysis oil and 221 biodiesel are stored in oil tanks prior to being utilised downstream. In the industrial scale system, it 222 was estimated that process losses for liquid, gaseous and char products were 2%, 2% and 1%, 223 respectively. These values were provided by an experienced technician based on experience in the 224 long-term operation of a fast pyrolysis plant. After the scrubbing column, the pyrolysis gas (fuel gas) 225 passes through a dehydration column for gas moisture removal.  226  227 2.2.3. Char combustion 228 The solid char product is collected in a char vessel as interim storage and then directly burnt in a char 229 combustor at 1000 °C to generate hot gases to meet the heat requirement of the pyrolysis reactor. A 230 controlled stream of hot combustion flue gas (at around 700°C) is pumped into the heating jacket 231 12  located within the reactor skin to maintain the pyrolysis temperature at approximately 550 °C, which 232 is slightly higher than the demanded heating temperature. The waste-derived char may be unsaleable 233 in the market, as it usually has a high ash content and can contain contaminants. Therefore, all the 234 char product is combusted onsite to minimise the solid waste for disposal. The high-temperature flue 235 gas with (at around 300 °C) from the pyrolysis heating jacket will enter a heat exchanger for further 236 heat recovery before being emitted to atmosphere.  237  238 2.2.4. Energy generation  239 The proposed plant contains two CHP engine generator sets: a diesel engine based generator fuelled 240 by pyrolysis oil and biodiesel blends, and a gas engine based generator fuelled by fuel gas (pyrolysis 241 gas). Both engine generators produce heat and power that is sold to generate plant revenue. A dual 242 fuel engine was not considered in this work for two reasons. Firstly, typical dual fuel engines require 243 a fixed ratio of gaseous and liquid fuels, which may be different from the ratio of the pyrolysis gas 244 and oil produced from the reactor; secondly, the compatibility of a dual fuel engine operating with 245 both pyrolysis oil and gas is not proven. Pyrolysis oil and gas produced in the pyrolysis system are 246 used to generate electrical power and heat in the form of hot water. The electricity will be sold 247 through the grid to a utility company for further distribution. All the hot streams pass through a set of 248 heat exchanges which will heat water up from 40 to 70 °C for supplying to a local district heating 249 network. It was assumed that all the infrastructure is in place and can be connected when the plant is 250 ready to output power and heat.  251  252 2.2.5. Waste disposal 253 A significant waste stream generated in the plant is pyrolysis water, which is obtained as the aqueous 254 fraction of the pyrolysis liquid separated from the pyrolysis oil. The aqueous liquid from pyrolysis 255 typically contains various water-miscible chemicals produced during pyrolysis, such as alcohols, 256 13  organic acids and ketones. This liquid is disposed of to industrial sewage works at a high cost due to 257 the high chemical oxygen demand (COD) value. The ash from the char combustor is another waste 258 stream, which is sent offsite and disposed of by landfill. 259  260 2.3. Process mass and energy balances 261 A spreadsheet-based technical process model was created to represent the complete process flow as 262 presented in Figure 2. The overall model was developed with individual linked worksheets 263 containing sub-models of the system components described in Section 2.2. The primary input data of 264 the pyrolysis system was based on real experimental data from a pilot scale reactor as shown in 265 Table 2. The methods used for obtaining the process mass balance and determining the product 266 composition and characteristics were presented in the previous related work [25]. 267  268 The energy consumption of the pyrolysis system is critical since it plays a significant role in the 269 efficiency and economics of the whole process. The pyrolysis reactor is a major energy consumer 270 within the plant, as the reactor needs to be maintained at 500 °C in the continuous processing of the 271 wet MSW raw material. The continuous heat supply is achieved by burning the by-product char, 272 which is a conventional approach used in most industrial pyrolysis systems [26]. It is estimated that 273 the heat requirement of the reactor to process the chosen feedstock is 2168 kJ per kilogram of as 274 received MSW feedstock. This value is calculated based on the heat required for raising the 275 temperature of the moisture/vapour and thermal decomposition of the organic fraction of the 276 feedstock [27]. 277  278  279  280  281 14  Table 2.

For the diesel engine generator, the electrical and heat 285 efficiencies were taken to be 44% and 40% respectively. For the gas engine generator, the electrical 286 and heat efficiencies were taken to be 39% and 45% respectively.  287  288 The process efficiencies were calculated based on the relation of the total energy input from the 289 feedstock plus fuel, and the output of heat and power from the engine systems. The overall electrical 290 efficiency and overall heat efficiency were calculated as: 291  292 𝜂 𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐 =𝑃1+𝑃2𝐸𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑+𝐸𝐵𝐷× 100%             (1) 293  294 𝜂 ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡 =𝑄1+𝑄2+𝑄3−𝑄𝑅𝐸𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑑+𝐸𝐵𝐷× 100% (2) 295 15   296 Where Efeed and EBD are the energy contents of feedstock and biodiesel fuel (shown in Table 2); P1 297 and P2 are the net power outputs from the diesel engine and gas engine systems, respectively; Q1 and 298 Q2 are the net heat outputs from the diesel engine and gas engine systems, respectively; Q3 is the net 299 heat output from the char combustor and QR is the heat required by the pyrolysis reactor. The CHP 300 efficiency is the energy output divided by the energy content of the fuels. The overall Pyro-CHP 301 system efficiency is the sum of equations (1) and (2). 302  303 3. Economic Evaluation  304  305 3.1. General assumptions 306 The base year of this study was selected to be 2016. All cost data was updated by using an inflation 307 rate of 3% to the present cost in 2016 Great British Pound Sterling (GBP) [26]. All the equipment 308 cost values collected before 2016 have been adjusted to 2016 values by using the Chemical 309 Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI) [29]. These Chemical Engineering Economic Indicators (EI) 310 are EI2010= 550.8; EI2011= 585.7; EI2012= 584.6; EI2013= 567.3; EI2014= 567.1; EI2015= 556.8 and 311 EI2016= 541.7. Some cost data was collected in the currencies of EUR and USD. They were 312 converted at the rates of EUR: GBP=1: 0.8187 and USD: GBP= 1: 0.7402 (average exchange rates in 313 2016) [30].  314  315 The interest rate for the capital loan was taken to be 9.3%, which was an average interest rate taken 316 from some relevant economic studies about MSW treatment facilities or EfW projects [16,22,31–33]. 317 It was assumed that the plant technology meets the criteria of the UK’s Renewable Obligations 318 Certificates (ROC) at the ACT band with CHP and is eligible to an incentive at 1.9 ROC per 319 megawatt hour of renewable electricity generated (the rate in early 2016) [34].  320 16   321 The processing plant operates 335 days per year and will be shut down for 30 days for plant 322 maintenance. During the operational time, it is assumed that the plant availability is 95% giving 7638 323 hours per annum. The large-scale intermediate pyrolysis process is evaluated as a first of a kind 324 technology, since there is no commercial experience in the UK, excluding demonstration projects. 325 The plant life was taken to be 20 years. At the end of plant life, all the equipment will have a salvage 326 value of 10%. It is assumed that the plant was located close to an established industrial area where 327 the electricity and district heating infrastructure were in place and can be connected to the plant 328 directly. It is also assumed that the consumers were willing and able to purchase all of the products 329 (including all the electricity and heat produced) when they are available in the market. The engine 330 fuels used satisfy the criteria of the UK Renewable Obligation (RO). 331  332 3.2. Capital cost 333 In this work, the total capital requirement for the Pyro-CHP plant was calculated by using the 334 economic analysis model developed by Bridgwater et al. in the early 2000s [26]. The total plant cost 335 (TPC) was used as the measurement of the project capital cost, which is the total amount of capital 336 required to finance the whole system to the point at which it is ready to operate. This includes the 337 costs incurred in pre-development and during the construction stage. The calculation of TPC starts 338 with the summation of the equipment cost (EC), which is the cost of purchasing brand new 339 equipment for all the components in the subsystems and delivered to the plant gate. The ECs used in 340 this work were collected from quotations provided by suppliers when available, otherwise were taken 341 from published data in the literature. Incremental factors were included for erection, instrumentation, 342 piping and ducting, associated electrical equipment, structures and buildings, civil works and 343 lagging, to give a direct plant cost (DPC). Costs of engineering design and management overheads 344 are then added to give an installed plant cost (IPC), and finally commissioning costs, contractor’s 345 17  fees, interest during construction and a contingency element are added to give the TPC. These 346 increments are less specific to system modules, being usually approximated as fixed percentages of 347 direct plant cost. According to a study for a similar system, the TPC was chosen to be 1.69 times the 348 DPC, which was the production of the EC and a number of multiplication factors [26,35]. The 349 breakdown of the ECs and calculated TPC are presented in Table 3. 350  351 Table 3.

The ACC is calculated as follows: 357 18   358 𝐴𝐶𝐶 = 𝑇𝑃𝐶 𝑖(1+𝑖)𝑛𝑖(1+𝑖)𝑛−1  (3) 359  360 Where n is the project lifetime in years, and i is the interest rate for the capital loan.  361  362 3.3. Operational cost 363 3.3.1. Feedstock and gate fee 364 Treating and disposing of waste can attract a gate fee from the local authorities. This fee is levied on 365 each tonne of waste taken into the treatment plant for offsetting the plant’s capital and operation 366 costs [31], hence receiving feedstock is considered as a revenue stream. The gate fee is generally 367 specific to site, process and scale. The WRAP UK reported the median value of gate fee paid to the 368 EfW facilities in 2015/16 as £95 per tonne, and this was used in this work [40].  369  370 3.3.2. Fuel 371 A blend of biodiesel and pyrolysis oil on 50/50 volumetric ratio is required to ensure smooth 372 operation of a CHP engine running pyrolysis oil. The biodiesel price used here was £0.65/l (or 373 £0.73/kg), as agreed by local a supplier. The biodiesel is considered as a consumable of the plant, 374 and hence the cost and energy required for the biodiesel production are not considered in this work. 375 It is worth noting that value-added tax and road fuel duty is not applicable to UK commercial 376 stationary generators.  377  378 3.3.3. Utility  379 Utility costs include electricity and water usage in the plant. In this work, electricity is consumed 380 within the general plant site, office/laboratory usage and the parasitic load of the plant. The 381 19  electricity is imported from the grid to ensure stable operation of the plant The majority of the water 382 usage is for pyrolysis process cooling.  383  384 The electricity consumption rate was estimated to be 28 kWh per tonne of wet MSW treated. This 385 was converted from the data quoted by Bridgwater et al. [26] and Diebold et al. [41] based on 386 processing dried biomass in a pyrolysis plant. The average 2016 electricity price for UK medium 387 industrial consumer was taken to be £0.1084 per kWh [42]. The water usage was estimated to be 13 388 m3 per tonne of wet MSW treated. The water utility cost includes the cost of water usage and 389 sewerage surcharges. According to a UK water supplier, the water cost for a plant at the proposed 390 scale in 2016 should consist of a fixed annual charge of £1724 and a unit price of £0.2609/m3. The 391 sewerage charge should consist of a fixed annual charge of £5,673 and a unit price of £1.2347/m3 392 [43].  393  394 3.3.4. Waste disposal 395 Waste disposal includes the disposal of aqueous liquid along with pyrolysis oils and ash from the 396 combustion of pyrolysis char. UK water companies charge a “trade effluent” when industrial 397 wastewater is disposed of in the sewers. The following equation calculated the cost of trade effluent 398 based on the characteristics  of the liquid discharged to the sewage [43]: 399  400 𝐶 = 𝑅 + 𝑉𝐵 + (𝑂𝑡𝑂𝑠× 𝐵) + (𝑆𝑡𝑆𝑠× 𝑆)  (4) 401  402 Where R is reception and conveyance at a fee of £0.1813/m3; VB is volumetric and primary 403 treatment for £0.3305/m3; Ot is the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the trade effluent after one-404 hour quiescent settlement, determined by milligram of COD per litre liquid; Os is the mean strength 405 of settled sewage at a wastewater plant taken to be 489 COD mg /l; B is a biological treatment for 406 20  £0.2698/m3; St is total suspended solids of the trade effluent, determined by milligram of solid 407 content per litre liquid; Ss: the mean suspended solids content at a wastewater plant, taken to be 408 415mg/l; S is the sludge treatment and disposal for £0.2032/m3. In this work, the COD of the 409 untreated aqueous liquid is 94g/L, and total suspended solid content is less than 5mg/l. This gives a 410 calculated cost of trade effluent of £52.38 per tonne of aqueous liquid discharged.  411  412 Ash produced in the char combustion unit is sent to landfill. The cost of ash landfill includes a 413 landfill fee and a landfill tax, at rates of £19/t and £80/t in 2016 [40]. 414  415 3.3.5. Labour 416 The staffing levels of the plant were estimated to be 18 working staff per day. This includes a day 417 team formed of one plant manager, one administrator and one technical manager and a shift team 418 formed of one supervisor and four operators in three rotations. The annual average cost of 419 employment per staff was estimated to be £47,004 per year. This was calculated from the 2013 UK 420 average weekly labour wage in energy sector- £715 [44], the ratio of 2016 and 2013 UK Labour 421 Costs Index Points - 1.022 [45] and an increment (123.7%) to staff wage that covers the employer’s 422 national insurance (11%), pension contribution (5%), and training (2.7%) and administration charges 423 (5%) [35].  424  425 3.3.6. Plant maintenance and overheads  426 Annual maintenance costs and overhead costs (including insurance, rent, taxes etc.) were calculated 427 as a percentage of TPC per annum. The present study used 2.5% of TPC for plant maintenance and 428 2.0% of TPC for plant overheads costs, in line with previous comparable work [26]. 429  430 21  3.4. Energy product sales 431 3.4.1. Electricity and heat sales 432 In this work, three different electricity selling scenarios with different target customers were 433 considered to measure the profitability of the CHP plant. These included exporting the electricity 434 directly to the national grid at a rate of £0.055/kWh and selling to domestic consumers at a rate of 435 £0.1541/kWh or industrial customers at a rate of £0.1054/kWh [22,42]. The heat price was taken to 436 be £0.0403/kWh, in line with previous research [22], which allows for an assumed 10% transmission 437 loss.  It is worth noting that there are always electrical power losses of approximately 2% in the 438 distribution and transmission and heat transmission losses of approximately 10% [46,47]. However, 439 within the economic evaluations, these losses were not taken from the total saleable energy units, 440 since costs like these are typically passed on to the consumers through the selling price. It was also 441 assumed that the customers were willing and able to purchase all of the heat and power products 442 when they were available in the market.  443  444 3.4.2. Renewable energy incentives 445 Renewable Obligation (RO) was introduced by the UK government in 2002 to support the national 446 renewable energy deployment. The Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) generated by the 447 licenced renewable generators can be traded under the RO scheme and hence produce revenue for 448 the plant (detailed policy can be found in the official document [48]). It was assumed that the current 449 CHP scheme satisfies the quality assessment defined by the UK authority, which was recognised as 450 Good Quality CHP) [49]. The pyrolysis oil used satisfied the criteria of the UK Renewable 451 Obligation and fully qualified for the incentive payments. The renewable generator accredited in 452 early 2016 can receive 1.9 ROCs per kWh electrical power generated. The average trade value was 453 £44.33/ROC in 2016 [50]. 454  455 22  It is important to note that the ROC payment will only be issued to the proportion of energy 456 generated from the renewable sources with an accredited renewable system. The pyrolysis oil is 457 produced from MSW, which is recognised as a renewable feedstock. However, the biodiesel used is 458 generally produced via transesterification process of vegetable oil (or used cooking oil) with 459 methanol, which is primarily produced from natural gas by steam reforming and associated reactions. 460 It is, therefore, highly likely that the liquid fuel used in the liquid CHP engine will contain a fossil 461 part that is ineligible for claiming the ROC payment. The Fuel Measurement and Sampling (FMS) 462 method [51] issued by the UK Ofgem has clearly explained the method to calculate the mass and 463 energy shares of the different types of biodiesel. Assuming the biodiesel assessed in this work was 464 derived from used (soybean) cooking oil. It is reported that this type of biodiesel contains an average 465 mass share of 10.64% methoxy group (fossil-derived part), which is equivalent to an energy share of 466 3.92% of the total biodiesel energy content. This means 96.08% of the fuel energy in the biodiesel 467 eligible for ROC claim. Considering the blending ratio of the pyrolysis oil and biodiesel and their 468 heating values, a total of 97.80% of the energy in the fuel blend is eligible for ROC credit.  469  470 The Climate Change Levy (CCL) is a tax introduced by the UK government on energy delivered to 471 non-domestic users. It aims to provide an incentive to increase energy efficiency and to reduce 472 carbon emissions. The renewable or CHP generators are exempt from paying CCL, which was 473 £5.59/MWh in 2016 [52]. 474  475 3.5. Levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) 476 The LCOE is the minimum selling price of the product, which covers the costs of energy production 477 [32]. It is often cited as an effective measure of the overall competitiveness of different energy 478 generating technologies by the authorities [53]. In this work, the proposed system produces 479 23  combined electricity and heat. The calculation of LCOE assumes the customers can purchase the 480 heat at its market price and the associated government incentive subsidies have been paid. 481  482 The LCOE is calculated as: 483  484 𝐿𝐶𝑂𝐸 =(𝐴𝐶𝐶+𝑂𝑃)−𝑆ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑄𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐.− 𝑄𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐. × 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐.  (5) 485  486 Where, ACC is the annual cost of capital, in £/a; OP is the annual operating cost, in £/a; Q is the 487 quantity of energy product produced, in kWh/a; S is the annual sale of the product, in £/a; R is the 488 rate of incentive subsidy, in £/kWh, i.e. ROC trade value for electricity. 489  490 3.6. Internal rate of return (IRR) 491 In this work, the internal rate of return (IRR) is employed to measure and evaluate the profitability of 492 the proposed project investments. The IRR is a discounted cash flow rate of return that makes the net 493 present value (NPV) of cash flows equal to zero. The NPV is the summation of the present values 494 (PVs) of the individual annual net cash flows. The PV is the cash flow in future that has been 495 discounted to reflect its present value as if it existed today. It is a characteristic of money referred to 496 as its time value. The present value of money is always less than its future value as it has interest-497 earning potential. 498  499 The following formula is used to calculate the NPV:  500  501 𝑁𝑃𝑉 = −𝐶0 + ∑𝐶𝑡(1+𝑟)𝑡𝑇𝑡=1 + 𝐶𝑆𝑉  (6) 502  503 24  Where C0 is the initial investment; C is the cash flow; r is the discount rate; t is the year; T is the 504 project lifetime, and CSV is the PV of the salvage value of the equipment at the end of plant life.  505  506 When the NPV equals zero, the value of discount rate r is the IRR of the project. The IRR can be 507 used as an indicator of the potential probability of the project, by comparing with the target IRR. For 508 a novel technology with a high risk associated, the target IRR may be up to 25% [54]. The 509 Corporation Tax rate for the company profits was taken to be 20%, as the actual 2016 rate in the UK 510 [21]. 511  512 4. Results and Discussion 513  514 4.1. Overall process efficiencies  515 Table 4 presents the process mass and energy balances of the overall EfW plant and the overall 516 system efficiencies calculated by the model as described in Section 2.3 [22,55]. Further illustration 517 of the process energy conversion is presented in Figure 3. 518  519 Table 4.

The solid rejects are sent out of the plant as solid waste at a rate of 782.5 kg/h. 524 Therefore, 4217.5 kg of a pre-treated organic fraction of MSW was fed into the pyrolysis reactor per 525 hour, which is equivalent to 94.5% of feedstock energy input (11,527.8 kW). As described in Section 526 2.3, the intermediate pyrolysis system converts the wet solid feed into 11.6% organic liquid 527 (pyrolysis oil), 32.0% aqueous liquid (pyrolysis water), 17.4% fuel gas and 39.0% char. After 528 separation from the aqueous fraction/ pyrolysis water, the pyrolysis oil (491.2 kg/h and 3,825.6 kW) 529 was stored in the oil tank for engine use. The total energy content of the pyrolysis oil accounted for 530 33.2% of the feedstock energy input. The char production rate was 1,643.8 kg/h, accounting for 531 41.6% of the feedstock energy. All the char was combusted on site, and this was used to generate 532 4,794.7 kW heat to meet the minimum heat requirement of the pyrolyser, which was 2,222.5 kW. 533 The fuel gas consisted of nearly 40 vol. % combustible fraction with a production rate of 732.0 kg/h 534 26  giving an energy input of 1,713.9 kW to the gas CHP engine. The pyrolysis oil was blended with 535 biodiesel at 50/50 to fuel the liquid CHP engine. This, in total, was able to generate 4,436 kW 536 electrical power and 5,297 kW heat in the form of hot water. The system can achieve an electrical 537 efficiency of 27.2%, a CHP efficiency of 84% and an overall heat and power efficiency of 59.7%.  538  539  (Footnote: The colours presented in the Sankey diagram are only for distinguishing different energy streams. All values 540 given are the proportion of energy contained in each stream, referencing to the base value of 100 for the MSW feedstock) 541 Figure 3. Process energy flow 542  543 It can be observed that most of the energy losses occurred during the pyrolysis stage, where all the 544 char product was burnt to meet the heat demand of the pyrolysis reactor. In addition, hot pyrolysis 545 vapour was condensed to form liquid products, and char was cooled in the collecting vessel before 546 being sent to the burner. Heat was therefore transferred into the cooling water and air and eventually 547 ended up in the environment and became system heat losses. In real industrial applications, these 548 parts should be designed and integrated carefully to gain an optimised overall system efficiency. 549 27   550 4.2. Levelised cost of electricity  551 Figure 4 illustrates the calculated LCOE and its breakdown of contributions including the project 552 costs and incomes from incentive payment and product sales. Bars with positive values indicate the 553 direct cost incurred in the project investment and the plant operation, while the bar with negative 554 values represents the sales revenues from the heat, as well as the government incentive payments for 555 the electricity and heat. Combining all the contributing values, the LCOE value for the proposed 556 plant is £0.063 per kilowatt-hour. This value fits well in the range of the UK EfW generation cost as 557 evaluated by the BEIS, which is £0.045-0.083/kWh [56]. 558  559  560 Figure 4. Levelised Energy Cost (LCOE) and its Breakdown 561  562 The capital investment of the proposed project was calculated as £6.23 million per megawatt. This is 563 close to the lower end of the range (£5.33-£16.41/MW) of the UK bioenergy capital requirement 564 according to the Arup’s recent estimation (the range was derived after deduction of general 565 infrastructure cost from the original data quoted in the report, which accounts for 20% of the total 566 28  cost but was not considered in this work) [20]. As shown in Figure 4, this is the most significant 567 contributing factor in the LCOE. Following this is the  cost of using biodiesel to blend with the 568 pyrolysis oil for energy production, which is the highest cost in the operating cost category. Disposal 569 costs incurred, the char/ash to landfill (62% of the total) and wastewater disposal (38% of the total), 570 is the second highest cost during the plant operation. However, it is worth noting that this work did 571 not consider the opportunity in selling ash to cement businesses, which otherwise may avoid a cost 572 but attract an additional revenue stream. There is also a possibility of investing in additional 573 wastewater treatment facilities, which can reduce the COD of the pyrolysis water and consequently 574 reduce the cost of trade effluent. The labour and plant utility costs are at a similar level. The cost of 575 plant maintenance and overheads are insignificant compared to the other factors.  576  577 In the revenue stream, the waste gate-fee has become the most significant factor, which can 578 completely offset the sum of labour and biodiesel fuel costs. The renewable energy and 579 environmental incentive payments are also critical in offsetting the plant costs, and the total value is 580 almost twice the income attracted by the sales of heat. Both of the revenues from gate fees and 581 incentive payments reflect the importance of the government’s role in the deployment of sustainable 582 waste treatment and renewable energy. From the analysis, it can be understood that the sustainability 583 policies largely determine the probability of these technologies being developed at an industrial 584 scale.  585  586 4.3. Sensitivity analysis 587 Figure 5 presents the effects of input parameter variation on the LCOE, which takes into account the 588 uncertainties in these single variables. Fourteen key input parameters related to the project capital 589 cost, operating costs and productivities are analysed in turn with ± 20% changes to their baseline 590 29  data. This can be used to determine how variation in key variables can impact the LCOE and 591 consequently help the project developer to identify strategies for reducing production cost.  592  593  594 Figure 5 Sensitivity analysis for calculated LCOE 595  596 It can be observed from the chart that the plant availability has the highest impact on the LCOE. A 597 20% decrease of the current plant availability can increase the production cost by 64.2%, indicating 598 the importance of maintaining the highest possible plant availability. The power production rate of 599 the Pyro-CHP system has the second highest impact on the LCOE. A 20% increase can reduce the 600 LCOE by nearly 40%, and a 20% decrease can increase the LCOE by nearly 60%. Since the thermal 601 efficiencies of modern engine systems are relatively fixed, it is important to consider any 602 improvement that could increase the pyrolysis oil yield or the energy content (heating value) of 603 pyrolysis oil.  604  605 -60%-40%-20%0%20%40%60%Power ProductionHeat ProductionHeat PriceROC ValueGate FeePlant AvailabilityCapital CostInterest rateBiodiesel  PriceMaintenance  CostOverhead CostUtility CostLabour CostDisposal CostBaseline20% Decrease20% Increase30  The capital cost of the project, along with the interest rate charged to the capital loan, is the next 606 important influencing factor. Decreasing capital cost and interest rate by 20% can result in a 607 reduction in the production cost by 42.9% and 19.5% respectively. In real industrial development, it 608 is widely accepted that the costs of a novel process reduce as more units are built, and experience 609 accumulates. The learning effect is a factor that can be applied to the plant construction cost and 610 national electric grid and heat network connection [20]. In novel thermal energy system deployment, 611 a learning factor of 20% has frequently been applied, which can correspond to a resulted 50% 612 reduction in capital costs after ten installations of a novel process [22,26].  613  614 The changes in feedstock gate fee and ROC values earned from the electricity sales also contribute to 615 the variation of production cost considerably. Increasing the feedstock gate fee and ROC value by 616 20% can decrease the LCOE by 34.0% and 26.2% respectively. The gate fee for municipal waste is 617 expected to continually increase in the long-term, along with the increase of landfill tax and cost of 618 waste treatment due to the growing concerns over the environment and sustainability issues. A 619 similar tendency is expected in the future ROC prices, but it is important to note that the ROC can be 620 only issued for a maximum of 20 years and cannot be issued beyond 31 March 2037 [48]. The 621 effects of heat production and price and costs of labour, waste disposal, utility, maintenance and 622 overhead are relatively insignificant compared to other factors, which have been discussed.  623  624 4.4.  Internal rate of return 625 Figure 6 shows the IRR of the proposed project, which was calculated based on the cost of 626 generation, products sales (at purchase rates as described in Section 3.4.1) and gross and net profits 627 of the plant over a 20-year project lifetime. It is worth noting that this calculation did not include the 628 costs on the use of grid network for transmission and balancing service which is covered by the 629 network operator [57]. It can clearly be seen that selling the electrical power to the grid 630 31  (£0.055/kWh) can result in an IRR of -7.2%. This means that the net annual profit rates during the 631 project lifetime are eventually unable to cover the initial capital investment, even if the capital were 632 obtained at a zero interest rate.  633  634  635 Figure 6. Internal rate of return 636  637 In the cases of selling electricity to industrial and domestic customers, the project can generate 638 positive IRR and consequently make the project profitable. However, this requires the generator to 639 arrange additional retail contracts with relevant customers and play a role as a network distributor. 640 Selling electricity at a domestic rate (£0.1541/kWh) can allow the project to have an IRR of 10.1%, 641 which is 7.5% higher than selling at an industrial rate (£0.1054/kWh). Nevertheless, it is also 642 important to notice the significant differences in managing the bulk business contracts and individual 643 domestic contracts. Achieving an IRR of just over 10% is considered barely satisfactory in general 644 investment. As discussed in Section 3.6, for a novel technology with a high risk associated, a target 645 IRR up to 25% can be expected. Therefore, the economic performance of the baseline case seems 646 relatively unattractive for investors in terms of investment return.  647  648 -10%-5%0%5%10%Supply to Grid Supply toIndustrialConsumerSupply toDomesticConsumerIRR32  5. Conclusions 649  650 This work has presented the results of a techno-economic analysis on a conceptual proposed Pyro-651 CHP plant based on an intermediate pyrolysis system and CHP generator in the UK context. 652 According to the result of mass balances from pilot scale tests and literature data, a plant having 5 t/h 653 feedstock processing capacity could produce and supply 4.4 MW electrical power and 5.3 MW 654 thermal energy with an overall electrical efficiency of 27.2% and overall CHP efficiency of 59.7%. 655 The most significant heat loss occurred in the pyrolysis process, where a considerable heat was 656 required to maintain the reaction temperature of the pyrolyser.  657  658 The economic analysis indicated that the levelised electricity cost of the plant was £0.063/kWh, 659 which agree the range of UK EfW cost as evaluated by the UK government. The capital investment 660 was calculated to be £6.23 million per megawatt for the specific plant evaluated. The breakdown 661 analysis of the production cost showed that the capital cost was the largest part of the LCOE. 662 Following that were the costs of biodiesel fuel, waste disposal, labour, utility and plant maintenance 663 and overheads. Compared to the product sales, the income from feedstock gate fee and the renewable 664 incentive payment played a more significant role in offsetting the production cost. This implied the 665 importance of the government’s and policymakers’ role in the economic viability of such projects. 666 To maximise the feasibility of a project, the technology developer should endeavour to seek the 667 routes to reduce electricity production cost and identify the target customers that can pay electricity 668 at a high rate. Special attention should be given to the most influential factors as indicated in the 669 sensitivity analysis, such as feedstock cost (or gate fee for waste), enhancing the plant availability, 670 increasing the productivities of the fuels and electric power, reducing equipment costs and ensuring 671 the heat sales can meet the target level. 672  673 33  Acknowledgements 674 The authors would like to acknowledge the support from the EPSRC under SUPERGEN Bioenergy 675 PyroAD project (Reference No. EP/K036793/1) and the British Council’s UK-Gulf Institutional 676 Links Grant for the project entitled “Solar powered fast pyrolysis for producing bio-oils from 677 municipal solid waste in the State of Kuwait” (Reference No. 279359364). 678  679 REFERENCES  680 [1] Tolvik Consulting.
