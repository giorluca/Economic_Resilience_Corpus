Of special interest was the effect on the METS firms of the structure and governance of the resource industry regional supply network in terms of their ability to adapt to the downturn and the implications for regional resilience.  The research was driven by the common problem faced by METS suppliers operating in resource extractive economies of how to prosper in spite of fluctuating mineral commodity prices. Downturns in commodity prices usually result in significant job losses, reduction in GDP growth and economic decline. It requires resilience at the firm and regional level to not only cope and recover from external shocks, but also to create new technological paths. Previous research into the regional development of resource-extractive regions has proved that the development of technology and knowledge intensive, value-adding industries around resource extractive activity enhances the resilience of resource economies. A diverse and technology intensive METS sector emerging naturally in proximity to resource extraction sites is potentially able to use its accumulated knowledge and capabilities to overcome the consequences of a decline. In the right environment, METS firms can develop high value-added products and services that can have other industrial applications and find new niches in domestic and overseas markets. The ability of local METS companies to diversify and innovate results in the lateral transfer of technologies developed initially to serve the resource sector, encouraging regional economic diversification and the development of alternative growth paths during a decline in the resource sector. Supply chain relationships are critical to the strategic diversification and innovation of regional METS experiencing resource constraints. Their ability to innovate and diversify depends not only on their own internal research and development efforts, but mostly on their collaboration with customers and supply chain partners around customer problems and solutions. Since there are multiple shared suppliers and clients, a regional supply network serves as a conduit for information and knowledge transfer. Our knowledge of the impact of the structure and governance in a regional supply network and firm diversification and innovativeness is still limited, however. There is a lack of conceptual explanation specific to how network governance in a regional supply network influences METS firms’ ability to respond during those periods when the whole network is experiencing constrained resources.  To address this problem in the current research, a multilevel conceptual framework was developed, and a mixed-method research design adopted. The findings demonstrated that formal and informal instruments of regional supply network governance impact firms’ strategies and facilitates both short-term adaptation and the long-term adaptability of regional METS. The research contributes to the economic resilience literature by providing empirical evidence of the role of regional supply network structure and governance as factors influencing regional firms’ strategies at the micro-level. In turn, the strategies and behaviour of regional METS firms at the micro level impact adaptability and regional resilience at the meso-level. Therefore, a coordinated effort by governing bodies through policies and resource allocation is required to ensure the formation of well-connected, integrated regional supply networks that can foster long term adaptability and resilience in resource extractive regions.   xiv Acknowledgements I must acknowledge here financial and informational support of the Mining Industry Participation Office, the State Government of South Australia for a Centre of Excellence Research Grant.

It adjusts for the lack of multivariate normality in the data. Bootstrapping In a modeling context, statistical bootstrapping is a technique that samples data from within a data set and generates standard errors based on repeated estimates of sample parameters.  Capability diversification In this research METS capability diversification or service breadth was measured as the number of services and products offered to customers. CFA Confirmatory Factor Analysis – is a statistical technique used to verify the factor structure of a set of observed variables. It is used when the model is specified a priory. Construct A construct refers to a complex concept. Construct Validity Construct validity is the degree of conformity between a theoretical concept and a particular measuring device or procedure. Convergent Validity  This represents a measure of the extent of the direct structural relationship between an observed variable and a latent construct. Convergent validity is achieved when the correlation (that is, the factor loading) is significantly different from zero. Dependent variable Sometimes referred to as a endogenous variable. Endogenous variables are hypothesised to be caused by other variables in a model. This is indicated by arrows pointing to an endogenous variable from another variable.  Discriminant Validity Discriminant validity represents the degree to which the model constructs are dissimilar. Evaluating discriminant validity is important where the constructs are interrelated. Large correlations between the latent constructs (more than 0.80 or 0.90) suggest a lack of discriminant validity. In order to meet discriminant validity requirements, the average variance extracted for two constructs should be greater than the square of the correlation between the constructs. Embeddness The degree to which economic activity is constrained by non-economic institutions (Polaniy, 1944). Granovetter (1985) further defined it as ability of individuals to make decisions not only based on economic benefits but also with consideration of social relations they are embedded in. Embeddedness in supplier-buyer relationships refers to the interdependence or joint dependence of a company and its suppliers and customers (Gulati, & Sytch, 2007; Kim, Choi, & Skilton, 2015) GDP Gross Domestic Product GSP Gross State Product Independent variable Sometimes referred to as an exogenous variable. Exogenous variables have no hypothesised origin in a model and therefore no direct causal arrows point toward them (c.f. an endogenous variable). Innovativeness The process of making changes to products, processes, and services that result in new value creation to the organisation and its customers by leveraging knowledge efforts of the firm and (or) that of its supply network partners (OECD, 2009). In this research METS firm innovativeness was measured as the number of new products and services introduced over the last three years. xvi Latent variable A latent variable represents a variable that cannot be directly observed. Because a latent variable cannot be observed directly, it cannot be measured directly; thus it must be operationally defined and measured in terms of behaviour believed to represent the particular latent variable (Byrne, 2001). In terms of a latent variable, the measured scores can be produced in terms of responses to particular questions on a survey. These responses which provide ‘measured scores’ are sometimes referred to as observed variables or indicator items (or items). METS Mining Equipment and Technology Services – companies that receive a substantial portion of their revenue, directly or indirectly from mining companies for the provision of goods and services based on specialised technology, intellectual property or knowledge (Martinez-Fernandez, 2010) PLS SEM Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modelling. Two types of SEM are used for analysis: covariance-based (CB-SEM) and variance-based partial least square techniques (PLS SEM, Hair, Sarstedt, Pieper, & Ringle, 2012). CB-SEM is aimed at estimating model parameters in a way that the difference between the estimated and sample covariance matrices is minimised, while PLS-SEM maximises the explained variance of the endogenous latent variables by estimating partial model relationships in an iterative sequence of ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. In this thesis PLS SEM method is used. Positional embeddedness Positional embeddedness reflects the ‘roles’ that network actors occupy in the system, irrespective of the specific traits of these peers and the nature of the relationships between them. It goes beyond direct and indirect ties of a focal actor and explains the benefits associated with a certain position in the network through application of network models of equivalence and centrality (Borgatti, & Li, 2009) Regional adaptability Adaptability is an accumulation of unspecific capabilities that can lead to unforeseeable innovations and structural changes. Adaptability enables the development of new pathways as an escape from ‘path dependence’ (Christopherson, Michie, & Tyler, 2010; Grabher, 1993) Regional adaptation Adaptation refers to the incremental innovations and increasing specialisation that reproduce existing structures in the regional economy. Adaptation is concerned with changes within existing paths (Christopherson et al., 2010; Grabher, 1993) Regional resilience A long-term adaptive capacity of the regions to accommodate external shocks by reconfiguring their socio-economic and institutional structure to develop new growth paths (Boschma, 2014; Martin, 2015) Regional supply network For the purpose of this study, a regional industry supply network is defined and limited to a subset of supplier-buyer relations that exist upstream from a resource extraction (mining) companies operating in the resource extractive region Relational embeddedness Relational embeddedness is the nature of the relationships of a firm with its direct counterparts. It addresses the nature and quality of relationships between exchange partners, which reflects the degree of their interdependence. In this research relational embeddedness was defined as an aggregate of three dimensions: trust, information exchange and joint problem solving between supplier (METS firm) and client (Gulati, & Sytch, 2007; McEvily and Marcus, 2005). Relational embeddedness is one of the major governance mechanisms in inter-firm networks (W. Powell, 1990). Reliability Reliability is the level to which an observed variable measures the ‘true’ value of a variable and the extent to which it is ‘error free’ (‘reliability’ is the opposite of ‘measurement error’). It refers to the consistency of measurement and can be It refers to the consistency of measurement and can be conceptualised as that part of a measure that is free of purely random error. In this research, reliability is measured using Cronbach alpha and composite reliability. xvii Resource extraction Resource extraction includes mineral and gas extraction, and also resource-specific manufacturing (such as the production of metals and refined petroleum) (James Bishop, Christopher Kent, 2013) Resource related activities Resource-related activity includes investment that supports future production of resources as well as the provision of intermediate inputs that are used in the current production of resources. … [I]t captures activities that are directly connected to resource extraction, such as constructing mines and associated infrastructure, and transporting inputs to, and taking extracted resources away from, mines. It also captures some activities less obviously connected to resource extraction, such as engineering and other professional services (legal and accounting work, for example) (Rayner, & Bishop, 2013) Sectoral diversification Market diversification is defined as strategic redeployment of existing capabilities and assets in new directions or gradual movement to closely related markets. In this research sectoral diversification of the METS firm was measured as the number of sectors METS firm operates. SEM Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is a general name for the statistical analysis of Structural Equation Models. Structural Equation Models are models that identify relationships among sets of variables. These can be identified by means of path diagrams.  Validity Validity refers to the accuracy of a measure. It exists when a measure is a perfect representation of the variable being measured.    xviii            this page intentionally left blank for pagination   1        The impact of regional supply network structure and governance on the resilience of resource extractive regions:  The case of South Australia  In the short run, actors create relations; in the long run, relations create actors. (Padgett, & Powell, 2012, p.2)    2 Preface This research has evolved from a long interest and personal involvement in the resource sector and its challenges. My parents in Kazakhstan ran a medium size company supplying construction services to an asbestos mining company in a small company town, and on completion of my engineering postgraduate degree from Kazakh National Technical University, I began examining the managerial problems faced by mining regional communities. During 2009-2010, as a member of a consultancy team I began working with the senior managers in a mining company implementing a change management initiative. Through this experience, I developed an understanding of the overall problems faced by the mining industry in Kazakhstan. Due to low development of ‘soft’ skills and poor management practices, the industry experienced ‘lock-in’ as a result of an obsolete mindset and inability to see opportunities outside the traditional trajectories. The rigid mindset of engineers and managers working in mining companies and in firms providing services to the mining industry made any change difficult and had resulted in limited innovation within the industry as traditional business practices were enforced. The GFC of 2008 highlighted the need for major transformation in the mining sector in order to sustain it through downturns in mineral commodity prices.  Clusters became a popular paradigm for change in 2012-2015 in Kazakhstan, and were seen as a ‘silver bullet’ to move the mining sector towards innovative development. From 2010 there had been an increasing interest in the development of mining clusters in Kazakhstan, followed by an invitation from Michael Porter, the leading American economist to conduct an analysis of the mining sector.  Western school management practices and approaches to change management became very popular. In Kazakhstan, both Australia and Canada were considered advanced economies that had successfully managed to develop knowledge intensive service industries from natural resource endowments. The Kazakhstan mining leaders have been seeking ways to adopt the experience of Australia and Canada in terms of policy frameworks and regulations of the mining sector to attract foreign investment. These events in Kazakhstan to a large extent influenced my decision to explore management practices in the Australian resource extractive sector to augment my understanding of resource economies in transition. 3 I travelled to Australia in order to explore mining industry strategies, policies and management practices. In particular, I was interested in the issues associated with the development of mining clusters with an emphasis on local supply chains. I began ongoing discussions with government bodies involved in the South Australian mining industry transformation and the development of the regional supply chains to get a better understanding of the current challenges faced by mining companies and local suppliers [i.e., the mining equipment and technology services (METS) sector].  During the period of downturn in commodity prices, a pessimistic outlook in the sector was prevailing, and deteriorating economic forecasts for regional areas were the major concerns. These single company towns experienced huge job losses due to their substantial dependence on resource and energy enterprises that included Arrium Mining in Whyalla, Alinta Energy (a coal power station in Port Augusta), and the Nyrstar smelter in Port Pirie. The closure of Alinta Energy, the frozen operations of Arrium Mining and the reduced production volume of Nyrstar reminded me of the challenges of small single-industry towns in Kazakhstan. These experiences influenced the development of the research questions addressed in this research and I genuinely hope that the findings of my research make (even a small) difference for the communities dependent on resource industries.      4                             this page intentionally left blank for pagination     5 Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1  Introduction The thesis explores the case of the South Australian resource extractive industry in 2012-2016 experiencing decline due to downturn in the commodity prices. The primary objective of this thesis is to identify in what way network structure and governance in the resource industry regional supply chains influenced South Australian Mining Equipment and Technology Services (SA METS) strategies and behaviour in changing economic environment. At the firm level, regional supply network acts as an environment for local METS firms that impacts their ability to adapt. In turn, firms adaptability at the micro-level with regional supply network structure and governance at the meso-level both contribute to adaptability and resilience of resource extractive region.  This chapter is organised as follows: Section 1.2 describes the research problem and sets the research questions and objectives, Section 1.3 briefly introduces research design – conceptual framework development and methodology adopted for this study, Section 1.4 justifies significance of the research. Section 1.5 introduces the broader context of this research - Australian resource economy and the nature of global resource sector, in the Section 1.6 the definition of Mining Equipment and Technology Services (METS) is provided. Section 1.7 discusses peculiarities of the South Australian resource extractive and METS sector. Section 1.8 provides outline of the thesis organisation and section 1.9 summarises the chapter.

Summary SA METS sector  Thesis organisation 6 1.2  Problem statement This research was driven by the common problem faced by many resource extractive economies of how to prosper despite fluctuating mineral commodity prices. Downturns in commodity prices result in significant job losses, reduction in GDP growth and economic decline. It requires adaptability at the firm and regional level to not only cope and recover from external shocks, but to create new technological paths that make the region more resilient in the future. Previous research into the regional development of resource-extractive regions proved that ability of regional METS companies to diversify and innovate is key to formation of resilient resource extractive regions able to develop alternative growth paths, when there is a decline in the global resource sector (e.g. Chapman, MacKinnon, & Cumbers, 2004; Warrian & Mulhern, 2009). The development of technology and knowledge intensive, value-added industries around resource extractive activity enhances the resilience of resource economies. Since a diverse and technology intensive METS sector emerges naturally in proximity to resource extraction sites to support resource projects, this sector is potentially able to use its accumulated knowledge and capabilities to find ways of dealing with economic downturns. In the right environment, METS firms develop the capacity for high value-added products and services that can be applied in other industry sectors, and find new niches in domestic and overseas markets. Thus, the ability of local METS companies to diversify and innovate results in the lateral transfer of technologies developed initially to serve the resource sector, encouraging regional economic diversification and the development of alternative growth paths during a decline in the resource sector. Previous research also proved that supply chain relationships are critical to capability development of regional METS often experiencing resource restraints. Their ability to innovate and diversify depends not only on their own internal research and development efforts, but mostly on their collaboration with customers and supply chain partners around customer problems and solutions (e.g. Martinez-Fernandez, 2010; Scott-kemmis, 2013). Our knowledge of the mechanisms acting in a regional supply network is limited, however. There is a lack of conceptual explanation specific to how network governance in a regional supply network influences METS firms’ ability to respond during those periods when the whole network is experiencing constrained resources. Organisational studies acknowledge role of network governance and firms embeddness in a network in enhancing operational 7 and innovative performance of participating firms in other industry sectors, including but not limited to biotechnology and apparel industries (W. Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr, 1996; Uzzi, 1996, 1997). This thesis addresses the above-mentioned gaps by exploring how embeddedness in the regional supply network influences METS firms’ ability to diversify and innovate, thus contributing to adaptation of resource extractive regions during downturn in the resource sector.  This PhD research sought to investigate in particular:  1 various kinds of strategies SA METS firms developed to sustain and grow their businesses in 2014-2016 during the downturn in the resource sector  2 structure and governance instruments of the SA regional resource industry supply network  3 the relationships between network embeddedness of SA METS companies’ and their ability to adapt through innovation and diversification 4 the relationships between regional resource industry supply network structure and governance and regional adaptability and resilience Central to this research are the following research questions: RQ 1.  What kinds of strategies were used by SA METS companies to adapt during the downturn in the resource sector in 2014-2016? RQ1.1  What kinds of adaptability strategies including innovativeness and diversification (involving emergence of value added activities) were used by SA METS during downturn in the resource sector in 2014-2016? RQ1.2  What kinds of short-term adaptation strategies were used by SA METS during downturn in the resource sector in 2014-2016? RQ 2. How does positional and relational embeddedness affect development of adaptability strategies (diversification and innovativeness) of METS firms at the firm level? RQ2.1 Are there relationships between SA METS firm diversification and innovativeness? RQ2.2  What is the impact of SA METS firm positional embeddedness in the regional resource industry supply network on its sectoral and capability diversification strategies? 8 RQ2.3  What is the impact of SA METS firms’ positional embeddedness in the regional resource industry supply network on its innovativeness? RQ2.4  What is the impact of SA METS firms’ relational embeddedness in the regional supply networks (trust, joint action and information exchange) on METS firms’ sectoral and capability diversification strategies? RQ2.5  What is the impact of SA METS firms’ relational embeddedness in the regional supply networks (trust, joint action and information exchange) on its innovativeness? RQ3.  How do network governance instruments contribute to adaptability and resilience of resource extractive regions through emergence of value-added industries around resource extractive activity? RQ3.1  How effective were governance instruments applied in the SA resource industry regional supply network during downturn from 2014 to 2016? RQ3.2  In what way did regional supply network structure and governance contribute to adaptation and resilience of the SA resource extractive economy during downturn from 2014 to 2016? 1.3 Research methodology and significance To answer the research questions, a pragmatist research paradigm with the mixed methods research design was adopted to explore adaptation processes in the South Australian resource-extractive sector from 2014 till 2016, which experienced economic downturn when there was a global decline in the commodity prices. The research design included three major stages.   At the first stage, the literature search and in-depth exploratory interviews with key informants including state and national government officials, mining companies and Tier 1 EPCM providers, resource industry association leaders were conducted to inform the development of the conceptual framework.   The second stage involved a survey of METS firms operating in South Australia coupled with the analysis of supply network connections among SA METS firms have been conducted to test relationships postulated in the conceptual framework.    9  The last stage incorporated qualitative interviews with the SA METS firms to get insights into the strategies of adaptation during the downturn in the resource sector, the role of position and relationships within the SA resource supply chain.  In addition, the researcher drew on multiple secondary sources including industry and government reports and field notes from observations, participation in the industry networking events and conferences to build up the case. Mixed methods research design, as well as variety of sources used in the current research ensured the validity of the findings through methodological and source triangulation. Contribution to theory. This research contributes to the economic geography literature concerned with the evolution of extractive regions and clusters, by exploring transformation processes in the South Australian resource extractive industry during the downturn in commodity prices from 2014 till 2016. The research combined an evolutionary view on regional resilience, network governance and regional development of resource extractive regions literature to develop a multi-level conceptual framework. The conceptual framework developed in this study links regional supply network positional and relational embeddedness with METS firms’ ability to adapt during a downturn in the resource sector through innovation and diversification. The moderating effects of tier position within the supply chain structure and membership in industry associations were also tested. This research also contributes to the regional resilience literature by providing empirical evidence of the micro-level mechanisms – local METS firms’ strategies and behaviour and regional supply network structure and governance on – the resilience of mature industrial regions. This research extends the framework for exploring transformation and adaptation of resource extractive regions proposed by (Chapman et al., 2004) and addresses the calls in the literature for the provision of evidence of the role of agency – micro-level strategies and behaviour producing meso-level outcomes.  Furthermore, although much of the thesis clearly articulates with economic geography it is also contributes to complex project management discipline. First, there is an obvious emphasis on what might be termed Complex Project Management theory and practice. Complex Project Management in this sense has a primary focus on projects that involve adaptive and network centric systems co-ordinated by multiple stakeholders to achieve outcomes desired by all parties. Furthermore, regional 10 supply network is a complex system driven by endogenous mechanisms and its development thus is a complex project from the perspective of a governing body. Second, in the context of an industry that is forced by economic circumstances to evolve new forms of operation, through innovation and organisational change, there is a pressing need to bring into play ‘big picture’ strategic thinking with the recognition of the networked effects of regional supply chain systems and their impact on adaptability and resilience of industrial regions. Third, as the thesis continuously demonstrates, the top-down hierarchical and linear models of management are less relevant in the context of an industry in transition, which is invariably complex. Taken together the thesis has an equally strong interest in the contextual and conceptual aspects of Project Management. Contribution to practice. From the practical perspective, the findings of this thesis inform policy makers and industry stakeholders involved into the development of the South Australian METS sector. Understanding pathways for economic renewal and diversification and the role of regional supply network structure and governance in this process is particularly important for more effective allocation of resources and development of policies and incentives to ensure resilience and future sustainable growth of the SA economy.  1.4  Research motivation: Why South Australian METS firms? The selection of the South Australian resource sector as a case for this research was influenced by the following factors. Firstly, the mining industry and related services sector make a significant contribution to exports and the gross state product in South Australia. South Australia will continues to rely on resource sector as a major contributor to its Gross State Product. Secondly, the development of efficient and competitive local supply chains for resource sector is one of the top priorities for the South Australian government. Thirdly, the focus of interest is on the large-scale transformation and restructuring of the South Australian regional supply chains, which took place in the mining sector because of global downturn in commodity prices. Finally, the researcher developed interest and connections with practitioners in the SA resource industry through involvement in resource related projects for the last five years. The researcher has a background and understanding of the resource industry and its peculiarities from her past experience.   11 1.4.1 Australian resource economy Since minerals were first discovered in Australia in the 1840s, many regions have been opened up by resource development. Resource regions have become important from both a government and community perspective since resource extraction provides significant economic return, although it does so by expending non-renewable assets. Resource development in Australia has given rise to settlements and infrastructure development, including roads, ports, airports and railways. Other benefits include contributions to rural and regional development, technology innovation and environmental research. Since 2000 there has been significant growth in mining commodity exports, resulting from the increasing demand for raw materials from China and India, which has contributed significantly to the growth of the Australian economy. Currently, Australia is a major global producer of minerals, and the world’s largest exporter of coal, iron ore, bauxite, lead, zirconium and titanium; the second largest exporter of gold, zinc and uranium; the third largest exporter of silver, nickel and aluminum; and the fourth largest exporter of diamonds. In 2015, the mining sector contributed around 8.5% to Australia’s GDP and employed 2% of the workforce. Currently, mining made up over 50% of Australia’s total export earnings (Austmine, 2015).  The major export markets are China and India, large economies with low levels of GDP per capita and even with the recent downturn in commodity prices, they are likely to remain in the high energy and materials-intensive phase of economic development in the foreseeable future. Australia currently has long-term (over 20-year) contracts to supply gas to China, India, Japan and South Korea. According to forecasts by the Department of Industry and Science, minerals and energy export earnings will increase by around 6% per year between now and 2020. Despite Australia being one of the few countries that has managed to grow into one of the world’s most advanced economies by exploiting its natural resources, its economy is still vulnerable to cyclical downturns in mineral commodity prices, just as are other countries that export natural resources (Rehner, Baeza, & Barton, 2014).    12 1.4.2 The cyclical nature of the resource sector and its impact on economies The resource sector globally is characterised by ‘boom and bust’ cycles associated with the volatility of commodity prices. The recent global downturn in commodity prices that began in mid-2011, has resulted in a massive slowdown in the resources extractive sector in Australia since 2013, resulting in currency depreciation and increased unemployment rates (Figure 1.2). Since the resource sector is capital-intensive, price level cycles are mainly driven by liquidity – the availability of investment funding. Mining booms are characterised by periods when investors are willing to pay a premium, and assign high market value to exploration potential, whereas mining busts find investors are risk averse, and miners trade at a discount in value. The lags between demand and supply, the ‘herd behavior’ of stock markets, and the dependence on the overall well-being of major economies consuming resource commodities are major factors contributing to the dynamics of resource production and marketing at the global scale.  Figure 1.2  Mining investment and employment in Australia from 2002 till 2016 (ABS, NAB Group Economics1) Boom periods in the mining sector usually lead to increased capital investment, exploration activity and new mines opening. High export commodity prices drive national currency appreciation and disproportionally high wages in the mining sector compared to other sectors of the economy. This leads to an increase in prices for products and services supplied to the mining sector, contributing to an                                                      1 http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-06-10/mining-investment-and-employment/7500786, accessed 4 Oct 2017 13 overall high-cost local economy. Other industry sectors become non-competitive on the export market due to the high value of the domestic currency. Bust periods are associated with national currency depreciation, massive retrenchment and rising unemployment. The economy is forced to restructure again due to the massive release of a highly-qualified workforce. Service sectors experience reduced demand, and a search for new strategies – including downsizing, diversifying to other sectors and finding new market niches – begins.  These periods of restructuring due to an economic downturn are of great concern to government bodies at all levels. Tax regulations and policies are implemented to mitigate the effects on national and regional economies, and governments often support other sectors by spending, for example, on defence and infrastructure projects, to stimulate local economy and create more jobs. To support local industries supplying goods and services to the resource sector, the government encourages and supports innovation and diversification strategies, export, partnering and alliance formation to survive through the downturn. On a positive note, the decline can be seen as an opportunity for many companies to find new development paths, for governments to re-orient the economy towards the development of more sustainable industries, for entrepreneurs to find new market niches, and a general move away from resource export dependency. During the mining boom, the rapid increase in demand for natural resources usually leads to significant growth in the resource extraction sector triggering the development of other industries providing inputs to resource extraction activity – the mining equipment and technology services (METS). The most recent growth of Australian METS sector occurred in 2010-2012 in response to the massive demand for services from the expanding resource industry. Since then, this resource-related activity has become more intensive in the use of labour, technology and knowledge than the resource extraction sector itself and has provided a significant contribution to the economy in terms of GDP, export and employment.  Since 2013, as a result of a drop in commodity prices largely dependent on slowdown of Chinese economy, there has been a significant reduction in investment in exploration projects and current operating mines in Australia, which has resulted in a decreased demand for METS services. 14 Nevertheless, according to an Austmine2 survey (2015), in 2015 the METS sector still contributed around $AUD90 billion in revenue to the economy, a large proportion of which came from exported products or services. The average national contribution of METS sector to Australia’s GDP came to 4.7% in 2015. The METS sector is one of the most internationalised sectors in Australia, with approximately 66% of companies exporting products and services all over the world. It is also an important contributor in terms of employment, with over 350 000 workers across Australia.  1.4.3  South Australian resource economy South Australia has had a long engagement in the resource extraction sector, with the major oil and gas company SANTOS being established in South Australia in 1954, and Roxby Downs in 1970 to support the BHP Olympic Dam mine and other mining investments.  In South Australia, as in other states, resource extraction and related activities make a significant contribution to exports and the gross state product and the effects of downturn were more significant than in other Australian states. The South Australian resource economy is considered to be smaller than in other Australian states, e.g., Western Australia, Queensland and New South Wales. South Australia’s shares in Australia’s key mineral resources are as follows: copper 69%, gold 28% and uranium 81%. The exploration expenditure was AUD 617.4 million in 2014, including AUD 106.7 million for minerals exploration and AUD 510.7 million for petroleum exploration. The capital expenditure in 2013-2014 was 1.8 billion, the mineral production was AUD 5.6 billion and petroleum production – 1.9 billion. In 2015 the sector contributed 39% to state exports, which is AUD 4.5 billion, including AUD 4.3 billion for Minerals and AUD 0.2 for petroleum commodity (Heithersay, 2015).  In the current downturn period, the economy of South Australia has been significantly affected by large-scale mining projects, which are the key sources of market demand for South Australian technology and services suppliers. The major tenements in November 2014 are identified in Table 1.1 and major mining and oil and gas projects in 2014-2015 are illustrated in Figure 1.3.                                                         2 Austmine is the national industry body for the mining equipment, technology and services (METS) sector. http://www.austmine.com.au/ 15 Table 1.1  Mineral tenements (November 2014) (Heithersay, 2015) Type of a tenement Number of tenements mining leases 861 extractive mining leases  649 private mines  235 operating mines ~450 major operating mines ~20 opal mining claims 380 advanced mineral projects ~30 former mines 3500   Figure 1.3 Major mining and oil and gas projects (approved/operating and developing) (Heithersay, 2015)  16 1.5 What are mining equipment and technology services? The focus of this research was the resource extractive and associated mining equipment and technology services (METS) sector. For the purposes of this research the term resource economy is used to identify resource extraction and resource-related activity. 1.5.1  Resource extraction and resource-related activities The resource economy is composed of actors that own mines and deposits and conduct exploration activities, such as major and junior mining companies and concentration plants, situated in close proximity to the ore deposits. In this thesis, all economic activity in the resource economies is conceptually divided into three parts: (i) resource extraction, (ii) resource-related activity, and (iii) non-resource activity (Bishop & Kent, 2013). …Resource extraction includes mineral and gas extraction, and also resource-specific manufacturing (such as the production of metals and refined petroleum).  Resource-related activity includes investment that supports future production of resources as well as the provision of intermediate inputs that are used in the current production of resources. … [I]t captures activities that are directly connected to resource extraction, such as constructing mines and associated infrastructure, and transporting inputs to, and taking extracted resources away from, mines. It also captures some activities less obviously connected to resource extraction, such as engineering and other professional services (legal and accounting work, for example). Non-resource activity includes everything else in the economy that does not have a direct relationship to the current and future production of resources. … (Rayner & Bishop, 2013, p. 22) By clarifying the differences between these definitions, the authors stress that:  Among other things, there are income effects associated with dividend payments to households, the benefits of tax revenue from resource extraction and resource-related activities, and spending by those working in those industries. However, only production, not income linkages, are considered…(Rayner & Bishop, 2013). Thus, resource-related activities are performed by a diverse range of local companies located in proximity to mining extraction hubs addressing the needs of the major operators of the mining 17 deposits, such as the supply of manufactured inputs and construction services (Bas & Kunc, 2009; Knobblock, 2013). The schematic representation of the resource sector core and related activities is depicted in Figure 1.4.  Figure 1.4  Simplified diagram of resource related activities (from Knobblock & Pettersson, 2010) Resource related services are referred to as mining equipment and technology services (Scott-Kemmis, 2013), mining supply and services (Warrian, & Mulhern, 2009), mineral inputs (M. Walker, & Minnitt, 2006a), mining technology services (MTS) (Martinez-Fernandez, 2010), mining equipment and specialist services (Kaplan, 2012), mining core and related activities (Knobblock, 2013), specialised knowledge intensive mining services providers (SKIMS) (Morris, Kaplinsky, & Kaplan, 2012). The more restrictive specification emphasises firms with specialist technology related to the mining life-cycle, while a more inclusive approach incorporates suppliers of contract mining and construction services (Scott-Kemmis, 2013) (Figure 1.5). The Australian Technology Services Action Agenda (MTSAA) group define the MTS as:  Comprising of companies, institutions , associations and other organisations that receive a substantial portion of their revenue, directly or indirectly from mining companies for the provision of goods and servises based on specialised technology, intellectual property or knowledge… (Martinez-Fernandez, 2010)   18              Figure 1.5 The composition of the METS sector (METS Ignited Report, 2017)  19 1.5.2 Tiered structure of the resource industry supply chains Despite the output of the resource industry in commodity production, which has less variety and low complexity compared to the products of high-value added industries, it is characterised by significant supply chain complexity due to highly diverse inputs and high integration into the global supply chain.  The typical mining company establishes its supply chain to procure the major stages of mining projects. As shown in Figure 1.6, these major stages include exploration, project management, construction, operation and rehabilitation phases. METS suppliers perform various activities at the different stages of a mining project. A broader definition of resource and energy supply chain also includes downstream links to smelters and metal processing plants (Warrian, & Mulhern, 2009).   Figure 1.6 The METS services involved at the different stages of the mining project (Department of State Development, 2015) Tier 1 suppliers. The Tier 1 suppliers to mining companies are represented by the Engineering Procurement and Construction Management (EPCM) or Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) providers. These large project management and engineering companies cover a broad range of capabilities and are highly diversified. They operate in multiple sectors including the global markets of water, energy and resources, environment, property and buildings, and transportation projects.  20 These companies can take on the risks of big mining projects and usually provide such services as design, feasibility studies, and execution of the design, procurement, installation and operation of the facility as a single package.  Tier 2 suppliers. Tier 2 suppliers are usually represented by companies, whose core business is in construction, engineering and project management or those of original equipment manufacturers (OEM). These companies are engaged at early stages of a mining project. Tier 2 servicing EPCMs are also large, international engineering companies that are not necessarily associated directly with the resource industry. They usually provide construction, maintenance and industrial services to the resources, energy and infrastructure sectors. OEMs are international companies who may work directly with mining companies or sub-contract to EPCM providers or work with other Tier 2 service providers.  Tier 3 and 4 suppliers. Tier 3 sub-contra
