Fermi 2749-1-21027 Ispra (VA), ItalyAbstractCar exhaust heat recovery is being investigated in recent years as a way to increase the efficiency of Internal Combustion engines and simultaneously to reduce CO2 emissions by converting the thermal energy to electrical, employing either thermal fluid systems (mainly the Rankine Cycle) or Thermoelectric Generators. Research has shown that conversion of 10% of this waste heat into electricity may result to an increase of fuel efficiency of up to 20%. Particularly, in the case of heavy duty vehicles there is evidence in the literature that assuming certain designs and manufacturing costs, a heat recovery system can increase the total powertrain efficiency by almost 30%. This paper presents an analytic model for examining the environmental and economic benefits of car exhaust heat recovery using the aforementioned technologies. The main input parameters to the model are: the cost of ownershipof the vehicle, which includes fixed expenses to purchase and own the vehicle and variable costs for its use and operation.  Results presented in this paper show that, for heavy duty vehicles fitted with a heat recovery system the assumed basic cost increase could be paid back within approximately 1 to 9.5 years depending on the annual mileage, fuel price and fuel efficiency benefit varying between 20% and 10%. Moreover, the CO2 emissions pay-back time is estimated to be 1.4 years. It is therefore showcased that use of a car exhaust heat recovery system, in substitution of the conventional alternator, is a cost-effective approach and a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions per heavy duty vehicle may be achieved. The relevant increase of system efficiency is dependent on animprovement of the efficiency of commercial Thermoelectric Generators, based on new materials and structures and a dedicated design of systematic structure in the case of Rankine Cycle systems, for the harvesting of exhaust heat.© 2016The Authors.

IntroductionTransport is responsible for around a quarter of EU greenhouse gas emissions making it the second biggest greenhouse gas emitting sector after energy. Road transport alone contributes about one-fifth of the EU's total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas. More specifically, Light Duty Vehicles (LDV) –passenger cars and vans – produce around 15% of the EU's emissions of CO2 whereas Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV) – trucks and buses – are responsible for about a quarter of CO2 emissions from road transport in the EU and for some 6% of total EU emissions, CLIMA.In order to reduce these emissions the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union reached an agreement at the end of 2013, regarding two regulatory proposals that will implement mandatory 2020 targets for CO2emissions of new passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles in the European Union. The passenger car standards are 95 g/km of CO2, phasing in for 95% of vehicles in 2020 with 100% compliance in 2021. Reaching these targets will have a powerful impact and create an upsurge in the commercialization of innovative automotive technologies.Moreover, the European Commission is working on a comprehensive strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from HDV in both freight and passenger transport, because despite of considerable improvements in fuel consumption efficiency (i.e. the introduction of turbo-chargers for diesel engines and the development of Hybrid HDVs) in recent years, these emissions are still rising, mainly due to increasing road freight traffic.In light of the aforementioned policy scope the development of vehicle energy-efficient technologies has become a priority for the automotive industry. Both LDVs and HDVs employ Internal Combustion (IC) engines, which produce an amount of energy the majority of which is mainly dissipated in the form of heat through the exhaust gases and the coolant and apart from a small percentage that could be mostly useful to be utilized for cabin heating instead of making use of the more energy consuming A/C, this energy could be recovered and used to improve powertrain efficiency. Fig. 1 shows a typical energy flow path of an internal combustion engine in which only 25% of the fuel combustion is utilized for vehicle operation, whereas about 70% of the total fuel energy dissipates to the environment as heat loss primarily through the vehicle exhaust system and radiator. Fig. 1. Energy flow of an Internal Combustion engine.It has been claimed that conversion of even a 10% of this waste heat into electricity either by a Rankine Cycle (RC) system or by using a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) may result up to 20%in increase of fuel efficiency, Saidur et al. (2012) and consequently in the reduction of emissions. The advantages of using a TEG include negligible systemmaintenance, silent operation, high reliability, and the fact that no moving and complex mechanical parts are involved as compared to a RC system.For HDVs, exhaust gas temperatures range from 200 to 500 °C under real driving conditions, with an average temperature of 440 °C during highway driving. These temperatures can show even further increase during periodical regenerations of diesel particulate filter and other after-treatment devices, Teng et al. (2007). Those high exhaust temperatures provide significant opportunities for an Exhaust Heat Recovery (EHR) system to generate energy for increasing powertrain’s efficiency, Hendricks and Lustbader (2002).1005 Eleni Avaritsioti /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  1003 – 1012 Turbochargers and other recently developed turbo-compounding systems are usually selected for the exhaust waste energy recovery of IC engines. However, as the increase of exhaust back pressure caused by the turbine of theturbocharger or turbo-compounding system, the system efficiency is compromised, compared to a RC EHR system,Weerasinghe and Stobart (2010). On the other hand, as the turbine needs an adequate pressure ratio, the exhaust gas sensible heat absorbed by turbocharger or turbo-compounding system is constrained and the exhaust temperature from the turbine is always still very high and a lot sensible heat remains. This allows an EHR system still, of course, to be fitted downstream even a turbocharger or turbo-compounding system has been installed. An EHR system does not increase the exhaust back pressure.The benefits of using an EHR system on fuel cost and emissions reduction, have been estimated in Europe for passenger cars, Gbegbaje-Das E. (2013) and Ricardo plc (2011). The two reports demonstrate the need for a whole life-cycle CO2 emissions approach to account for environmental impacts. In the US life-cycle analysis of heavy vehicles is being performed since 1998, see for example Gains L. et al. (1998) and OAK RIDGE National Lab (2014),whereas in Europe this type of analysis is rather limited and information is ad-hoc and focused on results produced by individual EU Member States only, Barzaga-Castellanos et al. (2001).In the present work, the average EHR efficiency is estimated by investigating recoverable exhaust sensible heat of a Heavy Duty powertrain. Consequently, the environmental and economic benefits of using EHR techniques are analyzed by considering average vehicle driving conditions.2. EHR efficiency and cost analysis As shown in Fig.2a, a Rankine Cycle EHR (RC-EHR) system comprises of four main components: evaporator/heatexchanger, expander, condenser and circulation pump. With the evaporator/heat exchanger, the working fluid is superheated by absorbing thermal energy provided by the exhaust gas. Flowing out from the evaporator as high temperature steam, the working fluid is driving the expander to produce useful work. The waste steam from the expander is then cooled down through the condenser and returns to liquid form. Finally, the working fluid is pumped to maintain the circulation. It must be noted that the expander is connected mechanically to a generator that chargesthe battery of the vehicle.Fig. 2b shows a TEG EHR (TEG-EHR) system which comprises of three main components: thermoelectric generator, heat coupler to the exhaust pipe and a cooling coupling to the engine cooling tank. The temperature difference between the hot and cold surfaces of TEG induces a current that may be used for the charging of the HDV battery.a bFig. 2 (a) A Rankine Cycle EHR system; (b) a TEG HER system.For most IC engines, there is approximately a 20-40% of total fuel energy, which is dissipated through exhaust gas, the majority of which dissipates as sensible enthalpy due to high exhaust temperature and the rest as chemical enthalpy due to incomplete combustion. To evaluate the amount of energy which can be recovered using an EHR system, it is necessary to obtain the exhaust temperature characteristics under different driving conditions. In the current research, 1006   Eleni Avaritsioti /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  1003 – 1012 the data of a 9.7 liters diesel engine have been selected for the analysis, Wang H., et al. (2015). The exhaust gas temperature variation of that engine as function of engine rpm and torque is shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3. Exhaust gas specifications for a 9.7 lt diesel engine.Assuming that most truck engines today run at around 1500 rpm at cruising speed of 100 Km/h, the exhaust temperature has a mean value of 440 °C (as shown in Fig. 3) and under this condition the EHR system efficiency and recoverable energy amount are examined next.Under these conditions, it is estimated that approximately 3.9% of fuel energy can be recovered by a RC-EHR system. This is equivalent to an approximately 17.5% of fuel consumption reduction, Peng Z. et al. (2013).Similarly, a TEG-HER system for diesel engines, Espinosa N., et al. (2010), incorporating new thermoelectric materials (i.e. p-type tetrahedrites and n-type magnesium silicide) applied to  class 8b trucks (combination tracks, e.g. tractor-trailer, van, bulk tanker, etc) is expected to recover about 4% of fuel energy. This is equivalent to approximately 20% of fuel saving, Harrop P. (2015).Combining the aforementioned EHR efficiency data, a 20% fuel consumption reduction could be an appropriate figure for representing most EHR systems which will be used on HDV.In the context of the current paper, an accurate estimation method of the cost of an Organic Rankine Cycle EHRsystem, has been derived by considering that typical installation costs range from 1,600 to 3,000 Euros per kilowatt, Arvay P. et al. (2011). Although published information on actual installation costs is limited, one recent report suggests that costs could be higher than 4,000 Euros per kilowatt depending on the size of the application, Elson A. et al. (2015).Similarly, with the aim to obtain an accurate estimation of the cost of a TEG-EHR system for HDVs it has been identified that it can range from 1160 Euros per kilowatt (a target cost by Renault Trucks Joint Company-Volvo Group), Aixala L. (2011) to 3600 Euros per kilowatt, Schock H. (2011). Therefore, an approximate cost of 4000 Eurosper kilowatt will be used for the following cost analysis for HDVs, assuming that a 4 kilowatt TEG-EHR system will be installed.Consequently, for both HER systems, (i.e. RC-EHR and TEG-HER), the total cost is assumed to be the same, i.e. a total cost of 16,000 Euros.3. Analysis of Cost and CO2 emissions The economic and environmental benefits of applying an EHR system in HDVs will be analyzed in this section.The pay-back times both for the Cost of Ownership and CO2 emissions of a conventional HDV will be compared with a conventional HDV fitted with EHR system and a Hybrid HDV fitted with EHR system, given that an EHR system can be electrically connected with Hybrid HDV for its work output.1007 Eleni Avaritsioti /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  1003 – 1012 3.1. AssumptionsThe analysis is based on HDVs sold and used in the EU where the average price for a conventional HDV is assumed to be approximately 160,000 Euros in 2015. For a conventional HDV equipped with a 4KW EHR system a cost increase of 10% is estimated (i.e. 16,000 Euros) according to the findings presented in the previous section. For a Hybrid HDV fitted with EHR system, a 30% higher average price is assumed.The annual average cost of vehicles is calculated by including fuel only. Service, annual authority inspection, insurance and tax are assumed to be the same for the three aforementioned HDV types. The fuel cost is based on the average annual mileage for HDVs of 100,000 Km, OAK RIDGE National Lab (2014). Conventional HDVs average fuel consumption is assumed to be 0.5 lt/Km. In the last section of the aforementioned study, it is noted that installation of an EHR on a HDV is expected to result to a 20% reduction in fuel consumption (i.e. 0.4 lt/Km) in the best case scenario and 10% in the worst case one. With regard to the average diesel fuel cost, the average current price 1.15Euros/litre in the European market, is used for the calculations. The average value of embedded CO2 emissions from vehicle production was estimated with the calculation method initially proposed by Berners-Lee (2010). The value of 720 kg CO2 per £1000 car price was replaced by the value published by Ricardo plc of 350 kg CO2 per £1000 car price, Ricardo plc (2011), which implies that  for a car priced £118,000 (=160,000 Euros/1.358) the embedded CO2 emissions are approximately 40,000 Kg. A recent study, however, shows that this figure is further reduced for trucks, Fulton and Miller (2015). Consequently, a figure of 37,000 Kg of embedded CO2 emissions is assumed in this study.3.2. MethodologyThe proposed model for pay-back times for both CO2 emissions and cost of ownership is similar to the ones proposed by a number of researchers: Kloess M. and Muller A. (2011), Al-Alawi M. and Bradley T. (2013), Peng Z., et al. (2013), Next Green Car Ltd (2015). A vehicle’s cost of ownership includes fixed expenses to purchase and own the vehicle and variable costs to use and operate the vehicle such as: acquisition tax, tax on ownership, road tax, maintenance cost, insurance cost, loan cost, fuel cost, etc. From the aforementioned costs the proposed model takes into consideration the cost of ownership and from the variable costs the annual average cost by including fuel only, as suggested by Al-Alawi M. and Bradley T. (2013) in order to reduce model sensitivity. Under these assumptions the equations employed in the proposed model are given next.The cumulative CO2 emissions, referred as CO2 footprint in the literature, can be described as:= + (1)where Scumulative is the cumulative mileage, FC is the fuel consumption (litres/Km), C= ,   is the fuel density = 0.856(kg/litre), xc = 8% is the carbon content of fuel and 44 and 12 are the molecular weights of carbon dioxide and carbon, respectively. These values produce a result for constant C:C =2.73 Kg/lt.The cumulative cost, referred in the literature as Cost of  Ownership, is calculated as:= + (2)where is the fuel price (Euro/lt).Table 1 below, summarizes the values of the main parameters used in the calculations for the optimistic scenario of 20% fuel efficiency (FE) benefit whereas Table 2 refers to fuel efficiency (FE) benefit of 10%, a worst case senario:1008   Eleni Avaritsioti /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  1003 – 1012        Table 1.

ResultsFig. 4, shows that with a fixed fuel price of 1.15 Euro/lt and an annual mileage of 100000 Km, the saving on fuel cost from Hybrid trucks equipped with an EHR system is expected to pay-back the cost increase in 5.5 years, whereas a conventional truck equipped with an EHR system, will pay-back in 1 year when a 20% fuel efficiency is assumed according to Table 1.Fig. 4.

Cost pay-back times for the three powertrain configurations assuming diesel price of 1.25 Euros/lt.It is of interest to take note of the fact that a dramatic increase of the payback time is expected when the annual mileage is reduced from 100000 Km to 30000 Km, as shown in Fig. 6. The saving on fuel cost from Hybrid trucks equipped with an EHR system will pay back the cost increase in 9.5 years, whereas a conventional truck equipped with EHR system payback in 5 years.1500002500003500004500005500000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7Cumulative cost (Euro)YearsCumulative cost vs years(for diesel price 1.25 Euro/lt and 100000Km/year)Cnventional HDVConventional HDV Equipped with EHRHybrid HDV Equipped with EHR1010   Eleni Avaritsioti /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  1003 – 1012 Fig. 7. Cost pay-back times assuming diesel price of 1.15 Euros/lt and the annual mileage is 30,000 Km/year.This analysis indicates that both annual mileage and fuel cost heavily affect the pay-back times.The estimated pay-back times for CO2 emissions, of the three HDVs under study are presented in Figure 7. Both trucks equipped with an EHR system could pay-back CO2 emissions in just 1.4 years. According to the present analysis, in 4 years (i.e. a mileage of 400,000 Km), a conventional truck equipped with an EHR system could save approximately 60,000 Kg of CO2 compared to a Hybrid HDV equipped with an EHR system which shows an average saving of 100,000 Km. This suggests that trucks equipped with EHR are worth developing for cost benefit and carbon emission benefit, in particular for high mileage HDVs.Fig. 8.

CO2 emission pay-back times for the three powertrain configurations (FE 10%).It is important to note that the annual mileage assumed in the analysis (i.e. 100,000 Km) implies a 90% of motorway driving, in which case the fuel saving rate of a Hybrid HDV is decreased due to reduced brake regeneration etc. Situations like that have not been taken into consideration during the aforementioned analysis due to the lack of available data.4. ConclusionsThe recoverable energy by an Exhaust Heat Recovery (EHR) system based on both Rankine Cycle and Thermoelectric Generator was analyzed together with the cost of a 4KW HER for heavy duty vehicles. Finally, the cost and carbon emission pay back times of trucks fitted with EHR system were calculated, assuming fixed fuel pricesand high annual mileage. Service, annual authority inspection, insurance and tax are assumed to be the same for the three aforementioned HDV categories and have not been taken into consideration. From those results, the following conclusions may be derived:a) Considering a fuel efficiency of 20%, an average heavy duty vehicle annual mileage of 100,000 Km and constant fuel price, hybrid trucks equipped with EHR system pay back the cost increase in 5.5 years, whereas a conventional truck equipped with EHR system pays back in 1 year. For carbon emission, trucks equipped with EHR system could pay back in just 1.4 years. However, in the worst case scenario, that the fuel efficiency is only 10%, hybrid trucks equipped with EHR system pay back the cost increase in 6 years, whereas a conventional truck equipped with EHR system pays back in 2 years.b) A dramatic increase in payback time is expected when the annual mileage is reduced from 100,000 Km to 30,000 Km. The saving on fuel consumption of Hybrid trucks equipped with an EHR system will pay- back the cost increase in 9.5 years, whereas a conventional truck equipped with an EHR system will pay back in 5 years, according to the optimistic scenario of 20% fuel efficiency benefit.c) Cumulative CO2 emission pay-back time is expected to increase from 1.3 years for 20% fuel efficiency benefit to 1.5 years for 10% fuel efficiency benefit.d) The method of variable costs of use and operation of the vehicle, while including fuel consumption, provides an adequate result as to the cost of ownership independently from the variations of tax policies in the Member States of the European Union.300001300002300003300004300001 2 3 4Cumulative CO2 emissionsYearsCumulative CO2 emissions  vs yearsConventional HDVConventional HDV Equipped with EHRHybrid HDV Equipped with EHR1012   Eleni Avaritsioti /  Transportation Research Procedia  14 ( 2016 )  1003 – 1012 DisclaimerThe opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author and should in no way be considered to represent an official opinion of the European Commission.ReferencesAixala L., 2011.
