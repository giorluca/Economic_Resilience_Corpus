Substance use disorders, which afflict nearly 8% of the U.S. population,'
exact a devastating human and economic toll. The opioid epidemic has caused
overdose deaths to quadruple since 1999.2 In 2013 alone, the epidemic imposed
an economic burden of over $78.5 billion, including $28.9 billion in spending on
health care and substance abuse treatment. These burdens increasingly fall on
rural and under-resourced areas, particularly in the Appalachian region. The
crisis has evoked a range of policy reforms to prevent addiction, investments in
treatment for sufferers, and lawsuits against purveyors of addictive substances.

WEST VIRGINIA LA WREVIEW
Ultimately, however, society must assist the millions of people in recovery from
substance use disorders to become productive, self-sufficient members of their
communities.
Approximately 10% of Americans are in recovery from substance use
disorders.' They face many obstacles to gainful employment, including stigma,
compromised work histories, employer risk perception, and (in many cases)
records of interaction with the criminal justice system. Substance use disorders
and related criminal records can also prevent people in recovery from obtaining
occupational licenses necessary to become employed or start a business. Such
barriers are compounded for individuals in rural areas, where access to
vocational training, employment, and enterprise incubation services is already
limited.
This essay focuses on legal strategies to expand employment and
entrepreneurship opportunities for persons in recovery. The topic is vital because
economic wellbeing contributes to "recovery capital" - the internal and external
resources that sustain long-term sobriety.' The need for effective legal
interventions is particularly acute in Appalachia, which suffers from a
disproportionate share of both substance use disorder and economic despair. Part
I provides an overview of substance use disorder and the .recovery process. Part
II explores the acute impact of substance use disorder in Appalachia and how the
region's socioeconomic dynamics impede economic reintegration of persons in
recovery. Part III identifies three frequent obstacles to finding employment
experienced by persons in recovery: spotty work histories, stigma, and records
of criminal justice involvement. Part IV addresses opportunities for policy
reform in the areas of employment nondiscrimination, rehabilitative
employment, employer tax incentives, risk management, and the employment
impact of crimes related to substance use disorder. Part V addresses access to
occupational licensing, a crossover concern for individuals interested in
entrepreneurship or employment.

I. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND RECOVERY
Substance use disorders6 are characterized by persistent use of drugs
despite significant adverse physiological, behavioral, and social consequences.7
The diagnosis may apply to use of alcohol, opiates, stimulants, hallucinogens,
inhalants, and several other substances.' There are four general categories of
diagnostic criteria: (1) impaired control over one's use of the drug; (2) social
impairment due to the drug; (3) risky use of the drug; and (4) pharmacological
criteria such as tolerance and withdrawal.' Substance use disorders may be mild,
moderate, or severe, depending on the number of criteria present.10 Sufferers
typically experience changes to their brain structure and function that persist and
produce cravings for the drug long after detoxification." Particularly in severe
cases, this physiological addiction may result in repeated relapses. 12
There are many definitions of recovery from substance use disorder.
These definitions typically include abstinence but may also encompass a range
of other life changes. 13 There is little consensus in the literature as to when
recovery becomes durable and stable.14 More than 60% of people who receive
treatment relapse within one year of being discharged." It can take 4-5 years
before relapse risk drops below 15%, comparable to the general population's
lifetime risk of developing a substance use disorder.'" Generally, sufferers of
serious substance use disorders are encouraged to remain in some form of

treatment for at least one year.17 The Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual refers to "early remission" as the absence of any diagnostic
criteria (other than craving) for at least three months." Sustained remission
means that the individual has not met any of the diagnostic criteria (other than
craving) for a period of 12 months.19 Approximately half of adults with substance
use disorder ultimately attain sustained remission.20
A number of psychosocial factors can impact the odds of recovery,
including supportive relationships, spiritual life, education, and employment. 2 1
One of the most significant prognostic variables is "having something to lose,"
such as employment, social support, or freedom, if relapse occurs. 22 Stable
employment provides a legal source of income, self-esteem, and an opportunity
for social integration among peers who are not using drugs.23 Generating
economic opportunities for persons in recovery can, therefore, reinforce the
recovery process.
II. RECOVERY AND OPPORTUNITY IN APPALACHIA
The Appalachian region suffers from both troubling levels of substance
use disorder and a deficit of opportunity. While Appalachia generally trails the
rest of the country in abuse of most substances, it has disproportionately high
rates of opioid and alcohol use disorder.24 Appalachian men in the prime of their
lives (ages 25-44) are 72-78% more likely to die of an overdose than non-

Appalachian men in the same age group. 25 The mortality rate for Appalachian
women in that age bracket is 92-104% higher than the mortality rate for women
outside Appalachia.26 Opioids caused nearly 69% of all overdose deaths in the
region in 2015.27
Over 40% of Appalachia's 25 million residents live in rural areas,
compared to 20% of all Americans. 28 Rural residents generally have limited
access to recovery resources due to geographic dispersion and resource
constraints. 29 Treatment programs have difficulty achieving economies of
scale.30 Transportation costs and lack of insurance are greater barriers to
treatment in rural areas than in urban ones.3 1 As a result, rural residents are
approximately half as likely to receive treatment as urban residents.3 2
The social and economic structure of Appalachian communities presents
special challenges to the reintegration of persons in recovery. Despite impressive
strides in the past 60 years, Appalachia has higher poverty,3 3 less access to
transportation and communication infrastructure, and less labor force
participation than the rest of the U.S. (due in part to a dearth of rural job
opportunities).34 While Appalachia has traditionally relied on large mining and
manufacturing companies for employment, those businesses and their payrolls
have been shrinking for decades.35 Small businesses, meanwhile, are less likely

than large companies to hire high-risk employees, 36 perhaps because they have
less demand for employees or less capacity to absorb risk. Entrepreneurs in
Appalachia continue to have limited access to debt and equity capital, despite the
expansion of microcredit programs.3 7 Finally, rural areas have higher
"acquaintance density" (i.e., likelihood of familiarity with other community
members)," so employers have greater knowledge of applicants, including their
history of substance use disorder and related legal troubles.
While persons in recovery nationwide face obstacles to economic
opportunity, the socioeconomic characteristics of Appalachia exacerbate these
challenges. The cumulative effects of growing opioid use disorder, geographic
dispersion, and a still-diversifying economy increase the need for effective
policy interventions. This essay's proposals, which address discrimination,
employer risk aversion, and other barriers to economic reentry, have the potential
to empower this vulnerable group of citizens in Appalachia and beyond.
III. OBSTACLES TO EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS iN RECOVERY
People recovering from substance use disorder often have difficulty
finding stable employment due to blemished work histories and pervasive
stigma.39 While former substance use disorder is generally considered a disability
under civil rights laws,40 persons in early stages of recovery have little protection
from discrimination. Finally, many people in recovery have encountered the
criminal justice system, which dramatically increases the likelihood of
joblessness.41 This Section recommends legal and policy reforms to facilitate
second-chance and rehabilitative employment, incentivize hiring, and reduce
employer risk with respect to persons in recovery.

Legal Strategies for Economic Empowerment
A. Flawed Employment Histories
Substance use disorders adversely affect employment.42 Sufferers are
less likely to work, and their jobs are more likely to be temporary and part-time.4 3
Explanations include lower productivity, absenteeism, drug-induced health
problems, and interactions with the criminal justice system.44 Even after attaining
sustained remission, people in recovery may have a higher risk ofjob loss due to
discrimination.45 People in recovery may, therefore, have resume gaps and weak
references, making it harder to obtain gainful employment.
B. Stigma and Discrimination
Substance use disorder is heavily stigmatized in the workplace. A full
78% of Americans tell researchers that they would not be willing to work closely
with an addict.46 Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe that employers should
be permitted to deny employment to persons with a substance use disorder, while
only one quarter of Americans take this position with respect to other mental
illnesses.4 7 Some of this stigma is likely to attach to people in recovery, since
most Americans believe that treatment options are ineffective and nearly 30%
believe that recovery is not possible at all.48 In one study, respondents rated
fictional job applicants with histories of substance abuse significantly lower than
candidates without such histories with respect to qualities such as stability,
reliability, and safety.49
The Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA") prohibits employer
discrimination against any "qualified individual on the basis of disability" in

hiring, compensation, and all other terms of employment.so A disability refers to
"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major
life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being
regarded as having such an impairment. .. ."sI A substance use disorder may
constitute a disability so long as the individual is not currently engaging in the
illegal use of drugs. 2 The ADA expressly offers coverage to abstinent
individuals who are in a supervised treatment program, have completed
treatment, or have otherwise been rehabilitated.53 Thus, an individual who has
recovered from a sufficiently severe54 substance use disorder would come under
the ADA's protection as a person with a "record of... impairment.""
The ADA's protections against employment discrimination are
substantial but not airtight. Employers cannot ask job applicants about
disabilities unless the question is "job-related and consistent with business
necessity."5 They must provide reasonable accommodations to persons with
disabilities who are otherwise qualified for the employment in question, unless
doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. 57 Employers may,
however, verify that employees are no longer using drugs by requiring periodic
drug tests and imposing other behavioral standards."
Two gaps within the ADA's protections may harm the employment
prospects of persons in recovery. First, the ADA does not protect persons in early
recovery stages from termination or the denial of job opportunities. The term
"currently engaging in the illicit use of drugs" is generally construed to
encompass individuals who have used drugs recently enough that the employer
may reasonably believe it remains a problem. 9 For example, the Fourth Circuit
50 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a) (2012).
51 Id. § 12102(1)(A).
52 See id. § 12114(a).
53 Id. § 12114(b).
54 The ADA imposes a severity standard by defining disability as an "impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities." Id. § 12102(l)(A). Major life activities
include activities such as caring for oneself, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking,
communicating, or working. Id § 12102(l)(B). Such disabilities may be episodic so long as they
meet the severity threshold when active. Id. § 12102(4)(D).
5s Id. § 12114(1)(B).
56 Id. § 12112(d)(4)(A).
57 Id § 12112(b)(5)(A).
58 Id. § 12114(b).
5 Interpretive guidance in the regulations provides that "currently engaging" is not intended
to be limited to the use of drugs on the day of, or within a manner of days or weeks before, the
employment action in question. 29 C.F.R. app. § 1630.3 (2012). Rather, the provision is intended
to apply to the illegal use of drugs that has occurred recently enough to indicate that the individual
is actively engaged in such conduct. Id. Similarly, the Conference Report on the ADA states that
the exclusion of current users

may consider drug use current if it occurs "in a periodic fashion during the weeks
and months" prior to the adverse employment action.o Courts assess whether
drug use is current on a case-by-case basis6 I and have denied coverage to
individuals who have been abstinent for three or four months.62 At nine or twelve
months of sobriety, however, courts hold that they are not current users. The
Author has not found case law assessing whether persons who have abstained for
five to eight months are considered current users.
Second, the ADA allows companies to permanently ban from
employment any person who fails a drug test while suffering from a substance
use disorder, even after the individual has successfully rehabilitated. 64 In
Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez,"5 a 25-year employee was forced to resign due to a
positive drug test and reapplied over two years later, after participating in a
recovery self-help program.66 The employer rejected his application per its policy
is intended to ensure that employers may discharge or deny employment to
persons who illegally use drugs on that basis, without fear of being held liable
for discrimination. The provision is not intended to be limited to persons who
use drugs on the day of, or within a matter of days or weeks before, the
employment action in question. Rather, the provision is intended to apply to a
person whose illegal use of drugs occurred recently enough to justify a
reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current .... Employers are
entitled to seek reasonable assurances that no illegal use of drugs is
occurring or has occurred recently enough so that continuing use is a real and
ongoing problem.

of refusing to rehire employees who violated workplace conduct rules.67 In the
subsequent litigation, the Supreme Court deemed the no rehires policy a
"legitimate, nondiscriminatory" penalty for misconduct on the job." In a later
case, the Ninth Circuit extended this reasoning to permit a one-strike policy
against applicants who never held a position in the company.69 Santiago Lopez,
then an addict, was denied a longshoreman position in 1997 after failing a drug
test.7 0 After undergoing treatment and becoming sober, he reapplied in 2004 and
was rejected under the employer's one-strike policy.7' The Ninth Circuit held
that the policy did not facially discriminate against persons with disabilities
because it penalized misconduct engaged in by both disabled and non-disabled
persons.72 The court also found that Lopez had not provided evidence that the
one-strike rule resulted in "fewer recovered drug addicts in Defendant's employ,
as compared to the number of qualified recovered drug addicts in the relevant
labor market." 73 (As the court conceded, providing such evidence would be
challenging given the legal restrictions on inquiring into a person's history of
substance use disorder).7 4 Allowing such permanent bans on employment will
likely foreclose opportunities from many individuals in recovery, particularly
those who work in industries or reside in areas dominated by a few large
companies.

plaintiffs investigator in a lawsuit such as this, even if asked. One of the
primary limitations suffered by individuals recovering from addiction is the
continuing stigma associated with their prior drug and alcohol use.... Thus,
statistical evidence on recovering addicts is, as a practical matter, rarely
available.

C. Criminal Justice Involvement
Substance disorders increase the likelihood of interaction with the
criminal justice system." According to one study, people receiving treatment for
opioid addiction had a 38% rate of arrest within the next two years.7 7
Unsurprisingly, a high proportion of incarcerated individuals meet the diagnostic
criteria for substance use disorder.7 8 People of color have disproportionately high
arrest and conviction rates for drug-related offenses, despite using illicit drugs at
similar levels as whites.79 While drug courts divert a small fraction of offenders
with substance use disorder from incarceration,80 even these comparatively
fortunate individuals may not be able to expunge the charge or conviction from
their record."
A great deal has been written about the collateral consequences of
criminal records, including the widespread denial of employment opportunities
and occupational licenses. 82 Criminal convictions can disqualify one from

employment in the public sector, with government contractors, and in some
regulated industries.8 3 In addition, the vast majority of human resources
managers conduct some sort of background check on prospective hires.
Implications for occupational licensing are discussed in Part V.
IV. REFORMS TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT OF PERSONS IN RECOVERY
Policymakers should leverage the law to promote employment
opportunities for persons in recovery. Opportunities for positive reform include
(1) implementing nondiscrimination provisions to protect persons who have
undergone treatment; (2) relaxing tax rules to facilitate nonprofit rehabilitative
employment programs; (3) reforming the Work Opportunity Tax Credit to
incentivize hiring of persons in recovery; (4) reducing the risk to employers when
they hire persons in recovery; and (5) addressing the collateral consequences of
drug-related convictions.
A. Non-Discrimination Laws
A legislative remedy is necessary to avoid outcomes like in Lopez, where
a rehabilitated individual was categorically barred from employment based on a
failed drug test seven years earlier, when he was not an employee and, therefore,
could not have violated any company policy.8 4 At a minimum, the law should
prohibit employers from enforcing such bans beyond a reasonable interval of
time. A more protective law would cover former employees whose only offense
was a failed drug test, who used the drug in the course of a substance use disorder,
and who obtain a certificate of sustained remission (denoting one year without
symptoms) from a treatment program. In cases where substance use poses a
greater danger to business operations and safety (e.g., heavy machinery
operations), the required interval of remission could perhaps be extended. Such
an extension should not, however, go beyond the time at which the individual's
risk of relapse drops to 15%, the lifetime rate of risk that an individual will
develop substance use disorder. The appropriate policy measure would protect
against discrimination while recognizing the legitimate interests of employers in
enforcing company policies and guaranteeing a drug free workplace.
B. Rehabilitative Employment
As the case law demonstrates, persons in early recovery cannot rely on
nondiscrimination laws to protect their ability to earn a living. One potential

remedy is rehabilitative employment, giving people the opportunity to develop
positive work history and demonstrate their readiness for the workforce. While
charities" are the most likely organizations to absorb the risk involved in
providing this opportunity, current law impedes them from doing so.
In order to retain their tax-exempt status, charities must operate for
primarily educational, charitable, scientific, literary and other similar purposes."
They may not conduct a substantial commercial or other non-exempt activity.87
The IRS evaluates whether an activity is commercial based on all of the attendant
facts and circumstances but consistently finds that the following factors point to
illicit commercial purposes: (1) competing with for-profit entities; (2) pricing
goods and services above cost; (3) accumulating unreasonably large reserves; (4)
"commercial"-seeming promotional and marketing practices; and (5) complete
reliance on earned income rather than grants and donations.
Under this "commerciality" test, a charity may not conduct a commercial
enterprise for the purpose of providing employment to the unemployable."
Charities may, however, conduct vocational training as an educational activity,
and they may temporarily employ beneficiaries in a "commercial" operation as
part of on-the-job vocational training.90 However, such employment may not
extend beyond the period necessary to implement the training curriculum.9 ' This
construct does not allow charities to provide, as a substantial part of their overall
activities, rehabilitative employment to individuals who merely require an
opportunity to prove themselves.
The IRS should recognize that providing transitional employment to
persons in early recovery constitutes a charitable activity by preventing relapse
and facilitating their reentry into the economy. Without repudiating the
commerciality doctrine, the IRS could recognize that charities absorb greater risk
due to these employment practices than commercial ventures would typically
undertake.9 2 For example, the IRS could rule that a charity may provide non-
training rehabilitative employment in an earned-income setting so long as (i) the

participants cannot otherwise obtain employment due to their current or recent
substance use disorder; (ii) the participants constitute virtually the entire staff;
and (iii) the participants engage in regular job-seeking activities. These programs
could thus provide a transition between substance treatment and conventional
employment.
C. Hiring Incentives
Beyond rehabilitative employment by charities, for-profit enterprises
should have an incentive to hire persons in recovery to permanent positions. This
should include reforming how the Work Opportunity Tax Credit ("WOTC"),
designed to encourage employment of at-risk individuals, affects persons in
recovery. The available research, which generally uses the welfare recipient
target group, shows moderate positive effects of the WOTC on employment in
the first year after certification and less effect in the long term.93 Research is
impeded, however, by underutilization of the WOTC by employers.94
Enacted in 1996 as part of comprehensive welfare reform," the WOTC
allows employers to claim a tax credit for hiring disadvantaged veterans, recently
released felons, certain recipients of public assistance (including disability
benefits), people referred from State vocational rehabilitation programs, and
others.96 For most of these targeted groups, the tax credit equals 40% of the
employee's first-year wages,97 provided that the employee works at least 400
hours. For employees who work at least 120 hours but fewer than 400 hours, the
employer may claim only a 25% tax credit.98 However, employers may typically
only count $6,000 in each employee's wages towards the credit,99 capping the
per-employee credit at $2,400.100
The WOTC targets two categories of persons with disabilities: recipients
of disability benefits and participants in vocational rehabilitation programs. In
practice, this excludes many people in recovery. First, the Social Security Act

was amended in 1996 to abolish eligibility for disability benefits on the grounds
of substance use disorder."o' The amended law also prohibits disability benefits
where "alcoholism or drug addiction [is] a contributing factor material" to the
disability determination.10 2 The individual claiming benefits bears the burden of
demonstrating that substance use is not a material factor in the disability-i.e.,
that the disability would persist absent substance use.1 03 Disentangling the
symptoms of substance use and a comorbid mental or physical disability is a
monumentally difficult task, particularly for claimants without access to counsel
or substantial resources.1 0 4 As a result, even otherwise eligible individuals may
be denied disability benefits-and with them, WOTC eligibility-due to their
substance use disorder.
Second, the requirements for vocational rehabilitation ("VR") referrals
create a significant barrier to WOTC eligibility. To be eligible as a VR referral,
an individual must be certified by the State employment security agency'os as (1)
having a physical or mental disability that constitutes or results in a "substantial
handicap to employment," and (2) having completed (or being in the process of
completing) VR services through a state-certified agency, the Ticket to Work
program, or the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs.' 06 This creates a number of
barriers. First, many people in recovery are not eligible for the Ticket to Work
program (available to SSI/SSDI recipients) or veterans' services. Second, VR
services may be time-consuming, inaccessible, or redundant to assistance
provided by treatment facilities or other organizations. In order to begin VR, an
individual must successfully apply for services, 07 wait for services to become
available," and receive an individualized assessment and written plan for

employment.1 09 As a result of these barriers, few people with disabilities have
the WOTC credit claimed for them."'o
Even if a person in recovery is WOTC-eligible, restrictions in the
program may render it ineffectual. The tax credit does not apply to rehires of any
previous employee,"' even if the employee's departure was precipitated by the
same facts that provide the basis for WOTC eligibility (e.g., incarceration,
disability, etc.). The rationale for this rule is likely to prevent employers from
exploiting the WOTC by "churning" employees and repeatedly claiming tax
credits. In regions that rely on a small number of large employers, this rule could
render the WOTC ineffectual for many job seekers.
There are a number. of WOTC reforms that could expand access to
employment for people in recovery. First, individuals in recovery from substance
use disorder should be designated as a targeted group, relieving them from the
need to obtain state-sponsored vocational rehabilitation. Instead, eligibility
should derive from certified completion of a treatment program for substance use
disorder within the past year or other reasonable interval. Second, the prohibition
on tax credits for rehires should be relaxed to allow rehiring of people whose job
loss was caused by substance use or who have been separated from the employer
for a prescribed period of time. This would address the concern about employer
churning without penalizing residents of areas with little economic diversity.
Third, the maximum credit amount should increase, at least for smaller
employers that cannot scale their participation, to compensate for the risk and
costs associated with hiring people in recovery.
D. Employer Risk Reduction
In order to encourage employment of persons in. recovery, the law must
address employer risk management concerns. Employers may fear that a relapse
into substance use will result in poor employee behavior (e.g., absenteeism,
tardiness, bringing illicit substances to the workplace, etc.) or accidents,
imposing costs on the employer and perhaps necessitating a new hire. Employers
may also fear liability to third parties. If an employee causes harm to a third party
while acting in the scope of employment, then the employer is vicariously liable
to the third party.1 12 Even if the employee acted outside the authorized scope of

work, an employer may nevertheless be liable to the injured third party for
negligent hiring, supervision, or retention of the employee." 3 This risk gives
employers good cause to exercise caution in hiring.
The Department of Labor currently administers a program to minimize
the risk to employers of hiring persons in recovery, but its scope is limited. The
Federal Bonding Program ("FBP") provides fidelity bonds to cover workplace
dishonesty (i.e., theft, forgery, embezzlement, and larceny) during the first six
months of employment of certain "at-risk" individuals," 4 including persons who
are in recovery, who have criminal records, or who have been dishonorably
discharged from the military."I The FBP is necessary because insurance policies
for employee dishonesty typically exclude any employee hired or retained by the
employer in knowledge of past dishonest acts.
Job placement agencies (public or private) may purchase packages of
FBP's fidelity bonds with a value of $5,000 each."' They then issue those bonds
to employers at no charge to the employer or job seeker."' Agencies have
discretion to issue up to five bonds per employee, for maximum coverage of
$25,000." If six months elapse without a claim on the employee, the insurer will
make the bond available to purchase by the employer at a regular commercial
rate.'I The FBP is remarkably free of red tape for employers and job seekers.
There are no forms to complete, there are no premiums or deductibles, and the
bonds apply to any full- or part-time job in any state.1 20
The FBP has built-in constraints on its effectiveness. First, the program
only covers employee dishonesty and does not address the other risks and
liabilities that an employee can generate. While employers can and do purchase
insurance to mitigate these risks, each claim can still drive up premiums, cause
employers to pay deductibles, and consume considerable time. Second,
employers may worry about meeting the burden of proof in order to obtain
payout of the FBP bond. The absence of any governing regulations may help to

WEST VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW
minimize red tape, but it also undercuts employer certainty about the process of
redeeming the bond.
In light of these limitations, the FBP should be supplemented with other
measures to reduce employer risk. One possibility is to expand the FBP to cover
employer costs associated with an employee's relapse. If an employee fails a
drug test or leaves work to seek treatment, the FBP could pay out a modest sum
to defray the costs of hiring and training a replacement. This scenario is both
more likely and easier to prove than employee dishonesty.
Another possibility is for states to legislatively limit employer liability
under the common law theories of negligent hiring and retention. For example,
plaintiffs could be barred from recovering in a negligence action against a
business solely on the grounds that the business knowingly hired an employee in
recovery. Alternatively, liability could be statutorily limited, either to a
maximum dollar amount or to the amount of general liability insurance carried
by the employer. A similar construct is used in some jurisdictions to limit the
liability of nonprofits for the acts of their employees and volunteers.121
E. Reducing Collateral Consequences of Crimes
Related to Substance Use Disorder
Finally, a legislative solution is needed to address employment barriers
encountered by persons whose substance use disorder has resulted in law
enforcement involvement. Commentators have urged, and some jurisdictions
have begun to adopt, policies aimed at expanding employment opportunities to
the formerly incarcerated or otherwise justice-involved. Recommendations
include so-called "Ban the Box" laws, which prohibit employers from inquiring
about criminal records in the early stages of hiring; 2 2 laws allowing more liberal
sealing and expungement of criminal records;123 and credentialing regimes
whereby the state can certify an ex-offender's rehabilitation.'2 4 These legal
reforms should take into account the impact of substance use disorder on criminal
121 See, e.g., S.C. CODE ANN. §§ 33-56-180 (2018) 15-78-120 (limiting the liability of charitable
organizations for certain torts of their employees to $300,000 per claimant and $600,000 per
occurrence); D.C. CODE § 29-406.90(d) (2018) (limiting the liability of charities for the conduct of
volunteers to the applicable limits of their insurance coverage).

records. For example, certification and expungement opportunities could become
available earlier for individuals whose record is directly related to their substance
use disorder. Jurisdictions that are reluctant to adopt sweeping legislation in these
areas should carve out narrower provisions for persons with drug offenses related
to substance use disorder.
V. OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING
Occupational licensing, the regime of government-issued authorization
to practice various professions, 125 affects access to entrepreneurship as well as
employment opportunities. Since the 1950s, the percentage of workers required
to have a license has skyrocketed from 5% to 25%.126 Although occupational
licensing theoretically protects the consuming public from incompetent and unfit
professionals, 12 7 a range of commentators have assailed it as an unnecessary and
protectionist barrier to entry. 128 State legislatures have broad discretion to
regulate occupations1 2 9 and licensing requirements span the spectrum of
vocations. In addition to professions like medicine, where credentialing serves a
clear public protection function, licenses are also required to practice low-skill,
low-risk vocations such as makeup artists, florists, barbers, tree trimmers, and
manicurists.130 Because these vocations require relatively little formal training,
they could otherwise provide an accessible path to gainful employment or self-
employment for persons with limited education or financial resources.13 1
Typically, state or local legislation sets forth basic requirements for
licensure and delegates the development of more specific standards to a

profession-specific licensing board. 13 2 Licensure may require educational
credentials, prior practical experience, an examination, and/or verification of
good character.' 33 These requirements often involve fees, disadvantaging
individuals without financial resources.134 Additionally, many states permit the
denial or revocation of occupational licenses based on substance use disorder.
These rules are most common in the health professions"' but affect lower-skill
occupations as well. For example, Tennessee law allows the denial, suspension,
or revocation of a cosmetologist's license based on "addiction to intoxicating
liquors or drugs."'3 6 Likewise, Ohio permits the denial, suspension, or revocation
of a barber's license based on "habitual drunkenness or possession of or
addiction to the use of' any illicit drug.' 37 While it is unclear how often these
rules are invoked, they may deter people from seeking treatment or applying for
licenses when they are in recovery.
Title II of the ADA prohibits exclusion of persons with disabilities from
the services, programs, and activities of a public entity,' 38 including occupational
licensing.' Accordingly, public licensing authorities may not establish
eligibility criteria that "screen out or tend to screen out any individual with a
disability .. . unless such criteria can be shown to be necessary" for the licensing
program.140 Like Title I, Title II also contains an exception for addicted
individuals who are "currently" engaging in the use of illicit drugs.' 4 ' While no
court has addressed the meaning of "currently" in this context, the regulatory
guidance indicates that it should be interpreted to mean "recently enough to
justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current or that continuing
use is a real and ongoing problem." 4 2 As noted previously, this interpretation
operates to remove protection from persons in early recovery.
Occupational licensing laws also frequently disqualify persons with
criminal records, including for minor drug-related offenses. Depending on how

the state's laws are formulated, the license restrictions may apply regardless of
the offense's magnitude, recentness, or relatedness to the occupation. In some
cases, the laws may target arrests that did not result in convictions, or convictions
that have been expunged or sealed. Because substance use disorders correlate
positively with criminal records, many persons in recovery must contend with
these restrictions on licensure. Failure to obtain required licenses can obstruct
them from employment opportunities and prevent them from self-employment
in the relevant fields.
The National Employment Law Project ("NELP") has proposed a model
law framework for occupational licensing with respect to criminal records. 143
This framework draws on guidance from the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission ("EEOC") regarding the use of criminal records in employment
decisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 144 NELP recommends 10
features of fair licensing laws, including (1) the absence of any automatic,
blanket exclusions based on criminal records; (2) limiting criminal inquiries to
job-related convictions; (3) requiring case-by-case assessment based on the
individual and occupation involved; (4) requiring consideration of rehabilitation
and mitigating circumstances; (5) requiring the licensing body to provide the
applicant with notice of the background check and an opportunity to respond;
and (6) prohibiting the licensing agency from performing criminal record
inquiries until they have determined other facets of the applicant's eligibility.145
The last recommendation is designed to lower the risk that the licensing
authorities will discard an otherwise qualified applicant due to bias. 14 6
Where licensing serves a legitimate public safety interest,1 47 the NELP
recommendations offer a reasonable framework to balance consumer protection
with the societal and individual interest in offender rehabilitation. However,

treats individuals differently based on their race, national origin, or other protected characteristic
(e.g., treating white applicants with criminal records more favorably than black applicants with
similar records) violates Title VII, as does use of criminal records in a way that disproportionately
screens out Title VII protected groups. Id.

147 It is the position of this essay that many professional licensing requirements serve little
public purpose and should be abolished. Examining precisely which requirements merit
preservation is beyond the scope of this essay. Licensing requirements that remain in place should
integrate the three elements described here.

licensing law reforms should incorporate additional consideration of persons in
recovery from substance use disorder. First, license exclusion of persons with
substance use disorder should only operate when the disorder has impacted, or is
likely to impact, the person's performance in a way thatjeopardizes public health
or safety. Second, upon certified completion of a supervised treatment program
and/or the passage of a reasonable period of time, individuals who have lost their
license should be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of fitness to carry out their
professions. Third, substance use disorder should be legislatively deemed a
mitigating factor with respect to offenses directly related to that disorder (e.g.,
possession of an illicit drug to which the person is addicted).
The exclusion of individuals from certain occupations based on their
history of substance use disorder or related cri
