Candidate      Principal Supervisor         Page IV   ABSTRACT  The global production of food waste (FW) is of significant economic and environmental concern, having been estimated to produce 8% of globally produced anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and result in the loss of nearly USD1 trillion each year. Consequently, the correct disposal and recovery of value from FWs is a global challenge and responsibility. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a capable technology which can recycle FW to produce renewable energy and recover nutrients. However high capital, operational, and management costs and low value of biogas and digestate lead to questionable economic benefit. As a result, the AD technology heavily relies on subsidies and policy incentives for feasibility. Integration of lactic acid (LA) production technologies into AD could convert the low-value process into a high-value LA-AD biorefinery, reducing reliance on government support  This study aims to address the above by exploring the integration of LA production to AD within the FW context. This involved detailed investigations into the production of LA from FWs, including within the commercial FW context, and integration of FW fermentation for LA into existing AD facilities. Accordingly, following optimisation of LA fermentation, and exploring the feasibility of recovering LA along with its impact on downstream AD, multiple integration scenarios were proposed detailing the potential economic benefits from integrating LA production into FW AD.  The assessment of LA production within the FW context was first explored. For this, LA production within a pre-fermenter at a commercial two-stage FW AD facility was monitored, exploring the impact of environmental conditions, feedstock composition, and operational procedures on LA production performance and stability. Results showed standard operation of the pre-fermenter, favoured the formation of LA leading to LA being the dominant organic acid produced from fermentation. Furthermore, standard operation of the AD facility led to the selective dominance of Lactobacillus, a bacterium commonly associated with LA production. While LA production fluctuated over the monitoring period, the LA concentration was surprisingly stable, especially considering the variation in process variables (pH, temperature, retention time, feed rate, and feed composition). Even so, it was outlined that there would be significant opportunity to     Page V   improve LA production performance, and consequently, economic performance by targeted process optimisation and control. Optimisation of LA fermentation showed the commercially adapted inoculum was capable of high LA yields and selectivities. In addition, the results showed optimal conditions promoted the growth of Lactobacillus, while alternative flanking microorganisms were inhibited. Moreover, optimisation effectively eliminated the conversion of LA to butyrate, allowing the sustained accumulation of LA. Further study of the commercial inoculum showed LA production could be effectively enhanced by supplementing FW with a simple carbohydrate (sucrose) and implementing partial digestate recirculation. While digestate enhanced LA production, it also increased microbial diversity which promoted the production of alternate organic acids. However, the effects of digestate could be effectively controlled through sucrose addition, which promoted the growth of Lactobacillus and inhibited the growth of the flanking community. Following optimisation of fermentation, the feasibility of recovering LA from complex fermentation media and its impact on downstream AD performance was explored. While real commercial broth reduced LA uptake, compared to pure LA solutions, LA was effectively recovered from highly complex fermentation media. Moreover, LA recovery only led to a minor reduction in methane production following the AD of the solid and liquid extraction residues. In this respect, LA production could outweigh the loss in methane production in terms of relative value, indicating the LA-AD biorefinery concept could be commercially attractive. A technoeconomic assessment indeed showed the benefit of integrating LA production into two-stage FW AD, yielding a highly profitable scenario. Furthermore, while integration scenarios were most profitable, Greenfield LA-AD biorefinery scenarios showed significantly higher profitability estimates compared to sole FW AD.  Finally, the insight achieved into different aspects of the LA-AD biorefinery led to a series of recommendations for future research in the context of the FW biorefinery concept.         Page VI   NOTE ON THE THESIS FORMATTING  This thesis is presented as a thesis by publication. It has been divided into nine chapters, three of which contain published work while the other chapters are in late draft form and will be submitted for publication shortly after the submission of the thesis. As some of the thesis consists of independent published work, some repetition of the literature was unavoidable. Prior to each chapter, a short description outlining the contents of that chapter and its role in the research is presented. To maintain consistency between chapters, each published chapter has been formatted to that of the thesis. Table, figure, and equation labels have been renumbered to allow for easy cross reference between chapters if needed with the first number denoting the chapter number, followed by the table number for that chapter (e.g. Table 2.4). The reference style for each chapter has been adjusted to the Chicago style, regardless of which journal the paper was published in, to maintain consistency within the thesis. An individual reference list has been provided for each chapter, which are located at the end of each individual chapter. The supplementary data for each chapter has been added to the end of the thesis as appendices.

Food waste (FW), which is defined as any solid or liquid food intended for human consumption lost along the food supply and consumption chain, is produced in high volumes and tends to grow with population (ARCADIS, 2019; Wolka & Melaku, 2015). The current rate of global FW production has been estimated at 1.3-1.6 billion tonnes per annum which is associated with an economic loss of nearly one trillion USD every year and the production of 8% of globally produced anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Demichelis et al., 2018; FAO, 2021; WBA, 2018). While countries have devised strategies to reduce FW production (ARCADIS, 2019; UN, 2019), the generation of FW along the supply chain is inevitable and treatment methods should aim to reclaim value from this waste stream (Slorach et al., 2019).  Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a mature technology capable of recycling FWs for the production of bioenergy and recovery of nutrients (Edwards et al., 2015). The complex biological process which governs AD is composed of four primary steps, namely, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. Depending on the AD design, these processes may be conducted within a single vessel, or in a two-stage design separating hydrolysis and acidogenesis from acetogenesis and methanogenesis. Compared to the single stage design, two-stage systems have been associated with improved process stability and higher methane yields owing to their capacity to conduct the biological processes at their optimal conditions (Bo & Pin-jing, 2014; De Gioannis et al., 2017). Two-stage AD can play a vital role in renewable energy production and redistribution of nutrients while simultaneously reducing the environmental impacts associated with FW disposal (Chapter 2). Traditional two-stage AD facilities have two traditional financial benefits, biogas or power generation, and fertiliser production. However, due to high construction, operational, and managemental costs, waste treatment with AD can often lead to questionable economic benefit without support from subsidies or policy incentives Chapter 1 – Introduction     Page 2 of 228  (Bastidas-Oyanedel & Schmidt, 2018; Kim et al., 2016). Consequently, the adoption rate of the AD technology varies significantly from country to country where government support differs (Chapter 2). Some AD operations may charge a gate-fee to provide a third revenue source and reduce the reliance on government support. However, this creates uncertainty within AD operations which rely on gate-fees as a major revenue source as many biowastes are suitable for composting, incineration, or animal feed production, creating a competitive market which may undercut AD gate-fees (Edwards et al., 2015). AD may alternatively be considered for utilisation within a larger integrated FW biorefinery, producing various high-value end products, such as lactic acid (LA), from biomass.  LA is a highly versatile building block chemical with a variety of uses within the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries, with recent applications including the production of biodegradable plastics (Lin & Wang, 2007). Recent literature has shown LA production technologies boost the economic viability of AD and reduce the reliance on subsidy support (Bastidas-Oyanedel & Schmidt, 2018; Demichelis et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2016). Whilst these findings are promising, they considered the development of new biorefinery solutions and didn’t consider integration into existing AD infrastructure. Utilisation of existing AD capital would result in significant capital savings associated with an LA-AD biorefinery. However, it is unknown how the standard operation of a commercial AD facility may influence LA production. Various factors, such as fermentation pH, temperature, feed composition, and retention time may not be subject to control, likely naturally fluctuating with surrounding environmental conditions and feed composition. Carbohydrates are the main substrate for LA production, making FW a promising substrate for LA production (Demichelis et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2016). However, FW likely won’t be the sole substrate of an AD facility, and it unknown how varying feed composition may impact LA production. Furthermore, pH depression during LA production is a major barrier to high LA yields and productivities due to the inhibitory effects imposed by the highly acidic conditions (Alves de Oliveira et al., 2018). Optimisation and control of environmental conditions for LA fermentation would likely result in significant improvements to the fermentation process, though the LA production capability of an existing microbial community within the pre-fermenter is unknown. Furthermore, while LA production has been suggested to aide AD economics, it is important to also consider the downstream effects of LA recovery on AD. While valuable, Chapter 1 – Introduction     Page 3 of 228  LA is a substrate for methane formation and its removal will logically reduce the organic load to the digesters. The overall impact of LA recovery on AD has not been explored in literature and is a crucial factor to consider when integrating LA recovery. These questions surrounding the integration of LA production within AD led to the current research project to investigate the feasibility of integrating LA production into existing commercial AD systems aiming to improve process economics.  1.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1.2.1 Lactic acid production at a commercial anaerobic digestion facility How does the operation of a commercial two-stage anaerobic digestion facility impact lactic acid fermentation? – Chapter 3 Efficient LA production requires the strict control of environmental conditions to ensure optimal and consistent production of LA. However, the pre-fermentation stage within two-stage AD may function with limited control, allowing factors such as pH, temperature, hydraulic retention time, and organic loading rate to vary naturally with changing feedstock composition and surrounding environmental conditions. Understanding how natural variation in the complex composition of the waste streams and operating conditions may influence LA production is pivotal to integrating LA production into a mixed FW AD facility. 1.2.2 Lactic acid recovery and the impact on downstream methane yield Can lactic acid be recovered from real fermentation broth and what are the effects on downstream anaerobic digestion performance? – Chapter 6  Adsorption in a promising method for LA recovery and has generally been explored for synthetic broths, broths produced from relatively pure feedstocks, and simple experimental FW broths, but has yet to be explored for a commercial mixed FW broth. The mixed fermented FW broth would resemble the complex composition of future FW biorefineries and it is important to explore the capability adsorption to recover LA from these complex mixtures. Furthermore, while LA can provide an economic benefit to AD, LA is a carbon source for methane formation and its extraction will logically impact the downstream methane yield. Determining the impact of LA recovery on the downstream methane yield can provide valuable data to determine the overall economic impact of LA production on AD economics.  Chapter 1 – Introduction     Page 4 of 228  1.2.3 Lactic acid production capability of industrial inoculum  What is the lactic acid production capacity of the commercially produced anaerobic fermentation inoculum? Can lactic acid production be enhanced with carbohydrate and nitrogen addition? – Chapter 4 and 5 Following monitoring of the industrial pre-fermenter, LA was identified as a major product produced during the uncontrolled fermentation of the commercial FW mixture. It was identified that the limited control of fermentation conditions likely inhibited further LA fermentation of the mixed FW, restricting the LA production potential. The operational pH and temperature are fundamental to LA fermentation, directly controlling the LA yield and production rate. It is important to optimise and control these process variables to maximise LA production and improve process economics.  Following the optimisation of temperature and pH, it was found the industrial inoculum was capable of yields similar to those reported in literature. Due to the limited ability of LA bacteria to secret enzymes to break down complex polysaccharides to simple sugars, FW is naturally limited in its LA production potential. Various reports in literature have aimed to improve LA production by incorporating various chemical, physical, or enzymatic pre-treatment methods. However, these methods are costly and may require the use of complex unit operations. Alternatively, the addition of a simple sugar, such as sucrose, could increase the carbohydrate content of the FW and improve LA fermentation. Furthermore, the supplementation of nitrogen as been associated with improved LA yields from FW fermentation. FW digestate naturally contains elevated ammonium levels and may be suitable as a nitrogen source for LA production while also containing various other nutrients to aide LA production.   1.2.4 Technoeconomic feasibility What is the technoeconomic feasibility of integrating lactic acid fermentation and production into existing two-stage anaerobic digestion? – Chapter 7 Following supplementation of FW with sucrose and assessment of digestate recirculation on fermentation performance, it was found that LA production improved with both sucrose and digestate addition. The optimal supplementation rate of sucrose and digestate were utilised, along with the optimal environmental conditions to conduct a simple Chapter 1 – Introduction     Page 5 of 228  technoeconomic assessment to determine the economic feasibility of integrating LA production into AD.  1.2.5 Research objective The AD of FWs for renewable energy production and recovery of nutrients is currently not economically viable without government support. This is in large part due to the high production and operation costs in combination with the low economic value of traditional AD products (biogas and digestate). Boosting the economic performance of AD through the integration of LA production technologies has been explored for new FW AD solutions but has yet to be considered for existing facilities. Monitoring the performance of and industrial AD pre-fermenter, optimising the conditions for LA production, characterising LA recovery via adsorption with real fermentation broth, and exploring the impact of LA recovery on downstream methane formation would provide valuable data for predicating the economic feasibility of integrating LA production into AD With this is mind, the aim of this thesis was to answer the researcher questions put forward in Section 1.2, and the integration of FW pre-fermentation for LA production is proposed. The results of this thesis are used, together with the results of literature, to conduct a simple technoeconomic assessment to estimate the economic benefits of LA production within existing AD facilities. It should be noted that a high-level approach was taken when conducting the technoeconomic assessment with capital and operational costs extrapolated from literature. A more detailed and accurate technoeconomic assessment is required to gain a more detailed understanding of the impacts of LA production within existing AD facilities, however, the assessment within this thesis provides an initial outline on the feasibility and economic benefits provided from LA production.   1.3 ORGANISATION OF THE THESIS The following thesis is presented as a Thesis by Publication. The thesis itself has been broken down into eight chapters, some with no publications and others containing a single publication. A foreword accompanies each chapter, outlining the significance and objective of the work, and, where necessary, outlines how it relates to the previous chapter. As most of the thesis consists of independent published work, some repetition of the literature was unavoidable, particularly within the introduction sections of each chapter. To maintain consistency within the thesis, table, figure, and equation labels have Chapter 1 – Introduction     Page 6 of 228  been renumbered to allow for easy cross reference between chapters if needed with the first number denoting the chapter number, followed by the table number for that chapter (e.g. Table 2.4 indicates Table 4 in Chapter 2). The text and headings have been formatted to be consistent throughout the thesis. Tables and figures have been placed to give the desired flow and structure and may not be presented in the same location or format (for flow and aesthetics purposes) as they are found in their respective publications. The reference style for each chapter has been adjusted to the Chicago style regardless of which journal the paper was published in to maintain consistency within the thesis.  Every other aspect of the published work has been maintained as it was when published which includes, but not limited to, section, figure, table, and equation order. Any supplementary material published along with chapters has been included at the end of the thesis as appendices and are reference within the text by first stating the relevant appendix and then the table or figure number (e.g. Fig. B5 references Figure 5 in Appendix B). 1.4 REFERENCES Alves de Oliveira, R., Komesu, A., Vaz Rossell, C.E., Maciel Filho, R. 2018.

The primary aim of this review chapter was to determine, firstly, the current state of LA fermentation and how it has been applied to process FWs; secondly, to determine the major factors which influence LA production and recovery from FWs; and thirdly, to understand the current literature surrounding the integration of LA production into AD facilities and the key knowledge gaps to address via the thesis research.  Chapter 2 – Literature Review     Page 9 of 228  2.1 INTRODUCTION:  Food waste (FW) is a relentless problem facing the modern world. Recent estimates have valued the annual 1.3 billion tonnes of globally produced FW at nearly 1 trillion US dollars (Braguglia et al., 2018) and associated 8% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions with its production (WBA, 2018). In an effort to reduce the production of FW, the United Nations have set a goal to halve the production of FW per-capita at the consumer and retail levels by 2030 (UN, 2019). Furthermore, the sustainable treatment of FW falls within multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), including the creation of sustainable production and consumption patterns, and taking action against climate change (UN, 2022). Consequently, the development of sustainable technologies for the recovery of value from this waste stream is becoming a focus point for modern research efforts.  Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a mature technology widely utilised for processing various organic wastes, including FW. In commercial applications, AD is commonly applied for processing large volumes of organic waste for the production of renewable energy  (Comparetti et al., 2013). More recently, researchers have been investigating the applicability of AD on different waste streams, including lignocellulosic biomass, FW, sewage sludge, and animal manure (Carlsson et al., 2012; Mata-Alvarez et al., 2014; Sawatdeenarunat et al., 2015). In reference to the UNSDGs, the application of AD for FW recycling acts on numerous sustainability goals, including the promotion of sustainable agriculture (Goal 2), production of clean energy (Goal 6), development of sustainable cities (Goal 11), ensuring sustainable production and consumption patterns (Goal 12), and combats climate change (Goal 13). However, the low economic value of the standard AD outputs (i.e. biogas and digestate) and high cost of investment, management, and operation limit the feasibility of AD to farm-scale applications unless financial incentives are provided by governments (Gebrezgabher et al., 2010; Massaro et al., 2015). Consequently, there has been a growing body of literature aiming to value-add to the AD technology with additional biorefinery technologies to recover additional high-value products (Chen et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2017; López et al., 2018).  Similar to oil refineries, biorefineries
