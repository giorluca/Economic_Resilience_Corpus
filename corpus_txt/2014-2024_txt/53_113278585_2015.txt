Some energy infrastructure assets have already suffered damage or disruption in services from a variety of climate-related impacts, such as higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more severe weather events. In the absence of concerted action to improve resilience, energy system vulnerabilities pose a threat to America’s national security, energy security, economic well-being, and quality of life.  Building climate change resilience into our energy infrastructure planning is a challenging and complex undertaking. Planning horizons can span several decades (the typical service life of most energy assets), associated investments can extend into the billions of dollars, and relevant technologies can change rapidly. Some climate change impacts may trigger cascading effects on natural resources, energy demand, and supply chains. Challenges are compounded when addressing climate risks at the regional or local level, where climate change projections are subject to less certainty than at the national scale.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has proactively launched numerous initiatives to support and facilitate energy sector climate preparedness and resilience at national, regional, and local levels. In addition to enhancing resilience to climate change, these actions may also have co-benefits that accommodate non-climate resilience needs (e.g., aging infrastructure, cybersecurity, physical attacks, geomagnetic storms). To assist infrastructure owners and utility planners, DOE has compiled this report on region-specific energy vulnerabilities to climate change (see Figure ES-1) and current resilience solutions.  Figure ES-1. Potential climate change impacts on the U.S. energy infrastructure vary by region. Energy subsectors considered most vulnerable to projected climate impacts are listed first for each region.1 1 “Thermoelectric” generally refers to power plants that use a steam turbine to generate electricity. Examples of thermoelectric power plant fuel sources include coal, natural gas, oil, nuclear, biomass, geothermal, and concentrated solar power. “Oil & Gas E&P” refers to upstream oil and gas operations, primarily exploration and production (E&P). “Fuel Transport” refers to movements of energy resources by rail, truck, marine vessel, and pipeline, and it includes associated facilities such as ports, pumping stations, terminals, and storage facilities. Hurricane impacts in Hawaii refer to a projected increase in the frequency of all hurricanes striking the islands, not just intense hurricanes; see Chapter 10 for specific projections. The order of subsector vulnerabilities shown in the figure is based on judgments by the report authors as well as experts from government agencies, national laboratories, and private sector energy companies. Regional Vulnerabilities and Resilience Solutions | Executive Summary ii  Key Climate Impacts and Regional Vulnerabilities Vulnerabilities to climate change vary across regions depending upon the nature of the climate impacts (see text box), the types and age of energy systems present, and the projected combined impacts on operations, energy demand, and energy supply chains. Major energy systems affected by regional climate impacts include the following:   Oil and gas upstream operations are most vulnerable in the Southeast, Southern Great Plains, and Alaska.  Fuel transport in every region is vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts, including increasing heavy precipitation, heat waves, drought, hurricanes, and sea level rise-enhanced storm surge.  Thermoelectric power generation is vulnerable to increasing temperatures and reduced water availability in most regions, particularly in the Midwest, Great Plains, and southern regions.  Hydropower is vulnerable to reduced snowpack, earlier melting, and changes to precipitation patterns, mainly in western regions.  Bioenergy crops in the Midwest and Northern Great Plains may be harmed by higher temperatures and more frequent droughts and floods.   Electric grid operations and infrastructure in every region is vulnerable to a variety of climate impacts, including increasing temperatures, heavy rainfall events, wildfire, hurricanes, and storm surge.  Electricity demand is affected by increasing temperatures and is a key vulnerability in nearly every region. Critical regional vulnerabilities are summarized below. Northwest: Hydropower provides more than 70% of the Northwest's electricity and is an important export to California and Canada (EIA 2014a, EIA 2014b). Warmer temperatures and less mountain snowpack will shift peak streamflow in the region from summer toward spring (BPA 2011, CIG 2009, DOE 2012, Doppelt 2009, USGCRP 2014). Meanwhile, warmer temperatures will likely increase electricity demand for cooling in the summer, when available hydropower generation is reduced (BPA 2011, DOE 2012, DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Warmer and drier summers may also increase the threat of wildfires, which have the potential to disrupt electricity transmission (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014).   Southwest: Many energy systems in the Southwest are already designed for hot and arid conditions, but system reliability is increasingly threatened by higher temperatures, declining water availability, and greater risk of wildfire (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). More frequent and severe heat waves are likely to amplify demand for cooling energy (NOAA 2013, Sathaye et al. 2012, USGCRP 2014). Higher temperatures and reduced water availability may limit the ability of natural gas-fired, coal-fired, and other thermoelectric power plants in the region to meet demand (DOE 2013, Sathaye et al. 2012). Hydropower resources will be affected by reductions in streamflow and shifts in streamflow timing (AEG and Cubed 2005, Cayan et al. 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Electricity transmission lines essential to connecting remote generation assets to demand centers are vulnerable to projected increases in wildfire as forests and shrub lands become drier (DOE 2013, Sathaye et al. 2012, USGCRP 2014).     Key climate impacts projected by region Climate impact Regions with energy systems that are most affected Increasing temperatures and heat waves All regions Increasing heavy downpours Northern regions Decreasing water availability Western and southern regions Increasing wildfire  Western regions Increasing sea level rise and storm surge                       Nearly all coastal regions Increasing frequency of intense hurricanes Gulf and Atlantic regions, including  Puerto Rico Permafrost thaw Alaska  Regional Vulnerabilities and Resilience Solutions | Executive Summary iii  Northern Great Plains: The Northern Great Plains produces coal, crude oil, and biofuel for use across the nation (EIA 2012, EIA 2014c). Delivery is mainly by railroad and pipeline, which are vulnerable to damage or disruption from increasing heavy precipitation events and associated flooding and erosion (USGCRP 2014). Summer heat waves could also damage railroad tracks and are likely to reduce thermoelectric power plant and transmission line capacity (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Higher temperatures could lower the yields of crops used for biofuels while expanding northward the range in which certain biofuel crops (e.g., corn) can be cultivated (NOAA 2013, Roberts and Schlenker 2011, USGCRP 2014). Southern Great Plains: The Southern Great Plains is home to substantial oil and gas production, refining, and transportation assets, with an especially high concentration near the Gulf Coast. Projected increases in the intensity of Atlantic hurricanes and associated rainfall, combined with rising global sea levels and subsiding coastlines, escalate the risk of coastal flooding and wind damage to many of these assets (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014, DOE 2015). Heat waves and higher temperatures are also projected for the region, increasing electricity demand for cooling while reducing the generation capacity of thermoelectric power plants and the transmission capacity of power lines (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Drought and increased competition for water could limit the water available for power plant cooling and oil and gas operations (Cook et al. 2013, DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014).  Midwest: More than 90% of the region’s electricity is generated by coal-fired and other thermoelectric power plants, which are vulnerable to increasing temperatures (DOE 2013, EIA 2013). Warmer temperatures reduce the generation capacity of power plants and the transmission capacity of power lines, while simultaneously increasing electricity demand for cooling (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Energy-related infrastructure, including roads, railroads, and electric grid equipment, may also be at increased risk of damage due to flooding, as heavy precipitation events are projected to occur more frequently (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Increased risk of floods and droughts may disrupt fuel transport on inlands waterways. Changing water availability and increasing temperatures may also affect biofuel production and refining capacity in the Midwest (NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Northeast: The Northeast region is comparatively cool, so as temperatures rise, increased electricity demand for cooling is likely to be driven in part by increasing market penetration of air conditioners (Auffhammer 2011, DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Warmer temperatures and more intense heat waves also reduce the capacity of thermoelectric power plants and electric grid transmission during periods of peak electricity demand (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Sea level rise and storm surge increasingly threaten coastal energy infrastructure, including ports, electric grid equipment, and power plants (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Farther inland, low-lying infrastructure, such as roads, railroads, refineries, and power lines, is vulnerable to more frequent flooding from heavy precipitation events (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014). Southeast: The Southeast, especially the northern Gulf Coast, hosts a large amount of energy infrastructure in low-lying coastal plains that are vulnerable to increases in flooding (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). High winds, coastal erosion, flooding, and large waves from hurricanes and sea level rise-enhanced storm surge threaten oil and gas production, ports, pipelines, refineries, and storage facilities, as well as electricity  Regional Vulnerabilities and Resilience Solutions | Executive Summary iv  generation and transmission assets (DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014, DOE 2015). Higher temperatures and more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting heat waves are also projected for the Southeast, potentially increasing peak electricity demand for cooling while reducing the capacity of the thermoelectric generation and transmission systems needed to meet the increased demand (DOE 2013, NOAA 2013, USGCRP 2014).  Alaska: Northern latitudes, including all of Alaska, are warming faster than temperate regions, and the permafrost underlying much of Alaska's interior and northern coastlines is at risk of thawing (USGCRP 2014). Thawing permafrost causes underlying land to shift and soften. These structural changes can potentially damage the foundations of pipelines as well as roads and airstrips used for fuel shipments to Alaska's remote rural communities (USGCRP 2014). Thawing permafrost and declining sea ice have already accelerated the erosion of coastlines in rural communities, resulting in damaged or destroyed infrastructure for fuel transfer and storage (Alaska AAG 2010, DOE 2013, USGCRP 2014). Warmer temperatures are likely to shorten the season during which ice roads can be used to reach oil and gas operations in the North Slope (DOE 2013). Alaska's extensive energy assets may also be vulnerable to projected increases in wildfire (USGCRP 2014).  Islands: Hawaii and Puerto Rico share many similarities in their energy systems, including reliance on imported petroleum and other fuels. In both of the island regions, projected sea level rise and hurricane-driven storm surge threaten ports and other essential coastal energy infrastructure with flooding, wave damage, and erosion, while hurricane winds pose a danger to structures and power lines (DOE 2013, Murakami et al. 2013, PRCCC 2013, USGCRP 2014). Higher temperatures reduce the efficiency of oil-fired and other thermoelectric power plants, significantly restricting electricity supply if such losses are not offset by reduced demand or supplies added elsewhere in the system (DOE 2013). Other U.S. islands in the Pacific and in the Caribbean are not separately examined in this report but are likely to have climate impacts and resilience solutions similar to those in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Challenges and Opportunities to Accelerate and Expand Resilience  Building a reliable and resilient 21st century U.S. energy sector will require a concerted effort to overcome an array of challenges, including those that are technological and financial, informational and behavioral, institutional, and policy-related. Informational shortcomings, for example, may prevent energy sector owners from making an attractive business case for resilience actions. The public and private sectors are working together to overcome these challenges and better understand the implications of projected climate impacts and the suitability of various resilience solutions.  The private sector, which owns and operates the majority of energy assets, holds central responsibility for identifying  and implementing appropriate measures to ensure the climate resilience of those assets. However, DOE fills an important role by facilitating basic scientific discovery; enhancing research, development, demonstration, and deployment; providing technical information and assistance; designing, analyzing, recommending, and fostering enabling policies; and convening and partnering with stakeholders. As a result, a range of organizations are sharing their experiences, conducting research to identify vulnerabilities and evaluate resilience strategies, and incorporating projected climate impacts into risk management decision making.  While government, academia, and technical institutions continue to provide supporting research, data, and tools, energy system planners, owners, and operators are already identifying vulnerabilities, monitoring resources, investing in resilient technology, and planning for rapid recovery. Continued and expanded efforts by states, localities, and tribes will build regional energy resilience capabilities. This proactive approach will improve access to critical information for decision making and assist in building the body of knowledge required to cope effectively. Smart decisions today will help to provide a robust and resilient energy system for tomorrow. Working together, the private and public sectors can make sure that the United States continues to deliver the reliable, affordable, and increasingly clean power and fuels required to maintain a healthy economy and comfortable standard of living.

The energy sector provides the electricity and fuels that underpin every facet of the economy, including commerce, manufacturing, transportation, communications, health care, water supply and treatment, and other critical infrastructure and systems. The clear potential for disruptions to the energy sector raises concern for normal economic operations and American’s quality of life.  In addition to efforts to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change, the Administration recognizes the importance of adapting to and preparing for climate impacts that can no longer be avoided (see sidebar). This report is part of a broad U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) effort to inform preparedness, resilience planning, and response initiatives (see sidebar on following page).  While this report focuses on resilience to climate change impacts, DOE is also pursuing resilience initiatives that address other energy sector risks not related to climate change (e.g., aging infrastructure, cybersecurity, physica
