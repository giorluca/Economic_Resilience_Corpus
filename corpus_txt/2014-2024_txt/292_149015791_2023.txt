This study focuses on three particular institutions: Kye, theKorean rotating credit association, tanomoshi, the Japanese rotating credit association, andgemach, the Hebrew free loan society. The paper will explore how these institutions developedas alternative economic systems which provided solutions to market imperfections experiencedby ethnic groups. This allowed individuals to start businesses, invest in education, securehousing, and improve overall economic and social well being. There is discussion of theimmigration histories and characteristics of these three groups, as well as the economiclandscape upon arrival, and how it played a role in occupational tendencies and limitingeconomic opportunity. It will highlight the importance of social capital and cohesive ethnicnetworks, as well as the cultural history and values that underpinned the formation of theseinstitutions, which have been culturally transmitted from home country to the United States. Italso calls to attention the dynamic nature of ethnic culture, which is constantly changing andadaptable to new economic and social conditions, and discusses the evolution and subsequentdecline of such institutions. Through an analysis of the Jewish, Japanese, and Korean immigrantcommunities, the paper provides an overview of the historical, economic, social, and culturalfactors that shaped the emergence and evolution of these ethnic institutions.4Table of Contents1.

IntroductionThe United States has always prided itself as a nation of immigrants, from its originalinhabitants who crossed the land bridge from Asia to North America thousands of years ago, tothe countless immigrant groups today who leave their home countries to pursue the Americandream. While the meaning and feasibility of the American dream has changed over time, the goalof establishing a better life for oneself and their family has fueled the various waves ofimmigration to the United States throughout the country’s history. The purpose of this study is tobetter understand the cultures and practices of three immigrant groups that experienced rapideconomic advancement upon entry to America: The mass migration of Eastern European andGerman Jews during the period 1881 to 1924, Japanese immigration to the West Coast from1890 to 1908, and Korean immigration since the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.Such economic success was predicated on the ability to bypass the conventionalassimilation path characterized by low-wage labor, and instead move quickly into commerce andself-employment. Thus, one of the main questions that will be addressed is how first-generationimmigrants in each respective period financed their business ventures in America. To start abusiness and maintain it, a certain level of venture capital is necessary, and it becomes even moredifficult for immigrants who come to the United States with very little, lack a credit history orperhaps even an official immigration status. Therefore, the process of securing start-up capitalwas a key component in one’s ability to achieve economic success. For Jewish immigrants,Hebrew free loan societies played a significant role in securing venture capital for businessdevelopment. Japanese and Korean immigrants employed variations of the rotating creditassociation (RCA) for venture capital accumulation, a practice which has been used by manyethnic communities worldwide. From an economic perspective, I will be utilizing the traditional6institutionalist theory framework of analysis to the capital accumulation techniques of the threeaforementioned ethnic groups upon immigration. This entails a multifaceted understanding of thehistorical, cultural, and economic factors which influence the behavior and performance of ethnicinstitutions. This will result in a better, more full understanding of their relative successes ineconomic and social growth.72. Literature Review2.1 Institutional EconomicsThe Institutionalist tradition puts forward compelling arguments challenging the veryframework Neoclassical economics is built upon. Norwegian-American economist andsociologist Thorstein Veblen was as close as one would consider to being the founder ofinstitutional economics, given the loosely bounded nature of the school. A well-known critic ofcapitalism himself, Veblen inspired many dissident economists in their critique of capitalism,eventually leading to the general formation of institutional thought. One of the most influentialof these individuals was American economist John R. Commons, a major contributor to thepolitical economic tradition in the early 20th century, at a time when reformist prescriptions hada significant effect on public policy, rivaling the orthodox economics. Aligning with theinstitutional emphasis on the understanding of economic issues in their greater social context,Commons saw economics as one facet of an interrelated web of social sciences. The basis ofInstitutional thought lies upon the foundation that market arrangements are socially embedded,and are dependent on supportive (social, legal, financial) structures for their effective operation(Stilwell 2012, 209). In contrast to Neoclassical thought, institutional economists have anevolutionary rather than a mechanistic view of the economy, using Veblen’s theoreticalframework of ceremonial-instrumental value judgements rather than the neoclassical assumptionof a dynamic equilibrium, as a point of reference. Instead of looking at forces that driveequilibration, they study the interactions between social values, technology, and economicinstitutions that influence the evolution of economic society (Stilwell 2012, 210).Sometimes referred to as an “economic sociology”, the tradition prides itself on studyingeconomic issues in their real-world context, embracing the economy’s unquestionable8relationship with social and political matters. Thus, institutional economics adapts historicism toeconomics by teaching that there are no permanent economic truths or static equilibria that canapply for all situations. As Stilwell states in “Political Economy: The Contest of EconomicIdeas”, “It can be seen as exploring the very things that neoclassical economists take as given intheir models - for example, consumers’ tastes, the state of technology, and the ownership ofeconomic resources” (Stilwell 2012, 209).By studying the historical context of each individual country, Institutionalism sought tounderstand the patterns of capitalist development that largely differs across economic institutionsaround the world. Therefore, unlike Marxist and neoclassical theory, there is no unified theory orgeneral explanation that can explain capitalism’s structure and functioning as an economicsystem (Stilwell 2012, 210). It would be much more realistic to look at the diverse economicexperiences of the various capitalist structures by country.2.1.1 What are institutions?:The term “institution” is frequently used across the social sciences but lacks awell-defined meaning. That is why before going any further, it is important to establish whatinstitutional economists have considered to be “institutions” throughout time.Veblen explained institutions as:An institution is of the nature of a usage which has become axiomatic and indispensableby habituation and general acceptance. Its physiological counterpart would presumablybe any one of those habitual addictions that are now attracting the attention of the expertsin sobriety (Veblen 1997, 101).9Institutions become firmly rooted in society, as traditions that people come to accept. Veblencompares this to the concept of habitual addiction, where society becomes addicted toinstitutions in the same way addictions to substances or behaviors come about. As such, peopledepend on institutions, and any change or removal to these habits will be difficult to overcome.Commons observed institutions to be “The processes by which collective action evolves toconstrain, liberate, and expand individual action” (Commons 1970, 35). Society is a “complexsocial organization”, that without an institutionalized set of rules and regulations, would result ininstability and dysfunction of the economy. Institutional constraints limit the power ofindividuals and firms who would otherwise resort to private violence which negatively affectsprivate efficiency and human rights. Wesley C. Mitchell and Walton Hamilton shared similarperceptions of the institution, as “highly standardized social habits … embedded in the habits ofa group or the customs of a people” (Neale 1987, 1178). More recent contributions to thediscipline have included more simplified definitions. Institutions may be defined as a “set ofsocially prescribed patterns of correlated behavior” (Bush 1987, 1076). Sets of institutions residewithin an institutional system, and society is made up of sets of these institutional systems.It is clear that there is no one definition for the concept of institutions, however the underlyingpremise of the ways in which the term has been used, is that “Most of what people do isgoverned by the institutions of their society” (Neale 1987, 1178).2.2 Assimilation Theory and the Segmented Assimilation ApproachThe assimilation theory and segmented-labor market approach are two of the maintheoretical perspectives surrounding the ways in which immigrants achieve economic and socialmobility and how they are constrained. It is important to introduce both of these two theoretical10frameworks, as the paper will be utilizing the segmented assimilation approach in its analysis ofethnic business and institutions.2.2.1 Assimilation TheoryThe assimilation perspective dates back to the Chicago School in the 1920’s, with morerecent representations in the work of sociologists like Milton Gordon, Richard Alba, and VictorNee. The theory is based on the sequential path of particular immigrant groups, from “initialeconomic hardship and discrimination”, to “eventual socioeconomic mobility arising fromincreasing knowledge of American culture and acceptance by the host society” (Portes andManning 1986, 47). It assumes that assimilation and acculturation is a necessary part of theprocess of achieving socioeconomic mobility for immigrant groups and their followinggenerations. Therefore, a devolution of one’s previous ethnic identity is expected, to give up their“backwards” way of life and embody new characteristics that allows them equal access andmakes themselves more acceptable to the “opportunity structure” of the host society (Portes andManning 1986, 48). Much of the literature surrounding the study of immigrant groups is writtenfrom the assimilation perspective.2.2.2 Segmented AssimilationThe segmented assimilation approach critiques the prior perspective, arguing that there isno one single assimilation path for subsequent generations of immigrant groups. The approachasks the important question of why some immigrant groups experience downwardssocioeconomic mobility in subsequent generations, while others experience socioeconomicprosperity. Sociologists have put forward various frameworks and theories in an attempt tocategorize the different types of immigrant flows and their distinct processes of adaptation. The11segmented assimilation approach observes the various sectors of American society that aparticular immigrant group assimilates into, and identifies distinct modes of incorporation thatare chosen. The following four modes of incorporation were proposed by Alejandro Portes andRobert D. Manning in their study titled, The Immigrant Enclave: Theory and EmpiricalExamples, and will be used in this paper as a comparison and point of reference when assessingimmigrant paths. The ethnic enclave, the middleman minority, primary sector immigration, andthe political refugee. These diverging assimilation paths represent the experiences from differentimmigrant groups, who face different sets of obstacles in assimilation, ranging from class,economic status, and race to geographical location and educational opportunity.2.2.2.1 Ethnic EnclavePortes and Manning explain ethnic enclaves as highly concentrated spatially identifiableareas where a certain ethnic group is socially and economically distinct from the greater society.Enclaves are located in physically concentrated geographic locations, where work, education,healthcare, recreation and any other service is within proximity. In a fully developed enclaveeconomy, one could live their entire life within the confines of the community. Within theenclave is a social mechanism that fosters strong community reciprocity and solidarity, whereone’s success is supported by the community, with the expectation that they will give back aswell (Portes and Manning 1986, 62). At times, this has proven to be a very successful way fornew immigrants to advance economically, even with limited knowledge of the country’slanguage and culture (Portes and Manning 1986, 64). Members of the community only learn themost important aspects of the new culture required for economic advancement. Aside from that,there is a close adherence to original language, religion, and values.122.2.2.2 Middleman MinoritiesMiddleman minorities consist of small groups of immigrants that inject themselves as“commercial intermediaries” in a particular country/region, and often differ in nationality,culture, and race, to the population they cater to (Portes and Manning 1986, 50). The concept ofmiddleman minorities is a similar mode of incorporation to the ethnic enclave. However, thereare several structural differences between the two. Middleman minorities are exclusivelycommercial, as mediators of commercial and financial transactions between the superordinateand subordinate classes. Unlike enclave businesses that often have problematic relationships tothe established native ones, middleman groups fill positions that are more complementary orsubordinate to the local “owning class” (Portes and Manning 1986, 63). An example of themiddleman minority are Jewish, Korean, and other Asian-American merchants found in theinner-city. They occupy economic niches that are often feared by others, such as corner storesand laundromats. By nature, the middleman minorities are dispersed amongst populations, andcannot necessarily be traced back to established areas.2.2.2.3 Primary Sector ImmigrationPrimary sector immigration has also been a successful form of integration. Without asupporting ethnic community, immigrants must quickly become fluent in the new language andculture, following the traditional customs of career mobility and promotion laid out by the hostcountry (Portes and Manning 1986, 64). Unlike other modes of incorporation where immigrantspick up on the local language and culture of the surrounding area, primary sector immigrantprofessionals may experience an erosion of past culture and less of an attachment to anyparticular community (Portes and Manning 1986, 64).132.2.2.4 Political RefugeeWhile the existence of political refugees does not itself create a distinct adaptation path, itis important to differentiate their experience from that of purely economic immigrants. Politicalrefugees come from a wide variety of backgrounds, having immigrated primarily fromCommunist-controlled countries to the United States. First was after the occupation of EasternEurope by Soviet forces, there was also the arrival of Fidel Castro in Cuba, and also those whocame in the wake of the Vietnam War (Portes and Manning 1986, 50). Refugees have beenobserved to enter many different lines of work, from low-wage secondary labor to the creation ofmulti-million dollar enterprises. Similarly, they have been observed in many different modes ofincorporation, including the three modes previously mentioned.2.3 Social CapitalThe concept of social capital will be used in this paper as an important facet of thecultural approach to analyzing ethnic groups and their institutions. Social capital, as we mostcommonly refer to today, is the ability to obtain resources through membership in various socialnetworks or larger social structures (Portes and Landolt 532). Economist Michael Woolcockexplains the concept of social capital, as one’s family, friends, and associates, who collectivelyform an important asset. These are people that can be utilized during a difficult situation,appreciated for its intrinsic value, and/or exploited for practical benefits (Woolcock 2001, 3).Social capital can manifest itself in various ways, such as securing a competitive job throughpersonal connection with a senior, helping your child with their homework, or simplyexperiencing the fulfillment of engaging with friends, contributing to community projects, or14participating in religious events. However, when some individuals have such connections andothers don’t, it often leads to nepotism, discrimination, and even corruption, on both individualand institutional levels.At the same time, the absence of social capital has its own implications. Whenconsidering social capital with respect to inequality, Woolcock elaborates that communities whoare “endowed with a rich stock of social networks and civic associations will be in a strongerposition to confront poverty and vulnerability, resolve disputes, and/or take advantage of newopportunities” (Woolcock 2001, 3). As such, a characteristic of those who are impoverished, isthe lack of membership, or even exclusion from specific social networks and institutions. Theseare connections which could have been leveraged to secure quality employment and adequatehousing, effectively acting as an “informal insurance mechanism” which provides direct andindirect financial support (Woolcock 2001, 4).There is a common inclination to conflate the ability to secure resources through socialnetworks with the resources themselves. Under this assumption, the presence of social capital isconnected to positive outcomes, while negative outcomes indicate an absence of social capital. Inreality, one’s ability to secure resources through social connections in no way assures a positiveoutcome. Furthermore, when considering the unequal distribution of wealth and resources insociety, some groups may have strong trust and solidarity within but will still experience limitedaccess to quality resources (Portes and Landolt 2000, 532).Prior to the 1990s, the dominant development theories had limited perspective on thesignificance of social relationships in economic development. Social relationships were seen as ahindrance to development, as well as a tool used by corporate and political elites as a primarymechanism of capitalist exploitation (Woolcock 18). There was a focus on the strategic decisions15of rational individuals acting under time, budgetary, and legal constraints, where groupsprimarily existed to minimize transaction costs of exchange, emerging in the optimal size andcombination given undistorted market signals (Woolcock 19). This neoclassical and exclusivelyeconomic approach to development has led to growing income disparities and has beeninsufficient in explaining the success in development for some groups, and the failures for others.Ultimately, such theories failed to acknowledge the potential of mutually beneficial relationshipsbetween workers and owners, and the variation in developmental progress achieved by emerginggroups. Social capital literature has proven to be an integral part of the investigation intoinstitutions and communities in development.2.4 Rotating Credit Associations, Loan AssociationsThis paper will look into two ethnic financing institutions which have proven to beessential for businesses financing in a number of ethnic groups: (1) the rotating credit associationand (2) the loan association.2.4.1 The Rotating Savings and Credit Associations (ROSCA)The rotating savings and credit association (term is interchangeable with rotating creditassociation), is a cooperative informal financial system found in communities across the world.While its exact functions and practices vary from place to place, all roscas share a commonpurpose of providing goods or benefits that are missing or under-provided in the community.Roscas have three interrelated functions, the first, acting as an economic institution, through thesaving, credit, and insurance functions it provides. The second, as a social institution, serving asa social meeting place, a source of social aid, and a method of bolstering savings when saving is16otherwise difficult. Finally, the third function is as a cultural institution, as each rosca is designedto be specifically tailored to the needs of the culture it resides in (Sandsør 2010).2.4.1.1 How Roscas WorkSo how do roscas work? Each cycle (can be weekly/monthly/yearly), members pool theirmoney into a common fund, and after a predetermined period, they receive a lump sum when itis their turn in the rotation (Ashe and Wilson 2019, 5). A variety of factors, such as geographicdistance, income levels, timing of income, workday demands, bus schedules, and availability ofmeeting space, are considered when deciding when, where, and how often to meet, as well as thevalue of the contribution For example, imagine there are four participants who meet once amonth for four months, and each contribute one hundred dollars to the pot at each meeting. Afterthe first month, the pot will be at four hundred dollars, and that money goes to one of theparticipants each month, until all participants have contributed and received four hundred dollars.This marks the end of the rotation, and the group can decide to continue the rotation or stop itthere. Figure 1 below illustrates this practice. The internal structure of roscas makes it so thatreciprocity is a key element in functioning properly. There is a mutual understanding thateveryone must contribute to the pot throughout the entire rotation to receive the full payout(Sandsør 2010).17Figure 1Figure 1. Example of a functioning rotating savings and credit association. Lateefapp.com, Apr.2023, https://lateefapp.com.A successful RoSCA requires a close-knit community. There is a high level of mutualaccountability that each member must hold themselves to. Members need to trust that payoutswill arrive on time, and in the correct amount. To lessen the risk posed by new members,organizers create rules for entry. Oftentimes, new members must be relatives or coworkers withexisting members. They will also have to “build” their credit, as the last ones to receive theirpayouts for the first couple of payment cycles (Ashe and Wilson 2019, 6). Members who bringin new members may even be responsible for the payments of the sponsored member for a trialperiod. Though there are no legal repercussions if a member fails to make their payment,community is valued highly, so the worry of social disapproval and the resulting loss of socialstanding is often more than enough of a deterrent. Furthermore, access to these groups is basedlargely on local connections, as well as one’s existing reputation in the community (Ashe andWilson 2019, 6).182.4.1.2 Roscas as an Economic InstitutionThe way roscas serve as an economic institution is straightforward. Participants arelooking for a way to save in a consistent manner, they want to borrow money at a reasonablecost, and they want to be able to use roscas as a form of insurance which covers unexpectedcosts. When participants reach their turn in the rotation, they are given the opportunity to saveadditional money that they would have otherwise not had access to. However, once participantshave received the pot, they are now indebted to the other members for the remainder of therotation (Sandsør 2010). While earlier recipients may benefit from the larger payout in relation topot contributions, later recipients benefit from the element of insurance that waiting provides. Atthe same time, the flexibility of roscas to change the orders of the rotation when participantsexperience unforeseen circumstances, also acts as a form of insurance. Of course, changing theorder requires cooperation with the member next in line and the member experiencing theunexpected income loss. However, as discussed, such a situation will likely not be a problem, asroscas are built upon a strong foundation of social and cultural ties, which allows the institutionto function properly (Sandsør 2010).In many cases, households rely on the incomes of several family members, and incomestreams are often unpredictable from month to month. So, in many ways having this financialbuffer can be life changing: it gives families a regular, more predictable form of income, andallows for unforeseen expenses such as health care, car repairs, rent, or illness, to be less of afinancial burden. When household income within RoSCA groups begins to grow and becomemore stable, members start to contribute more, and with longer durations of payouts measured.These larger payouts allow members to achieve longer-term goals, such as opening a business,19paying for their children’s education, or building equity through a down payment on a home(Ashe and Wilson 2019, 5).2.4.1.3 Roscas as a Social and Cultural InstitutionOn top of the economic aspects of roscas, there are also social and cultural benefits toparticipation. At the most fundamental level, for many people, it is difficult to save alone. Roscasprovide a savings structure, forcing individuals to contribute regularly even when they feel likeprocrastinating. Roscas can also create tight social and cultural circles, where meetings can act asa financial gathering, a social event, and/or an opportunity to celebrate ethnic festivals (Ashe andWilson 2019, 6). Members can eat, drink, network, and discuss financial goals. They mayprovide assistance and advice to other peers who are starting or purchasing a business or go intobusiness together with other members. It provides a sense of community and expands theparticipants' network of connections. Oftentimes, roscas will collect additional funds on top ofthe pot contributions made each meeting. This acts as an emergency fund which can bedistributed to any member in need. There is a collective understanding among participants thateach individual is willing to offer this social aid.203. The Institutional Approach to Ethnic Business Development3.1 Culturalism vs. Contextualism vs. Orthodox EconomicsBefore going deeper into the institutional approach with regard to ethnic businessdevelopment, it is important to review the contributions of existing literature which pulls fromvarious approaches of analysis. Later in this chapter, I will then introduce the institutionalapproach, the method of analysis I will be employing in hopes of providing a comprehensiveoverview of Jewish, Japanese, and Korean capital accumulation practices upon immigration tothe United States.3.1.1 The Orthodox Explanation (Economic Efficiency)On the topic of racial and ethnic makeup in the labor market, the orthodox economicsexplanation is based on the concept that in an efficient market, in the long run, it is impossiblefor racial discrimination to remain, because of its negative effects on profits. Discrimination isthus a short-term phenomenon, “arising from the tradeoff between profit and the utility derivedfrom employers exercising the taste for discrimination” (Naylor 1994, 178). Others have usedstatistical discrimination models as an explanation, where race is used as a screening device: Paygaps between White and Black represent the risk averse tendencies of White employers favoringWhite employees who have a less dispersed distribution of abilities, resulting in lower demandfor Blacks and lower wages. This phenomenon carries over to ethnic small-business, wheresuppliers of start-up capital will have similar risk-averse tendencies when considering lending todifferent ethnic groups (Ibrahim and Galt 2003, 1110). However, there is no doubt that long-termmarket discrimination persists to this day. Many ethnic minorities will have legitimate structuralbarriers to entry in the primary labor market, and discrimination plays a big role.21Human capital determinants such as schooling, education, and other traits that determineproductivity, have also been cited in orthodox economics when addressing the ethnic success andfailure question. However, time and time again, it has been proven that human capitaldeterminants alone do not explain the differences in economic success between ethnic groups(Ibrahim and Galt 2003, 1110). It is a historical approach that fails to acknowledge the varyingclass backgrounds and socio-economic environments that exist among the larger ethnic group.3.1.2 The Cultural ApproachWhen observing the differing tendencies of various ethnic groups in business practices,culture is often used as an explanation for a group’s success or failure. With this understanding,there are certain value systems, religions, and methods of social organization which foster moreentrepreneurial spirit (Ibrahim and Galt 2003, 1108). The economic success of Asians are oftenattributed to positive orientations towards hard work and education, while the lack of success forgroups like Mexican-Americans may be explained by a culture that discourages financialplanning and delayed gratification. The Jewish success in businesses has often been linked toJewish religious teachings, similar to the connection of Irish political activity in America andprevious political experience in Ireland (Tenenbaum 1989, 212). In essence, cultural analysiscorrelates ethnic success and failure to ethnic values, where groups that arrive with valuesconducive to success have an easier time economically progressing than the groups who do notvalue the capitalist mentality.Culturalists also view communities that experience success as a result of the social capital(see 2.3) generated by social institutions, networks, and cultural norms, which can come in theform of employees, local customers, and sources of financing. These close-knit social networks22facilitate the hiring of workers, securing of venture capital, and the exchange of informationwhich is all built on the foundation of mutual trust within members of the community. Many ofthese ethnic businesses are found in ethnic enclaves (see 2.2.2.1), where the goods transacted areprimarily consumed by co-ethnics, and also in middleman minority businesses (see 2.2.2.2),catering to niche markets, often in undesirable locations that require low start-up costs (Portesand Manning 1986).3.1.3 The Contextual ApproachIn contrast to the cultural interpretation which places heavy emphasis on the concept ofethnic group behavior being based on cultural traits brought from their country of origin, thecontextual approach explains ethnic group behavior as a result of immigrants’ responses to theirnew societies (Tenenbaum 1989, 211). This takes into account the existing economic andpolitical structures upon immigrant arrival, and the opportunities and/or limitations it provides.The idea of ethnicity has much less to do with one’s cultural background from their country oforigin, than the ethnicity that emerges given the structural conditions which exist at any givenpoint in time (Yancey, Ericksen, and Juliani 1976, 392). These structural conditions whichinfluence ethnic and community behavior can be found in the relationship between the ethniccommunity and the larger society, where there are identifiable constraints of occupation,residence, and institutional affiliation. To understand the occupational tendencies of immigrants,it is important to consider not just the different educational and occupational skills ofimmigrants, but also the specific working opportunities which were available in theircircumstance. Similarity in occupation brings about similarities in lifestyle, class interests, workrelationships, and residential areas, which all facilitate the development of ethnic communities23and group consciousness. As Yancey, Ericksen, and Juliani hypothesize, “It is basically amanifestation of the way populations are organized in terms of interaction patterns, institutions,personal values, attitudes, lifestyles and presumed consciousness of kind” (Yancey, Ericksen, andJuliani 1976, 400). Therefore, it would be incorrect to identify common heritage as the keyfeature of ethnicity. The typical behaviors and characteristics that are often linked to historicalethnic tendencies considered to be constant and inherited from the past, are largely influenced bythe circumstances in which ethnic groups are situated, and are the result of an ongoing processthat continues to progress.3.2 The Institutional ApproachThe three aforementioned approaches were somewhat accurate in their identification ofcultural, historical, and economic actors that influence behavior within ethnic groups. However,they fall short of explaining the full picture, each putting forward only partial explanations basedon their one focus of study. The traditional institutional school offers a more comprehensive,integrated study, as an evolutionary, path-dependent approach which understands that the studyof any organization can only be understood within the context of its particular socioeconomicsystem. It seeks to assemble the cultural, contextual, and economic factors together, to tell theentire story. Instead of the pre-established, static conditions which culturalists and orthodoxeconomists tend to emphasize, the institutional approach opts for a more dynamic, ever-changingunderstanding of economic and socio-cultural influences (Ibrahim and Galt 2003, 1115). Thetraditions, organizations, and other formal and informal institutions which shape the behavior ofindividuals are as Ibrahim and Galt explains, “in a permanent process of variation that changesinstitutions themselves, and therefore, the conditions under which individuals act”.24An ethnic group’s need to survive, as well as the structure of opportunity provided upon arrival isjust as important to consider as their existing culture brought to America.So how will the institutional approach bring together the cultural, contextual, andeconomic analysis? There is certainly value to be found in each of these perspectives. Forexample, it would be wrong to assume that cultural values or human capital determinants, alone,explain the economic differences between ethnic groups. However, what the following chapterswill show is that it is still important to consider the prior levels of educational and occupationalattainment of immigrants as well as the cultural histories of ethnic loan institutions firstdeveloped in the country of origin. Discrimination will also prove to be an important factor, aswell as different ethnic group’s reasons for immigrating in the first place. Economic opportunityat the time of arrival is also important to consider, with the understanding that opportunities foroccupational advancement vary based on the state of the greater economy. Ultimately, it must bekept in mind that there is no one explanation for an immigrant group’s overall success. In thisessay, I will utilize these cultural, contextual, and economic frameworks to investigate thedevelopment of two particular ethnic institutions: (1) the loan society and (2) the rotating creditassociation.254. Historical4.1 Jewish Immigration 1881-1924The first Jewish community was established in 1654 in the Dutch colony of NewAmsterdam, located where New York City is today. They were Sephardic Jews fleeing thePortuguese Inquisition that had taken over the Dutch colony in Brazil (Chiswick 2009, 6). Laterin the American colonial period, small numbers of Sephardic and German Jews began to inhabiteast coast seaport cities. Jewish immigrants were often shopkeepers, merchants, and shippers inthese seaport cities. There were very few that were farmers or laborers, as many Jewishimmigrants at the time possessed literacy and numeracy, which allowed them to have higherpaying occupations (Chiswick 2009, 7).The second wave of Jewish immigration (1840-1870) closely preceded the massmigration period of 1881-1924 and was composed mainly of German-speaking Jews fromCentral Europe. The immigration was prompted by political and economic tensions related to therestructuring of economies and industrial recessions in Central Europe (Chiswick 2009, 7). Justas they had done in Europe, the German Jews mostly operated in retail trade, and many becamepeddlers or opened small retail establishments upon arrival to the United States (Chiswick 2009,8). In fact, some of the most well-known department stores, such as Bloomingdales, Saks, andNieman-Marcus, were founded by German Jewish merchants.The third wave was a mass migration of Jews who immigrated from Eastern Europe andthe Russian Empire from 1881 to 1924, after the easing of US immigration restrictions fromthese regions. Increasingly discriminatory policies as well as a growing population forcedgeographical and occupational changes for Eastern European Jewish communities. As jobsshifted from trade and personal services toward crafts and industrial factory employment, Jews26made the decision to migrate from rural to urban areas, from depressed to industrialized areas, orto migrate abroad, the most popular landing spot being the United States. They make up asignificant portion of the American Jewish population today. Table 1 maps the estimatedAmerican Jewish population from 1818, at 3,000 people to 1910, where over two million Jewswere estimated to be residing in the United States. Within the larger mass migration of Europeanpeoples in this period, Jewish immigrants represented just over 2 million of the 23 million thathad moved to the United States (Gartner 1986, 54). Of the roughly 2 million Jews living in theUnited States by 1914, 1.4 million resided in New York City. Of those 1.4 million Jews, 450,000resided in the two square miles that make up Manhattan’s Lower East Side (Gartner 1986, 56).Unlike the earlier population of Colonial Jews who tended to stay in eastern seaports, and theGerman Jewish immigrants that dispersed themselves in all sorts of towns and cities, the EasternEuropean and Russian Empire Jews were concentrated in major industrial cities (Chiswick 2009,9).Table 1:27Table 1. US Census and American Jewish Yearbook estimate of the number of Jews living in theUnited States 1818-1910. “JEWISH STATISTICS.” 1911. The American Jewish Yearbook12:277-280. https://www.jstor.org/stable/23600640.Like the two waves of Jewish immigrants that came before, self-employment remainedthe most common occupation for Eastern European and Russian Empire Jewish immigrants.They went into light manufacturing and retail trade as the main industrial sectors (Chiswick2009, 4). Prior to their arrival in the United States, over 60% of Jewish immigrants who arrivedfrom 1899-1914 worked in manufacturing jobs, a characteristic of the Jewish occupationalstructure in Eastern Europe, which is reflective of the disproportionate concentration ofAmerican Jewish immigrants in the clothing industry (Kahan 1978, 237). More than half of theJewish immigrant workers in textiles and clothing in the United States had previous workingexperience in the field. During this period, most of the Jewish immigrants in clothing industryjobs were working for Jewish entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs benefited from the savings of nothaving to give on-the-job training, and the immigrants benefited from a stable income and theco-ethnic community that came with such employment. New Jewish immigrants with a lack ofEnglish proficiency were able to secure relatively solid employment and begin saving andlearning the necessary skills for their own self-employment endeavors.It is also interesting to mention the Industrial Removal Office (IRO), a program lastingfrom 1900 until the 1920’s, that was meant to relocate primarily young, Jewish immigrantsexperiencing economic difficulties and poor living conditions. As Jewish immigration continuedto concentrate in particular neighborhoods, Jewish individuals and households began to look tothe greater United States as potential relocation opportunities. Overcrowding, crime, and poor28health conditions became a large issue in areas such as the Lower East Side, which promptedvarious Jewish service organizations such as B’nai B’rith, United Hebrew Charities, and theBaron De Hirsch fund, to create the Industrial Removal Office to address some of these issues(Abramitzky, Boustan, and Connor 2020, 7). Over the course of the program, over 39,000households were relocated, 79% being men, who mostly moved alone, at an average age of 28.IRO participants were dispersed throughout more than 1,000 different locations in the UnitedStates, from small communities like Gary, Indiana and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to larger cities likeCleveland, St. Louis, and Chicago. Prior to relocation, IRO participants were earning 18% lessthan comparison households. However, in just a decade after removal, IRO participants gained23% more in occupation-based earnings than comparison households (Abramitzky, Boustan, andConnor 2020, 18).Discrimination also played a role in the life of American Jews in the Gilded Age andProgressive Era, as they were perceived as “bizarre and unkempt”, just like the influx of otherimmigrants at the time (Higham 1957, 14). Jews were limited and discriminated against inhousing, employment, access to private higher education, and places of leisure and socializing.There was residential segregation of Eastern European Jews in concentrated ghetto areas, as wellas discrimination in summer resorts, clubs, and private schools. By the early twenties, strongnationalism stemming from the First World War began to criticize Jews for maintaining aseclusive solidarity, instead of becoming “America First”. The strong ambition and success ofJews in climbing the economic ladder pushed the wrong buttons for many native Americans inmiddle class society, who feared this inundation (Higham 1957, 19).294.2 Japanese Immigration 1890-1908The Meiji Restoration in 1868 marked a period of rapid urbanization and industrializationin Japan. However, this also brought about high levels of social disruption and agriculturaldecline, as farmers were forced to leave their land and workers were left jobless by foreigncompetition (Modell 1971, 165). As a result, many Japanese saw the booming U.S. economy asthe place to be, and thus immigration began in the West Coast. Figure 2 paints a picture of totalJapanese immigration in this period. Early immigrants came illegally as contract laborers,however by the 1880s, emigration legislations began to ease and gave way to 300,000 Japanesemen and women up until the “Gentlemen’s Agreement” of 1908 (Modell 1971, 165). Amidstgrowing tensions between Japanese immigrants and Americans, this informal agreement betweenthe Japanese and United States governments denied emigration passports to Japanese laborers,while still allowing wives, children, and parents of current immigrants to enter the United States.In exchange, President Theodore Roosevelt forced San Francisco schools to repeal its JapaneseAmerican school segregation order (165). Table 3 shows the differences in Japanese arrivingbefore and after the Gentlemen’s Agreement, where the percentage of relatives in America uponarrival, the percentage of those who intended upon arrival to stay in America permanently, andthe percentage of students, effectively doubled, post-agreement. One statistic which did notchange, was the three quarters of the migrant group whose fathers worked as either farmproprietors or laborers in Japan. Such a concentration likely influenced the Japanese entry intofarm labor and ownership, as 40% of all Japanese in California were working as farm laborers by1911, though the chronic labor shortages in the field likely played a role as well (Jiobu 1988,357). By 1910 the population of Japanese in Los Angeles began to expand rapidly. By 1920,65% of all Japanese in the United States resided in California, 28% of which resided in L.A. Just30ten years later, the rates jumped to 70% and 35%, respectively (Nishi 1958, 39). Japaneseimmigration was halted in 1924 by the Johnson-Reed Act due to rising anti-Japanese sentiment,going directly against the Gentleman’s Agreement which upset many Japanese.Figure 2: Immigration from Japan, 1860-2008Figure 2. Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2008. 2008. Washington D.C.: Department ofHomeland Security. https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook/2008.31Table 3: Characteristics of Japanese, by arrival before or after Gentlemen’s Agreement.Table 3. John Modell, Tradition and Opportunity: The Japanese Immigrant in America (PacificHistorical Review, 1971), 166, Table I.Visible in Table 2, many of the Japanese immigrants who originally came as a cheap formof agricultural labor, soon shifted from this wage labor to independent ownership and small-scalefarming. This reduced the supply of laborers and increased competition for domestic growers inthe fresh-produce market. As a result, more state legislature was passed closing other “legalloopholes” to Japanese farming, such as the “Alien Land Law” which restricted land ownershipby foreigners (Yagasaki 1987, 184). In turn, Japanese-operated farms decreased from 361,276acres in 1920, to 191,427 acres in 1930 (Nishi 1958, 39). Among all issei, self-employed farmersexperienced the most discrimination by the host society. Aside from these discriminatory landlaws, they also lost much of their farmland during the forced evacuation and internment during32World War II. Self-employed farming issei also reported the highest incidence of white hostility,likely because farming put them in direct competition with majority interest groups, a primetarget for white racism (Woodrum, Rhodes, and Feagin 1980, 1249).Table 2: Japanese household occupational distributions for first jobs (pre and post WWIIinternment eras).Table 2. Eric Woodrum, Colbert Rhodes, Joe R. Feagin, Japanese American Economic Behavior:Its Types, Determinants, and Consequences (Social Forces, 1980), 1238, Table I.As the Japanese population in America continued to grow in the early 20th century, therise of Japanese children (under 17) began to grow exponentially, from 33% to 86% by 1908(Modell 1971, 168). 84% of those arriving as minors after the Gentlemen’s Agreement werehelped by relatives. This presence of family contributed greatly to the growing ethnic economy,as new arrivals were immediately greeted by an ethnic community independent of thesurrounding society. Of the new arrivals who had either parents or siblings present, they usedhelp from family to find their first job 65% of the time (Modell 1971, 169). The social cohesionof the Japanese community very much so helped the first-generation escape the status of wage33labor in agriculture, as they looked to group and family resources to assist in economicdevelopment.It is interesting to note that immigrants who identified with traditional Japanese religionslike Buddhism and Shinto became self-employed farmers 37% of the time, compared to only19.3% of Christians (Woodrum, Rhodes, and Feagin 1980, 1240). There was also anoverrepresentation of issei Christians that became nonfarm proprietors or entered managerial andofficial occupations. This was likely the case because the traditional issei preferred to maintaintheir religious affiliations in the “relative isolation” allowed by agricultural professions, whilesome hypothesize that through Christianity, Christian issei had a preliminary introduction toAmerican culture which allowed for a more seamless entry into economic relations with thewhite community (Woodrum, Rhodes, and Feagin 1980, 1240).Following these land restrictions and other discriminatory practices, Japanese entry intourban enterprise accelerated. By 1909, Japanese entrepreneurs owned almost 3,000 small shopsin several Western cities. 40% of Japanese men in Los Angeles were self-employed and operatedbusinesses such as dry-cleaning, fisheries, and produce stands (selling Japanese farm production)(Portes and Manning 1986, 54). By 1920, 28% of all Japanese Americans resided in L.A. county,and by 1930, the number jumped again to 36%. 47% of hotels and 25% of grocery stores inSeattle were Japanese owned by 1919 (Light 1972, 10). In spite of this, the prominence ofJapanese in produce farming and wholesaling remained strong, and Japanese Americans came todominate intensive labor agriculture in California (Jiobu 1988, 357). For example, in theSacramento area, Japanese farmers grew 80% of tomatoes supplied to canneries, 78% of spinach,and 61% of asparagus. Prior to World War II, Japanese farmers were producing over 90% of snapbeans, strawberries, and celery, and 50% of artichokes, cauliflower, cucumbers, and tomatoes.34This accounted for 30% to 40% of all truck crops, within a Japanese population that nevertopped 2.1% through 1940. Japanese farm ownership could persist because the land laws did notapply to nisei, the American born second generation Japanese. Through loopholes, there wereinstances of nisei owning the farms of relatives and close friends who could not otherwise ownland. Japanese wholesalers purchased crops grown by Japanese farmers, to be sold by Japaneseretailers, which built a strong vertical integration among co-ethnics, and served to benefit bothparties. Farmers could trust that there would always be a wholesale outlet available for theirhighly perishable crops, and wholesalers could trust that the farmers would deliver qualityproduct on time and in full, in the absence of any binding legal contracts. Wholesalers andretailers often had to bargain with each other when certain crops were in oversupply, in shortage,or of bad quality. All parties benefited from the additional trust that came with ethnic ties, andthe common subculture of Japanese customs, traditions, and practices. On the flip side, thosewith reputations as an untrustworthy business partner could be quickly blacklisted and shamedby the community. Alongside the rise of farming, contract gardening became another largebusiness for Japanese Americans in rich white neighborhoods. These gardeners purchased fromJapanese greenhouse and supply stores, used Japanese trash haulers to collect garden trash, andparked at Japanese-owned gas stations in convenient locations where they all met up at the endof the day to socialize. The Japanese in non farming pursuits also benefited from their co-ethnic’sprominence in agriculture, as supply and equipment stores, feed stores, restaurants, hotels, andfinancial institutions owned by Japanese all relied on agriculture for part of their existence. It isinteresting to note that even while nisei (second generation) had levels of educational attainmentequal to that of whites, it did not help them at all in finding employment in the white economy.Likely a result of discrimination, Nisei were unlikely to be hired in many white collar35professions, and instead remained within Japanese American communities working blue collarjobs (Jiobu 1988, 363). Ultimately, the Japanese pursuit of self-employment in commerce wasnot solely a cultural inclination towards entrepreneurship but was also a practical response to adiscriminatory opportunity structure that provided limited options for non-menial wage or salarylabor.In the spring of 1942, emergency orders approved by the president called for the removalof all persons of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast. In the span of 4.5 months, the forcedresettlement was completed, as other minority groups herded to take over the vacant Japanesefarms, homes and businesses. Relocation centers were in undeveloped drylands and swamplandregions, without any economic or geographical significance (Nishi 1958, 41). There were zeroreported cases of anti-American acts by any Japanese person in any of the internment campsthroughout its entire existence. Evacuees were given the option of returning to the West Coast orresettling elsewhere, and through hard work and resilience, 90% of the displaced were able tosecure permanent housing within one year of release. Unfortunately, only 25% were able torepossess their own homes (Nishi 1958, 43).4.3 Korean Immigration (Post-1965)Prior to 1965, there was a relatively small amount of Korean migration to the UnitedStates. First during the turn of the 20th century, when the first treaty on immigration between theUnited States and Korea was signed in 1882, Korean laborers were brought to Hawaii to breakstrikes by Japanese plantation workers. In the following years more than 7,000 Koreans migratedto Hawaii, though many left plantation work shortly after their arrival (Noland 2003, 62). Thesecond wave of immigration took place in the years following the Korean War, where students36came to the United States for graduate education. Parallel to this movement was a period whereAmerican couples began adopting Korean babies. Roughly 100,000 adoptees became Americansbetween 1955 and 1998 (Noland 2003, 63).The third and most concentrated wave of Korean immigration was a result of the 1965Hart-Celler Act, which opened the door for immigration from non-European countries. Figure 3shows the numerical rise in Korean immigrants, as well as by percentage of the U.S. population.Figure 3: Korean immigrants living in the United States, 1960-2000Source: Marcus Noland, The Impact of Korean Immigration in the US Economy (The KoreanDiaspora in the World Economy, 2003) 65, Figure 4.1.Korean immigrants from this period make up most of the Korean American communitytoday. High unemployment rates, political insecurity, and military dictatorship were allcontributing factors to why so many Koreans immigrated to the United States during this period.37Unlike prior Korean migration to the United States, many were college-educated and broughttheir families with them (Noland 2003, 63). Some Koreans arrived as highly trainedprofessionals and went directly into fields such as the expanding US healthcare network.However, difficulties with the English language as well as restricted access to Americancorporate careers made it difficult for many qualified Koreans to find appropriate employment,so many shifted to small business ownership in large cities (Kim and Naughton 1993, 183).Some went into the import/export industry with Korean manufacturers, while others worked instorefront businesses such as local groceries, liquor stores, and dry cleaners. These businessesrequired limited interaction, and thus minimized the effects of language barriers. Ultimately,earnings from small business ownership far exceeded that of non-professional immigrants in thesecondary labor market. Koreans soon became one of the highest achieving immigrant groups interms of economic success, experiencing a jump from $5.5 million in gross receipts from Koreanowned businesses in 1977, to $2.6 billion in 1982, just five years later. By the end of the 1980’s,Korean Americans had achieved the highest business-ownership rate among all racial and ethnicgroups in the United States (Kim and Naughton 1993, 184). By 1990, Korean Americanself-employment reached 17%, compared to 9.7% of the general population (US Bureau of theCensus 1993).It is important to note, however, that part of the economic achievement experienced bypost-1965 Korean immigrants was a result of the economic opportunities in the United Statesduring the 1970s and 1980s, a time of general prosperity for the greater society. There wereevolving demographic and consumption patterns, which allowed opportunities for economicachievement. For example, Koreans were able to capitalize on the growing consumer demand forcosmetic and apparel items during the 1970s, which opened a range of commercial roles as38wholesale dealers importing goods from Korea, to the retailers and peddlers selling to Americanconsumers (Kim and Naughton 1993, 186). This interdependence between Korean producers,suppliers, and retailers made for a very strong vertical integration of Koreans in variousbusinesses. For example, in a survey conducted among Korean business owners in Chicago andLos Angeles, 63% of respondents in Chicago and 71% from L.A. had one or more Koreansuppliers (Yoon 1997, 147). This bond of ethnicity with Korean suppliers was helpful for thosewho felt uncomfortable working with American suppliers because of language and culturalbarriers. Oftentimes retailers received benefits from Korean suppliers such as extended creditterms, lower prices, and information about new arrivals of popular items. Another example ofopportune timing can be observed in the Korean entry into urban retail store businesses aroundthe same time, such as grocery stores and dry cleaners. Much of this success can be attributed tothe out-migration of white populations and the reluctance of white businesses to start businessesin areas of growing minority populations, which opened the space to Korean small-businessowners. Both instances represent the Korean American in middle minority business (Kim andNaughton 1993, 187).While Korean business owners achieved relatively high income levels at higher rates thanthe greater United States (43% at an annual income of over $50,000, versus only 16.8% of U.S.households), they also faced a number of drawbacks (Min 1990, 439). Concentration in theselabor intensive small businesses requires extremely long working hours, as surveys of LosAngeles Korean entrepreneurs revealed an average of 60 hour work week, with 72% working sixor seven days a week. This makes Korean business owners susceptible to chronic fatigue, anddepression. Among the four main Asian groups, Koreans consistently scored highest on thedepression scale. The prominence of Korean businesses in low-income, high-crime areas also39opens Korean entrepreneurs to risk of robberies, shoplifting and vandalism. Koreans in businessareas such as grocery, liquor, fish retail, and dry cleaning, all rely on white suppliers who havebeen observed to discriminate in terms of quality of merchandise, price, and speed of delivery(Min 1990, 443).As the community continued to grow, a support network of businesses began to emergeand cater to the population. Aside from the general commitment to education and professionaldevelopment which many first-generation Korean immigrants brought with them, equally asnecessary was the access to proper financing and training to open a business. Rotating creditassociations were a big part of the economic success experienced by the first generation ofKorean Americans who faced several structural constraints such as racial discrimination,prejudice, and exclusion in established American society. Language and cultural barriers, thelack of a collateral asset and credit history, as well as an unfamiliarity with financial institutions,also contributed to this problem.4.4 ConclusionChapter 4 took a historical approach in its investigation of the immigration trends,structural barriers, occupational tendencies, as well as educational and work histories of theJewish, Japanese, and Koreans, during their respective periods of immigration. It provides thenecessary context to better understand the background of each immigrant group, as well as theirsubsequent successes. To various degrees, all three of these groups faced political and economicinstability in their home countries, motivating them to move to the United States for betteropportunities. Jewish, Japanese, and Koreans were all concentrated in their own specific regionsof the United States, which shaped the conditions they encountered. Based on their time of40arrival, each group chose occupations based on limitations provided by the current economiclandscape, their previous work and educational experience, and the confines of the ethniccommunity. The approach taken explains the emergence of self-employment within each group,and paints the picture for Chapter 5 which will discuss the ethnic financing institutions whichallowed these immigrants access to start-up capital, which was crucial to opening andmaintaining a small-business.5. Ethnic Money-lending Institutions5.1 Disclaimer:The historical and social contexts in which various immigrant groups arrive to a foreignland, has a strong influence on their occupational choices and viability and chances for economicgrowth (Portes and Martinez 2019, 4). Therefore, while it is important to examine the successesof Japanese, Jewish, and Korean immigrants in achieving rapid economic advancement, it isequally important to acknowledge that this claim may not be generalizable to all immigrantgroups. For example, there are different types of ethnic firms, as well as different modes ofincorporation (see literature review) which immigrants find themselves in. This is why it isimportant to approach the analysis of ethnically unique behaviors with a cultural framework,which looks at the cultural traits brought from the country of origin, as well as a contextualframework, investigating immigrants’ responses to their new society (Tenenbaum 1989, 211).Approaching the analysis with an exclusively cultural interpretation has led to harmful beliefssuch as the “culture of poverty” trope, stating that certain ethnic groups achieve higher levels ofeconomic success than others, because of “superior group traits not possessed by the others”(Darity Jr. et al. 37). They view the persistent poverty of certain ethnic groups as an41intergenerational cycle of self-sabotage that is perpetuated by behaviors like an indifferencetoward educational attainment, saving, asset building, or keeping a job. On the other hand, anexclusively contextual interpretation ignores the deep cultural histories of immigrant groupswhich may provide valuable insights into the decisions made in Am
