Executive Summary  Introduction Coastal communities in San Diego County face ever-increasing risks from sea level rise, coastal storm events, flooding, and beach erosion. The potential hazards to this vital, vibrant 70-mile stretch of California coastline compel city planners and decision-makers to develop coastal resilience initiatives by conducting vulnerability assessments and considering potential adaptation strategies. Nexus Planning & Research was tasked with providing a comparative benefit-cost analysis of coastal resilience strategies for participating cities in San Diego County, following the framework outlined in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) funded study, What Will Adaptation Cost? An Economic Framework for Coastal Community Infrastructure (NOAA, 2013). Specifically, we were directed to comparatively assess the trade-offs (spending vs. benefits) of various coastal resilience strategies, as identified by participating jurisdictions. Ultimately, the City of Carlsbad and the City of Del Mar were the two jurisdictions that participated in this study. We evaluated the potential damage or loss to "at-risk" properties from sea level rise, and the cost of protecting, adapting, or abandoning those properties. The intent of this study is to compare the cost and benefits of sea level rise action scenarios, using benefit-cost ratios.  This report is part of a larger, multifaceted project led by the San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative, a partnership of local and regional agencies and groups. The project, "Connecting the Dots and Building Coastal Resilience in the San Diego Region," was funded through the NOAA Coastal Resilience Grants Program, a federally funded opportunity for coastal communities to prepare for changing sea levels and extreme storm events. Our study expressly followed the NOAA framework with the intent of: 1) Testing the methodology, 2) Utilizing the participating jurisdictions as case studies, and 3) Providing lessons learned. While the NOAA framework focuses on coastal flooding, we also evaluated bluff erosion and chronic inundation where applicable. (We did not evaluate river flooding.) In addition, the analysis incorporated a high-level overview of potential fiscal impacts to the participating cities.  The purpose of the NOAA framework is to provide benefit-cost ratios for comparing multiple sea level rise adaptation strategies or scenarios. Following that approach, the intent of this study was to compare action scenarios for a specified geographic area consisting of one or more sea level rise adaptation strategies. The strategies within the action scenarios fall into three categories: natural or engineered protection (beach nourishment or armoring with structures), accommodation (raising structures), and managed retreat (removing structures). We collected existing units and construction costs for selected adaptation strategies, developed cost estimates for the action scenarios, and applied them temporally as indicated by the respective jurisdictional schedules. The project life for the economic analysis depends on the adaptation strategy employed within the action scenario.  2  Results of the Cost-Benefit Study A primary output of this study is the comparative assessment of the trade-offs (spending vs. benefits) of the action scenarios as identified by participating jurisdictions. To evaluate the trade-offs, we first developed cost inputs to the model, including: 1. Monetized baseline risk primary and secondary impacts, which represent the maximum damages prevented, or the "no action" scenario 2. Monetized impacts resulting from action scenarios 3. Implementation costs of adaptation strategies  4. Benefits of each action scenario (damages prevented)  5. Capital and maintenance costs of action scenarios After inputting the costs into the model, we calculated the net benefits and benefit-cost ratios for the action scenarios. The benefit-cost ratio is the net present value (NPV) of total benefits divided by NPV of total costs. The benefit-cost ratio is used for comparing action scenarios and determining whether the benefits outweigh the cost. The following section details the outcome of the benefit-cost comparison. For more information about each action scenario, see the “Assess What You Can Do Differently: Adaptation Scenarios and Strategies” chapter in this report. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the net benefits are the NPV of total benefits, minus the NPV of total costs. For Carlsbad and Del Mar, all of the benefit-cost ratios are higher than 1, meaning the benefits are greater than the costs. Table 1: Net Benefits and Benefit-Cost Ratios Selected Study Area Planning Zone 1, Carlsbad, CA   NPV of Total Benefits ($million) NPV of Total Costs ($million) NPV Benefits ($million) Benefit-to-Cost Ratio Scenario 1 $817.7 $11.2 $806.5 72.88 Scenario 2 $722.6 $25.7 $696.9 28.12 Scenario 3 $817.7 $14.4 $803.3 56.97  Table 2: Net Benefits and Benefit-Cost Ratios North Beach Del Mar, CA   NPV of Total Benefits ($million) NPV of Total Costs ($million) NPV Benefits ($million) Benefit-to-Cost Ratio Scenario 1a $2,843.2 $335.4 $2,507.8 8.48 Scenario 1b $2,601.2 $363.0 $2,238.2 7.17 Scenario 2 $2,805.2 $567.3 $2,237.9 4.94 3  For Carlsbad, Scenario 1 has the greatest return on investment. For every $1.00 spent, there is a return of $72.88. Scenario 2 has a return of $28.12 for every dollar spent, and Scenario 3’s return in $56.97. These ratios assume that the three action scenarios are equally effective at preventing damages. This assumption is varied in the sensitivity analysis. For Del Mar, Scenario 1a has the greatest return on investment. For every $1.00 spent, there is a return of $8.48. Scenario 1b has a return of $7.17 for every dollar spent, and Scenario 2’s return in $4.94. Again, these ratios assume that the three action scenarios are equally effective at preventing damages. The robustness of these results is tested in the sensitivity analysis. While we did not incorporate qualitative considerations into our analyses, city planners and decision-makers would want to consider the implications of non-monetized benefits or costs. Additionally, per the NOAA framework, each city should consider funding feasibility when deciding among action scenarios. Sensitivity Analysis We conducted sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our results. That is, even if we modified some of our assumptions, would Scenario 1 and Scenario 1a still have the most return on the investment? We tested assumptions related to the following: equal effectiveness of action scenarios, discount rate, loss of property tax revenue in Del Mar Scenario 2, and loss of beach tourism and city tax revenue. We found that our results were robust to all of the assumptions, except those related to effectiveness and the discount rate. Effectiveness (Protection Factor) We found that for both cities, the initial results were not robust to assumptions about effectiveness.  The protection factor was varied using 25 percent, 50 percent, and 75 percent effectiveness levels and compared to the results at a 100 percent effectiveness level. We assumed that each action scenario prevented damages equally by setting a protection factor of 100 percent, i.e., it prevents against all baseline risk damages. However, as Figure 1 and Figure 2 show, if Carlsbad Scenario 1 and Del Mar Scenario 1a are not as effective as the other action scenarios, then they might not be the most cost-effective choice. Figure 1 shows that while Carlsbad Scenario 1 (beach nourishment and groins) initially appears to be the best choice, that ranking depends upon its effectiveness. For example, if Scenario 1 is less effective, e.g. 75 percent effective at preventing baseline damages, and Scenario 3 (beach nourishment, raise/improve seawalls and revetments) is 100 percent effective, then Scenario 3 has the higher benefit-cost ratio (56.97 versus 54.66). In Del Mar, we find a similar circumstance (Figure 2). Scenario 1a (beach nourishment and groins) has the highest benefit-cost ratio when all scenarios are assumed to have the same effectiveness. However, if Scenario 1a is less effective, e.g. 75 percent effective at preventing damages and Scenario 1b is 100 percent effective, then Scenario 1b is more cost-effective (7.17 versus 6.36).    4  Figure 1: Varied Effectiveness Assumption Selected Study Area Planning Zone 1, Carlsbad, CA   Figure 2: Varied Effectiveness Assumption North Beach Del Mar, CA  Discount Rate Because action scenarios could incur costs on different timeframes, various discount rates could also alter study results. When cities undertake similar analyses with adaption strategy implementation of distinct timelines that extend in the far future, they should carefully consider which discount rate to apply, or conduct similar sensitivity analysis before making a decision.  We assumed a one percent discount rate, (as found in other similar studies,) however, because the timeline of the adaptation strategies and negative benefits differed by action scenarios, it was pertinent 18.2236.4454.6672.884.2612.2120.1728.1214.2428.4942.7356.970.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.0025% 50% 75% 100%Benefit-Cost RatioProtection Factor (Effectiveness)Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 32.124.246.368.481.293.255.217.171.192.443.694.940.001.002.003.004.005.006.007.008.009.0025% 50% 75% 100%Benefit-Cost RatioProtection Factor (Effectiveness)Scenario 1a Scenario 1b Scenario 25  to test our discount rate assumption. Discount rates of two percent and three percent were compared to the results at a one percent discount rate. In Carlsbad, we found that our initial results were not robust to the discount rate assumption (Figure 3). While the Scenario 1 benefit-cost ratio (72.88) is the highest when assuming a one percent discount rate, Scenario 3’s ratio (45.87) is higher than Scenario 1’s ratio (44.28) when the discount rate is three percent. This ranking change is due to Scenario 1 having the higher implementation costs early on, while Scenario 3’s costs are spread out across decades.  Figure 3: Varied Discount Rates Selected Study Area Planning Zone 1, Carlsbad, CA   Del Mar’s initial results, on the other hand, are robust. As shown in Figure 4, the sensitivity analysis of the discount rate does not change the ratio rankings. Scenario 1a has the highest benefit-cost ratio across all three discount rates.      72.8856.5444.2828.1223.3419.4356.9751.3245.870.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.0060.0070.0080.001.0% 2.0% 3.0%Benefit-Cost RatioDiscount RateScenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 36  Figure 4: Varied Discount Rates North Beach Del Mar, CA   Ultimately, cities will need to consider benefit-cost ratios for each of their action scenarios, as well as their own city’s culture and character. In Carlsbad, Scenario 1 and Scenario 3 both show strong returns on investment, but planners might be inclined to choose Scenario 3 if they are concerned that the groin construction in Scenario 1 could negatively impact local surfing. Del Mar could select to engineer groins, as in their Scenario 1a, over Scenario 1b's raising or improving their seawalls, even though the results were not robust to effectiveness assumptions. For both cities, coastal resiliency choices should not only weigh short-term and long-term cost, but also reflect the communities’ values and identity.  Lessons Learned The intent of these “Lessons Learned” is to provide future practitioners with additional information and guidance that may help focus and refine their implementation of NOAA’s framework for greater efficiency and effectiveness.  NOAA’s framework offers different approaches to the benefit-cost analyses based on factors such as the goals of a study, technical knowledge and expertise, and data availability. While this study followed one general approach provided in NOAA’s framework, we did take additional steps to modify the methodology or verify data accuracy when specific information was not available or directly applicable. The “Lessons Learned” attempts to capture our professional experience with implementation of NOAA’s framework, and the information revealed during application of the additional steps.   1. The NOAA Framework. We found the broad, flexible approach of the NOAA Framework adaptable to meet each of our city’s needs, however, the trade-off was a lack of specificity. As such, it provides little direction regarding assumptions that are specific to a city’s unique characteristics or needs. For example, post-flood clean-up costs may be additional costs to the city or incorporated into the existing budget. 8.4810.9513.927.179.1811.464.94 3.803.040.002.004.006.008.0010.0012.0014.0016.001.0% 2.0% 3.0%Benefit-Cost RatioDiscount RateScenario 1a Scenario 1b Scenario 27  Practitioners attempting to apply the NOAA framework will need to make decisions about the most appropriate dollar values to apply, or the size and location of specific adaptation strategies (see #2 below).  Additionally, the NOAA framework is presented as a linear process, but in practice, performing the tasks is a nonlinear endeavor. Utilizing multiple team members, different tasks can be performed simultaneously as some tasks do not need to occur in the same order as presented in the framework. However, we recommend practitioners have the technical knowledge and expertise to adjust and revise the approach. 2. Project and site-specific information is necessary to provide more detailed cost estimates.  Adaptation strategies are dependent on geographic and oceanic conditions specific to an area. As a result, options for adaptation strategies can vary widely depending on existing conditions and the goals of the adaptation strategy. Additionally, labor, materials and seasonal considerations will inevitably vary, nationally. We found historic city expenditures and quoted estimates from local resources and vendors to be better cost indicators than those obtained via out-of-region projects, other studies or generic software packages. 3. The value of GIS and parcel level information versus geographically aggregated approach. The NOAA framework provides different methods for evaluating impacts, ranging from broad, geographically aggregated approaches such as FEMA’s Hazus MH Flooding or the COAST (Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level rise Tool) model. However, we found the use of more site-specific information obtained via parcel level information (obtained using GIS or through primary data collection) provided more precise information regarding costs and potential impacts. We believe the additional time and cost to use this approach is worthwhile.  4. The value of “ground-truthing” and on-the-ground site inspection. The vulnerability assessments rely upon CoSMoS flooding and inundation GIS layers overlain on city parcel maps and satellite imagery. Ground-truthing, the process whereby GIS layers and images are compared to what is on the ground in reality, is necessary to verify the contents of the image and, in this case, the output of the vulnerability assessments.  On-the-ground inspections resolved real and perceived conflicts in the data. In addition, site inspections revealed differences not captured by the GIS analyses alone. While the NOAA Framework can be performed as a desktop effort, we recommend practitioners be, or become, familiar with actual conditions on the ground.     5. The value of collaboration with appropriate agencies. Adaptation planning and analyses, including benefit-cost analysis, is best performed as a collaborative, iterative process. Through open dialogue with local, state, and federal agencies, practitioners can collect and analyze the most relevant information. Periodic feedback from participating agencies contributes to an output with better defined parameters. We also found the 8  collaboration necessary and vital to the project schedule, and setting (or resetting) project expectations.  Study Limitations City planners and decision-makers should only use the benefit-cost ratios in this study to comparatively rank which scenario has the greatest return on investment. Total net benefits, which can be used comparatively as well, should not be used as individual estimates of return on investment. Our analysis represents a high-level approximation for the study areas, with generic structure and infrastructure replacement or repair costs that may not reflect actual costs and specifications in the event of a real loss.  The action scenario cost estimates are intended to provide an approximation of total project costs and do not represent conceptual level of design costs or preliminary design costs. The actual project descriptions for adaptation strategies (and construction costs) may differ substantially from what is provided herein. It is recommended that financial feasibility not be assessed until any preliminary design is accomplished, based on a more thorough consideration of coastal processes, regulatory and environmental opportunities and constraints, and engineering. The fiscal impact analysis (FIA) contains an analysis of recurring revenues and costs to the jurisdiction from potential loss of property and services. The FIA is based on estimates, assumptions, and other information developed from our research, interviews, telephone discussions with the jurisdictions and County of San Diego staff, and information from our database collected through fiscal impact analyses previously prepared by us and others. It is not considered to be a “financial forecast” nor a “financial projection” as technically defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The word “projection” used within this report relates to broad expectations of future events or market conditions. The analysis also does not consider sea level rise impacts on public health, socio-economic issues, ecosystems and nature habitats, threatened or endangered species, or environmental damage, e.g., oils spills and discharge of pollution. The sources of information and basis of the estimates are stated herein. While we believe the sources of information are reliable, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the accuracy of such information. The analyses are based on estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to uncertainty and variation depending on evolving events. Some assumptions inevitably will not materialize, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, and actual results may vary from the projections. Therefore, we cannot represent that the results presented here will definitely be achieved.      9  Introduction  Coastal communities in San Diego County face ever-increasing risks from sea level rise, coastal storm events, flooding, and beach erosion. The potential hazards to this vital, vibrant 70-mile stretch of California coastline compel city planners and decision-makers to develop coastal resilience initiatives by conducting vulnerability assessments and considering potential adaptation strategies. This report examines the benefit-cost of various coastal resilience strategies as part of a larger, multifaceted project led by the San Diego Regional Climate Collaborative, a partnership of local and regional agencies and groups. The project, "Connecting the Dots and Building Coastal Resilience in the San Diego Region," was funded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Coastal Resilience Grants Program, a federally funded opportunity for coastal communities to prepare for changing sea levels and extreme storm events. Nexus Planning & Research was tasked with providing a comparative cost-benefit analysis of coastal resilience strategies for participating cities in San Diego County, following the framework outlined in the NOAA-funded study, What Will Adaptation Cost? An Economic Framework for Coastal Community Infrastructure (NOAA, 2013). Specifically, we were directed to comparatively assess the trade-offs (spending vs. benefits) of various coastal resilience strategies as identified by participating jurisdictions. We evaluated the potential damage or loss to "at-risk" properties from sea level rise, and the cost of protecting, adapting, or abandoning those properties. The intent of this study is to compare the cost and benefits of sea level rise action scenarios, using benefit-cost ratios.  In addition, the analysis incorporates a high-level overview of potential fiscal impacts to the participating cities. Ultimately, the City of Carlsbad and the City of Del Mar were the two jurisdictions that participated in this study. Our study expressly follows the NOAA framework with the intent of: 1) Testing the methodology, 2) Utilizing the participating jurisdictions as case studies, and 3) Providing lessons learned. While the NOAA framework focuses on coastal flooding, we also evaluated bluff erosion and chronic inundation, where applicable. We did not evaluate river flooding.  Vulnerability Assessments The City of Carlsbad and the City of Del Mar both provided sea level rise and coastal flooding vulnerability assessments. However, each city applied different methodological approaches. Del Mar evaluated impacts based on a projection of more frequent coastal flooding events in the future, applying damages from historical storms. Carlsbad focused on increased water depths and expected damages due to those increases. This study describes our process for incorporating both types of vulnerability assessments into the NOAA framework.  Action Scenarios Del Mar provided a plan outlining action scenarios to prevent future sea level rise damages. Each action scenario identified one or more combined sea level adaptation strategies. The purpose of the NOAA 10  framework is to provide benefit-cost ratios for comparing multiple sea level rise adaptation strategies or scenarios. Del Mar provided multiple action scenarios for only one area located between the Solana Beach border to the north and 29th Street to the south, known as North Beach. Therefore, we were only able to assess the North Beach area. As only a single bluff erosion action scenario was provided in the Del Mar Adaptation Plan, it was not included in our analysis. As previously mentioned, we were not tasked with evaluating the river flooding action scenarios. At the time of this study, Carlsbad had not completed an adaptation plan, and therefore was unable to provide action scenarios or adaptation strategies unique to its jurisdiction. Through discussion with Carlsbad city planners, we were directed to adapt and apply Del Mar’s North Beach action scenarios to the northern portion of Carlsbad’s beach area: Planning Zone 1. While Buena Vista Lagoon is within Planning Zone 1, the city asked us to exclude the lagoon from our analyses. Therefore, the Carlsbad analysis focuses on only the coastal area of Planning Zone 1, referred to as the “Selected Study Area, Planning Zone 1.” The Del Mar and Carlsbad action scenarios contain different variations of the following adaptation strategies: 1. Beach Sand Nourishment 2. Groins 3. Seawalls  4. Revetments  5. Elevate Structures (Del Mar only) 6. Remove Structures – Acquisition/Demolition (Del Mar only)   11  Background  Participating Jurisdictions Carlsbad Carlsbad, California is an incorporated coastal city in northern San Diego County located approximately 87 miles south of Los Angeles, and 35 miles north of downtown San Diego. It is bordered on the north by the City of Oceanside, to the east by the cities of Vista and San Marcos and unincorporated areas of San Diego County, to the south by the City of Encinitas, and to the west by the Pacific Ocean. Nicknamed, "The Village by the Sea," Carlsbad is a resort community that features seven miles of beach and coastal bluffs, inland hills, and a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. Carlsbad's total area of 39.1 square miles is comprised of 37.7 square miles of land, and 1.4 square miles of water due to its three lagoons and one lake, and has an elevation of 52 feet above sea level. The majority of residences in Carlsbad consist of single-family homes and newer, high-end planned communities. According to realtor.com, the median closing price for all home types in Carlsbad, as of March 2017, was $745,000. According to the California State Department of Finance (DOF), Carlsbad's population is estimated to be 112,930 as of January 1, 2016, with a density of 2,995 people per square mile. According to the 2015 1-year American Community Survey, 73.1 percent of Carlsbad households are families, 46.4 percent of which have children under 18. The racial composition is mostly non-Hispanic White (76 percent), followed by 11 percent Hispanic or Latino, 9 percent Asian, approximately 3 percent Pacific Islander or other races, respectively, and less than 1 percent African American. More than half of Carlsbad residents are young Baby Boomers and Generation X: Almost 53 percent are 25 to 64 years old. Forty percent of all residents have a bachelor's degree or higher and the median household income is $96,300, with almost 30 percent of households earning $150,000 or more. In addition to its coastline, Carlsbad has an abundance of natural recreation resources include the southern shore of Buena Vista Lagoon, the Agua Hedionda lagoon, Batiquitos Lagoon, 13 community parks, and over 50 miles of hiking trails across more than 6,000 acres of permanent nature preserves and areas. Other leisure attractions include LEGOLAND California theme and water parks, three golf courses, and the downtown "Village" district of shops and restaurants, making tourism a major contributor to Carlsbad's economy. City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment Understanding Carlsbad's vulnerability to sea level rise provides city planners and decision-makers with the knowledge needed to lessen the city's exposure to coastal hazards. Planning for future coastal events is complex and highly predictive; therefore, the City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment draft (City of Carlsbad, 2016) (Carlsbad Assessment) uses high and low sea level rise estimates to account for a range of scenarios.  The United States Geologic Survey’s (USGS) Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) was used to define and visualize three types of hazard zones for 2050 and 2100 planning horizons. According to the 12  Carlsbad Assessment, “The CoSMoS 0.5m and 2.0m sea level rise scenarios roughly align with the projected high sea level rise from the 2012 National Research Council’s report for the same planning horizons.” Therefore, the 2050 and 2100 sea level rise scenario results were used as the basis for the Carlsbad Assessment. We considered three types of hazard zones: 1. Inundation: An area that will be subject to recurrent "wetting and drying" as higher daily tides advance inland. 2. Coastal Flood: In addition to rising tidal hazards, some areas will experience event flooding due to extreme wave action caused by coastal storms. A 100-year storm event (a storm with a statistical 1% chance of occurring in any given year) was used to define this zone. The use of 100-year storm events has historical precedence in sea level rise literature when considering physical impacts from sea level rise from extreme events and storms (California Coastal Commission, 2015; NOAA, 2010). 3. Bluff: Carlsbad's shoreline includes coastal bluffs where rising sea levels will cause contact with daily tides or exposure to increased wave action, resulting in erosion. The Carlsbad Assessment divided the Carlsbad shoreline into three Planning Zones (Zones) to create manageable areas of examination. The length of shoreline within the Zones ranged from 1.4 to 2.4 miles, with each zone containing one of the three lagoons within Carlsbad city limits: the southern portion of Buena Vista Lagoon, Agua Hedionda Lagoon, or Batiquitos Lagoon. The Carlsbad Assessment provides an inventory of potentially affected assets including beaches, public works infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, state parks, environmentally sensitive lands, public access ways, and residential parcels. These assets were rated low, moderate, or high for their hazard exposure, impact sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.  City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Adaptation Strategies and Study Area At the time of this study, Carlsbad had not selected action scenarios or adaptation strategies. Through discussion with Carlsbad planners, we were directed to adapt and apply Del Mar’s North Beach action scenarios. Our study includes the following adaptation strategies, which fall within one or more action scenarios. More information about the specifics of each strategy can be found in the "Assessing What You Can Do Differently" chapter. • Beach nourishment for near-term protection  • Sand retention measures such as groins • Raising/improving the existing sea wall and revetments  Our analysis includes the coastal portion of Carlsbad’s beach area: Planning Zone 1. While Buena Vista Lagoon is within Planning Zone 1, it was not included per the city’s direction. Therefore, the Carlsbad analysis focuses on only the coastal area of Planning Zone 1, referred to as the “Selected Study Area, Planning Zone 1.” The study area is shown in Figure 5.  13  Figure 5: City of Carlsbad Planning Zones and Selected Study Area  Adapted from City of Carlsbad Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment draft, by City of Carlsbad, June 2016.   14  Del Mar  The City of Del Mar is a small beach city located on the Pacific coast in northern San Diego County. Long and narrow with an elevation of 112 feet above sea level, Del Mar's 18.1 square miles include approximately 2.5 miles of coast and an inland width of less than one mile at its widest point.  Del Mar has a small downtown village and three beaches. North Beach (commonly known as Dog Beach) is adjacent to the Scripps Bluff Preserve at the San Dieguito River outlet. North Del Mar Beach features two oceanfront public parks, whereas south Del Mar Beach is characterized by steep, high coastal bluffs and undeveloped stretches. Del Mar has a Mediterranean-subtropical climate with warm, dry summers and mild winters. Del Mar is also the home of the Del Mar Fairgrounds, host of the Del Mar Races, the San Diego County Fair, and other large regional events.   According to California DOF, Del Mar’s population is estimated to be 4,274 (236 people/square mile) as of January 1, 2016. According to the 2011-2015 American Community Survey its population is 84 percent non-Hispanic white, 13 percent Hispanic or Latino, 2 percent Asian, and less than 1 percent of all other surveyed races, each. Of Del Mar's 2,125 households, 15 percent have children under 18-years-old living in them. Over 60 percent of Del Mar residents are 25 to 64 years old, making late Baby Boomers and Generation X the two largest demographic groups. Sixty-four percent of all residents have a bachelor’s degree of higher and the median household income in Del Mar is $107,000, more than double the national median income for the same year. The majority of Del Mar residences are single-family homes, many of which are beachfront properties. Due to its small size, Del Mar is essentially "built-out" with little room for further development. According to realtor.com, the median closing price for a home in Del Mar was over $1.6 million, as of March 2017. Because of its shape, location and size, the City of Del Mar is especially impacted by coastal and river flooding, and beach and bluff erosion. The northern portion of the city, which includes the Del Mar Fairgrounds, lies within the San Dieguito River floodplain. Sea level rise will likely increase the severity and frequency of such risks.  City of Del Mar Coastal Hazards, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment Del Mar's Coastal Hazards, Vulnerability, and Risk Assessment draft (City of Del Mar, 2016a) (Del Mar Assessment) provides a detailed analysis of the city's vulnerabilities and risk from three coastal hazards: coastal flooding, coastal erosion (referred to as chronic inundation in our study), bluff erosion, and river flooding. The Del Mar Assessment examined various asset categories, such as parcels, city structures, and roads.  Coastal flooding and erosion vulnerabilities were examined using historical storm event and damage data, and estimated the increased likelihood of greater and more frequent damage, in accordance with upper-end sea level rise scenarios for 2030, 2050, 2070, and 2100, and preliminary data from the US Geological Survey's Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) v3.0 predictions for a 100-year (1% chance of occurring) extreme coastal flood. Beach elevations and widths, and still water levels were also examined. To forecast future erosion to Del Mar's coastal bluffs, historic bluff retreat measurements 15  were examined, and CoSMoS v3.0 was used to project cliff top retreat rates in 2100, for mid and high sea level rise scenarios.  Coastal hazards were mapped and classified: • Significant Coastal Flooding: Considered a current 10-year storm event, extent and vulnerabilities are based on the historical 2016 storm. • Extreme Coastal Flooding: Considered a current 100-year storm event, extend and vulnerabilities are based on the historical 1983 storm.  City of Del Mar Sea-Level Rise Adaptation Plan and Study Area The City of Del Mar Sea-Level Rise Adaptation Plan draft (City of Del Mar, 2016b) (Del Mar Adaptation Plan) serves as the city's long-range planning guide to address future sea level rise and its effects on storm surge and coastal flooding and erosion. The Del Mar Adaptation Plan draws on the Del Mar Assessment guidance provided by the City’s Sea-Level Rise Stakeholder Technical Advisory Committee (STAC), and the California Coastal Commission’s Sea Level Rise Policy Guidance (California Coastal Commission 2015) for addressing sea level rise in cities' Local Coastal Plan. The Del Mar Adaptation Plan provides a framework for Del Mar to manage risks and take actions based on specific triggers and monitoring of sea level rise and its effects.1 It provides action scenarios intended to manage risks, rather than proscribing a specific plan of action. The Del Mar Adaptation Plan assumes project-level planning and approvals will be required to further develop and implement the adaptation measures.  Our study includes the following adaptation strategies, which fall within one or more action scenarios. More information about the specifics of each strategy can be found in the "Assessing What You Can Do Differently" chapter. • Beach nourishment for near-term protection  • Sand retention measures such as groins • Raising/improving the existing sea wall and revetments • Raising infrastructure and structures • Removing structures  As previously stated, the intent of our study is to compare cost-benefit ratios for multiple action scenarios. Del Mar provided multiple action scenarios for only one area: North Beach. Therefore, this study only assesses the North Beach action scenarios. We were not tasked with evaluating river flooding action scenarios. The study area is shown in Figure 6.                                                                 1 At the time this study was initiated, the STAC had not yet given their formal recommendations on the above North Beach flooding and erosion adaptation measures and scenarios. This study does not attempt to account for future revisions to measures and scenarios. 16  Figure 6: City of Del Mar Community Planning Districts, North Beach Study Area  Adapted from City of Del Mar Sea-Level Rise Adaptation Plan draft, by ESA, September 2016. 17  NOAA Framework  This study’s primary purpose is to apply the NOAA methodology described in their report, What Will Adaptation Cost? An Economic Framework for Coastal Community Infrastructure (NOAA, 2013). The report, included in the appendix, provides a framework for comparing the cost and benefits of adaptation strategies that would lessen the coastal flooding impacts of current and future seal level rise. In applying their framework, our objective is to present and demonstrate a methodology that other cities can follow when doing similar studies. This chapter describes the broad components of the NOAA framework. Figure 7 shows the framework’s components and tasks. We found this broad approach flexible and adaptable enough to apply to various cities; however, the trade-off was a lack of specificity. As such, they provide little direction regarding assumptions specific to our cities’ needs. Anyone attempting to apply the NOAA framework will need to make decisions about the most appropriate dollar values to apply, or the size and location of particular adaptation strategies, because these assumptions will be unique to each city. Our report provides the assumptions we made for Carlsbad and Del Mar, and consequently, attempts to provide paradigm guidance for other cities. These details are found in the ensuing chapters.  Key Framework Components The NOAA framework has four key components, shown in Figure 7. Each section is broken down into tasks and more detailed steps. By following NOAA’s process, city planners and decision-makers can compare the costs and benefits of various adaptation scenarios to reduce the effects of sea level rise. In this chapter, we broadly describe each component of the framework, along with a brief description of our approach. We provide more detailed account of the tasks and our application in the following chapters. Definitions of Terms Sea Level Rise Scenarios: Projected increases of sea level rise, typically compared to mean sea level in 1992. Usually defined as low, intermediate, or high scenarios for analysis. Coastal Flooding: Flooding caused by increase in ocean’s sea level rise and storm events. Chronic Inundation1: Shoreline change resulting from an increase in ocean’s sea level rise. Bluff Erosion1: Wearing away of sediment at the bluff’s edge Primary Impacts: Includes directly impacted property or infrastructure, such as homes or roads. Secondary Impacts: Includes indirect impacts, such as business interruption or cleanup costs. Adaptation Strategy: An individual measure that reduces the impacts of flooding or storm events. Action Scenarios: A compilation of one or more adaptation strategies. Baseline Risks: The damages that would result if no adaptation strategies were in place. Benefits: Monetary benefits gained by implementing action scenarios. Also known as damages prevented. Costs: Monetary cost of implementing action scenarios. 1 Not discussed in the NOAA framework. 18  Figure 7: NOAA Framework  Adapted from What Will Adaptation Cost? An Economic Framework for Coastal Community Infrastructure, by NOAA, 2013.  According to NOAA, their framework can be used for assessing impacts on a city’s infrastructure in two ways. It can be used for assessing infrastructure broadly throughout the city, or a portion thereof, which is known as the holistic approach. Or, it can be used on one specific piece of infrastructure, such as a power plant. This is known as the priority infrastructure approach. We follow the holistic infrastructure approach because we are evaluating impacts to multiple infrastructures within specific geographic areas of the city.  The NOAA framework also has an impact assessment and risk assessment option. Each city should choose which option to pursue before beginning their analysis. Per the framework, the impact assessment estimates coastal flooding damages only using water depth, while the risk assessment uses water depth plus the probability of flooding events occurring, i.e., 10-year storm event. We follow the risk assessment approach because we wanted to incorporate the probability of events occurring. Also, it was our only option in Del Mar because we did not receive water depth data. Understanding Your Baseline Risk The first component of the NOAA framework is understanding the baseline risk. This includes selecting a sea level rise scenario(s), i.e., low, medium, or high, projecting high-water-level increases for future years, and assessing potentially exposed land, property, and infrastructure under these future sea level rise scenarios. This initial geographic extent assessment, along with the more detailed primary and secondary impacts developed in the "Costs and Benefits" chapter answers the question, "What would 1.

This is the “no action” scenario when evaluating costs and benefits.  To be consistent with each city’s documents, we selected the sea level rise scenario and hazard impacts identified in their vulnerability assessments.2 We did not conduct any separate hazard modeling. We also incorporated the modeled damages due to chronic inundation (Carlsbad and Del Mar) and bluff erosion (Carlsbad). Our analysis of Del Mar only included coastal flooding and beach loss due to chronic inundation for the North Beach area because it was the only area with multiple action scenarios that fell within the scope of this project.3 Assessing What You Can Do Differently Once a city identifies its baseline risk, it can establish adaptation strategies and action scenarios. Adaptation strategies are those tactics that a city can employ to lessen or protect against sea level rise damages. An action scenario is a combination of one or more adaptation strategies. For example, in one of its action scenarios, Del Mar chose to raise or improve their seawall, replenish the beach’s sand, and eventually, remove the impacted residential and commercial structures. These three strategies combine to create one action scenario. We opted to be consistent with each city’s plans and not release a study that could be misconstrued as an alternative plan. As Carlsbad did not have an adaptation study or plan from which to draw, we coordinated with Carlsbad planners and followed their direction for the selection of adaptation scenarios and geographic application. As already stated, we only analyzed the cost and benefits for those geographic areas with more than one action scenario, in adherence with the NOAA’s framework to compare two or more scenarios, rather than establish the net benefits of one.  The next step in NOAA’s process is to reevaluate the city’s impact from sea level rise with each action scenario in place. Since environmental modeling of coastal sea level rise impacts fell outside of the scope of this project and our expertise, we were unable to reassess impacts. Rather, the final cost-benefit model incorporates a protection or effectiveness factor, ranging from 0 - 100 percent, that can be altered using information provided by experts. For example, this factor could be set to 100 percent if the action scenario is expected to prevent all sea level rise impacts, or it could be set to 75 percent if it is expected to prevent most, but not all, impacts. This protection factor allows analysts to compare action scenarios based on their assumed effectiveness. For our analyses, we set that factor to 100 percent for all action scenarios because we did not have the expertise to make a judgment about each action scenario’s effectiveness. However, we tested the robustness of the effectiveness assumption in our sensitivity analysis (described later in the "Sensitivity Analysis" chapter).                                                              2 The NOAA framework focused on coastal flooding hazards. We also incorporated chronic inundation and bluff erosion hazards from each city’s vulnerability assessment. 3 Bluff erosion only included one action scenario, and thus could not be compared to another one. River flooding fell outside the scope of this project.  20  Calculating Costs and Benefits The purpose of this component is to monetize (assign a dollar value) the baseline (no action scenario), then re-assess impacts for each action scenario and estimate the costs of implementing each adaptation strategy within the action scenarios. These data will be used in the "Making a Decision: Results" chapter to compute benefit-cost ratios that compare relative return on investment for each action scenario, including the baseline scenario with no action.  Identifying impacts was the first task in this process. Using each city’s vulnerability assessment, we created a list of primary and secondary impacts within the predetermined asset categories that fell in the hazard zones. After the city identified their action scenarios, we also considered any additional positive or negative impacts associated with one action scenario over another. For example, Del Mar selected an action scenario that protected the beach across all years, and another where the beach was lost in later years. We accounted for these different impacts in the benefits side of the ratio.  Next, we assigned monetary values to the primary and secondary impacts. While we primarily quantified the costs to the city, we also estimated costs to residential and commercial property owners. See the "Costs and Benefits" chapter for a detailed description of the resources used for each primary and secondary impact. While we followed NOAA’s risk assessment methodology (versus their impact assessment method), the process was different for each city because each had different challenges associated with estimating future damages by storm type. Our adaptations are described in more detail in the "Costs and Benefits" chapter.  Lastly, we estimated the costs for implementing each adaptation strategy within the action scenarios. Data were gathered from a variety of sources, such as construction companies and the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). See the "Costs and Benefits" chapter for more detail. Making a Decision After all data are compiled, we aggregated to calculate the benefit-cost ratios. The chosen discount rate should also be incorporated into the analysis to calculate net present value (NPV) of benefits and costs. Because a dollar is worth more today than it will be in the future, future net benefits and costs are calculated in today’s dollars. This conversion is called "discounting," and NPV is the net value in today’s dollars. As Carlsbad action scenarios did not start until 2050, we evaluated the planning horizon years 2050 to 2100. In Del Mar, the action scenarios began in 2030 and we evaluated the years 2030 to 2100. City planners and decision-makers can compare these ratios to determine the best option for their community.  The first task was to assemble the total benefits of each action scenario. This step began with compiling the benefits, or potential damages prevented, from the baseline risk (no action scenario.) For both Carlsbad and Del Mar, we followed the process for the risk assessment option as it incorporated the probability of flooding occurrences into the calculations. From the baseline, annual expected damages were calculated for each action scenario by incorporating the annual probability of storm events, e.g., a 21  10-year storm. The NOAA framework provides the equations and step-by-step process for calculating and discounting expected annual losses. After determining the total benefits of each action scenario, the next step required compiling the adaptation strategy costs within each action scenario, and then discounting the cost to present value. For this step, the implementation timeline for each strategy must be determined, with the capital and maintenance costs specified by year (2030, 2040, etc.). Because the costs are incurred in different years, they must all be discounted back to present value to get the NPV. We followed the specified timelines given by each city.  Finally, the last task was to assess each action scenario by calculating net benefits and benefit-cost ratios. City planners and decision-makers can use these measures to determine which action scenario has the highest return on investment. They should also consider other relevant information that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, such as whether the loss of their beaches would change the culture or identity of their community. We developed benefit-cost ratios for each city and conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of our results. These are described in the "Sensitivity Analysis" chapter.   22        THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK   23  Baseline Risks   In this chapter, we focus on the NOAA Framework's "Understanding Your Baseline Risk" component. This chapter describes our specific baseline risk methodology and adjustments we made to fit each city’s approach. To make our process easier to replicate, we situated our methodology within the NOAA framework. The Carlsbad Assessment projected future flooding impacts by modeling the water level increases over time. The Del Mar Assessment, on the other hand, projected the increase in flooding occurrences over time by referencing past flooding events and flooding return probabilities. Both approaches provided the opportunity to apply NOAA’s baseline risk component in these two distinct circumstances. Carlsbad’s approach was more aligned with the NOAA’s high water level event scenarios (NOAA Chapter 1, Task 2). Del Mar’s approach did not necessitate incorporating high water level event scenarios. These differences and adaptations are described in this chapter.  We also expand upon the NOAA framework by including chronic inundation and bluff erosion hazards in our analyses. The specific hazards determine which, and how, baseline risks are identified. The Carlsbad study area in Planning Zone 1 assessed impacts causes by coastal flooding, chronic inundation, and bluff erosion. The Del Mar study area in North Beach, on the other hand, only included coastal flooding and chronic inundation. Thus, each baseline risk scenario incorporates different sources of the impacts, with Del Mar excluding bluff erosion. NOAA Methodology Adjustments Table 3, on the next page, shows the modifications by task and city. Most of these tasks were conducted as part of each city’s vulnerability assessment. We acquired those assessments and relevant GIS layers to incorporate into this study. The Carlsbad Assessment identified two sea level rise scenarios using CoSMoS v3.0. Per their report, they selected 0.5 meters (1.64 ft.) and 2.0 meters (6.56 ft.), which roughly parallels the forecasted high sea level rise from the 2012 National Research Council’s report for the 2050 and 2100 planning horizons (City of Carlsbad, 2016). To be consistent with the Carlsbad Assessment hazard modeling, we chose the high sea level rise scenario with the 2050 and 2100 planning horizons. Task 1: Select Appropriate Local Sea Level Rise Scenarios  Task 2: Develop High Water Level Event Scenarios Task 3: Assess Exposed Infrastructure for Your No Action Scenario Understanding Your Baseline Risk 24  The Del Mar Assessment differed in its approach by projecting the increase in flooding occurrences over time, instead of the water level increases like those used by Carlsbad. The Del Mar Assessment used flooding return probabilities and damages from past storm events to predict future impacts of coastal flooding. This required us to adapt NOAA’s methodology, and as a result, there was no need to conduct Task 2 (Develop High-level Water Event Scenarios) in this section because future damages were not based on water depths.  Table 3: Understanding Your Baseline Risk: Adjustments to NOAA Methodology by Task and City Understand Your Baseline Risk Carlsbad Adaptations Del Mar Adaptations Task 1: Select appropriate sea level rise scenarios City vulnerability assessment selected high sea level rise scenario from CoSMoS v3.0. City selected 2050 and 2100 as their planning horizon years, which roughly corresponded with 0.5 meter and 2.0 meter sea level rise from the National Research Council projections (2012). They only provided forecasts for those two years. We predicted intermittent 5-year points using the high USACE curve to fit a quadratic curvilinear regression, and benchmarked the sea level rise curve to the 2050 and 2100 values (0.5m and 2.0m). City vulnerability assessment selected a high sea level rise scenario. They did not project water-level increases. Rather, they used historical coastal flooding events to project the extent of future coastal flooding caused by storm events. Significant flooding equaled today's 10-year storm event. Extreme flooding was considered today's 100-year storm event. They projected future damages by increasing the probability of similar storm occurrences between now and 2100.  Task 2: Develop high water level event scenarios None. We contacted NOAA directly to obtain exceedance probability curve data because the referenced website did not provide data in table format. Did not conduct because future damages were based on increased frequency of current storm events, not increased water depth.  Task 3: Assess exposed infrastructure for the no action scenario Conducted as part of the city vulnerability assessment. They provided us with GIS layers showing extent of coastal flooding. We also considered chronic inundation and bluff erosion.  Conducted as part of the city vulnerability assessment. They provided us with GIS layers showing extent of coastal flooding. We also considered chronic inundation.  While in some ways utilizing Carlsbad and Del Mar’s existing modeling made the cost-benefit analyses simpler, it also yielded challenges when applying the NOAA framework. For example, the Carlsbad Assessment only provided two time points, and both Carlsbad and Del Mar Assessments only considered one sea level rise scenario (high). Thus, we were limited to only comparing action scenarios under the high sea level rise scenario and could not make comparisons under the low or intermediate scenarios. Similarly, since we only possessed modeled impacts for 100-year storm events in 2050 and 2100 in Carlsbad, we had to interpolate damage estimates between years and storm types. Furthermore, since 25  the first time-point modeled was 2050, we did not have information regarding potential impacts before 2050; thus, our analysis in Carlsbad starts at 2050. In Del Mar, we were limited to projecting future damages based on historical events as their modeled layers did not account for future increased water depth. Additionally, we chose to use NOAA’s risk assessment option for both cities to incorporate storm event probabilities. Carlsbad At the direction of city staff, the study area was limited to the coastal area of Carlsbad’s Planning Zone 1, delineated by Buena Vista
