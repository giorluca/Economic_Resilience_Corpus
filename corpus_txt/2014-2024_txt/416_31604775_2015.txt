As citizens faced unemployment and failing wages, they came increasingly to believe that federal, state and local authorities should intervene in the national economy.   Further, for many, the events confirmed, the idea that social inequality would be difficult to address and eradicate.  If the problems that stemmed from social inequality and economic crisis were to be solved, then efforts had to be made to redistribute wealth more equitably, and regulate the market so that some measure of fair competition and uniform standard pervaded.   During the presidencies of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, these ideas were tested and expanded.  Even though their administrations created new government agencies to deal with specific aspects of the continuing economic depression, debates over the adequacy and appropriateness of government intervention in the private economy dominated public life and discourse.   The subject of this dissertation is to explore the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933, its origins, and its significance as it paved the way for dynamic economic and                                                            1 Christina D.

The National Industrial Recovery Act was designed to target high unemployment rates in the private sector and improve wages through the use of industry codes.3  It, also, reduced child labor, which enabled American corporations to hire more able-bodied and older Americans.  Tentatively, it established collective bargaining rights that allowed some workers to negotiate for better labor conditions and benefits.  These policies aided citizens participating in the labor market, where they could make more money and earn a higher standard of living.  In its design, the NRA differed from the beggar-thy-neighbor policies of the early years of the depression that reduced the prices of consumer goods and commodities, due to excessive competition in industrial sectors and stagnant wages.4  Even as the national economy became more consumer-oriented, the Roosevelt administration did not want to leave working and middle class citizens on the wrong side of the financial road.   President Roosevelt believed in an expanded role for the federal government, while his predecessor, Herbert Hoover relied chiefly on the private sector to take control of recovery efforts, with the limited federal government assistance.5  The Roosevelt administration acted on the belief that a laissez-faire national economy had not and could                                                            3 Meg Jacobs, Pocketbook Politics:  Economic Citizenship in Twentieth Century America (Princeton:  Princeton University Press, 2005), 107-109. 4 Frederic F.

Given the scale of the economic crisis, the federal government had to step in.  This dissertation seeks to clarify the role of the Roosevelt administration in pursuing that line in comparison to its predecessor, Herbert Hoover.6  The National Recovery Administration was a central political agency in this process and enabled Roosevelt to approve dynamic changes to the national economy and manufacturing sector.  Without the NRA, industrial codes, and other economic and industrial reforms would have been non-existent.   Thus, both policymakers played important roles as president in trying to spur economic recovery.  Some scholars argue that Hoover only wanted to support private sector efforts.  He declined to support an expansion of public works and federal relief as solutions to economic deprivation among American families.7  The majority of historians argue, however, that the belief in limited government had to change if the United States was to move forward and revitalize the national economy.8           Scholarly and Historical Context                                                            6 Ellis Hawley, Herbert Hoover and the Crisis of American Capitalism, ix.  Most Republican policymakers following the Harding administration argued for public works, but only during times of economic depression.  In 1928, Hoover campaigned on the premise that, during times of plenty, revenues should be set aside for periods of economic stress, which led to the promotion of public works projects that stimulated high employment levels. 7 Statement Announcing a Series of Conferences with Representatives of Business, Industry, Agriculture and Labor, The Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Volume 1:  Herbert Hoover, November 15, 1929, Herbert Hoover Papers; Herbert Hoover Presidential Library website, West Branch, Iowa. 8 Please see the following sources that are used throughout the dissertation:   John Kenneth Galbraith and Liaguat Ahamed are two scholars who focus on the roles of the stock market, central bankers and other economic actors to discover the causes of the Stock Market Crash of 1929.  Herbert Hoover in his memoirs and pamphlets discussed how American Individualism shaped American thought about conservative fiscal and financial values that dominated American core values.  William E. Leuchtenburg and Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., chronicled the events leading to the emergence of the Great Depression; and how the Roosevelt administration responded and resolved this economic crisis.  Charles Dearing, Clair Wilcox and Frederick Roos documented the organizational structure of the NRA and the many other executive branch agencies used to address the economic emergency of the 1930s. 4    After World War I, the United States became a creditor nation.9  American businesses and banks lent Western European countries capital to rebuild and revitalize their national economies.10  Advocates of expanded foreign loans believed that they benefited the global economic system.  Most state and national banks were members of the Federal Reserve System, and they did not believe that they had over-extended themselves in terms of the extent of the domestic loans or those to Great Britain and other European countries.11  Overextension of credit, and the expansion of government guarantees for loans meant that the federal government was at risk of defaulting on its own debt, especially if gold reserves were minimal or limited.  Problems with the gold standard, foreign debt, and the issue of monetary contraction domestically, thus, were among the central reasons for the Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression.12 Scholars such as H. Parker Willis and Liaguat Ahamed have argued that the Federal Reserve was mistaken that intergovernmental loans in the 1920s would permanently enhance and promote economic growth in the United States.  In the short term, economic prosperity did occur and Americans did experience dynamic change.  In the long term, the loans were detrimental to the economic health of the United States especially as European nations defaulted on their public credit accounts.  The Great Crash of 1929, this school of thought argued, was caused by the snowball effect of defaults on domestic and                                                            9 Arthur M.

In contrast, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., in The Age of Roosevelt, asserted that the Federal Reserve contributed to the crisis by increasingly restricting such loans.  George Harrison, president of the New York Branch of the Federal Reserve System after 1928, pressured the Federal Reserve Board of Washington, D.C., to tighten the money supply.  He warned American banks to discontinue the practice of establishing cheap money policy and easy credit that had underwritten widespread speculation in the Stock Market by the late 1920s.14 As economic distress increased in the late 1920s, the Hoover administration argued for intergovernmental reforms for the purposes of promoting free trade and other agreements, such as establishing the economic moratorium that provided some financial relief to post-war Germany.  Hoover believed in global growth and argued that the developing economic crisis was an international issue as well as domestic.  He also believed that trade policy might be used to stimulate growth.15  Moreover, Hoover contended that the economic crisis had not originated in the United States; but he looked abroad for the financial roots of the crisis.16  Neither the Great Crash of 1929 nor the Banking crisis of the 1930s, which sparked the emergence of the Great Depression, changed Hoover’s mind.                                                            13 Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover:  The Great Depression, 1929-1941 (New York:  Macmillan Company, 1952), 8; Maury Klein, “The Stock Market Crash of 1929:  A Review Article,” The Business History Review 75, no. 2 (Summer 2001):  326-327;“The Age of Monty and Ben,” The Economist, December 22, 1990; “Blind Spots:  Central Bankers in History,” The Economist, January 10, 2009. 14 Arthur M.

He sought to sustain the gold standard to stabilize prices for consumer goods and exchange rates.17  His policies were, in some respects, contradictory.  He opposed expanding the federal government as an economic foundation of individual welfare.  He, also, believed in decreased spending, an enlarged tax base, and self-help for all Americans.  He emphasized globalization, despite the domestic crisis, and asserted that the United States could not remain isolated from the rest of the world.18  In doing so, he distinguished federal intervention in the global economy and corporate support from individual welfare.  But one question that remains unresolved was whether Hoover or Roosevelt attempted to use Woodrow Wilson’s perspective on the rising phenomenon of globalization to target reforms to the national economy following the Great Crash of 1929?    The issues of globalization and expanding the money supply were among the main arguments behind the Reconstruction Finance Corporation credited under Hoover during the banking crisis of the early 1930s.19  With the RFC, Hoover argued that American businesses could obtain loans to improve upon the production of manufactured goods,                                                            17 Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover:  The Great Depression, 1929-1941 (New York:  Macmillan Company, 1952), vi, 1-2, 7-8; Winifred Wandersee, Women’s Work and Family Values, 1920-1940 (Cambridge:  Harvard University Press, 1981), 32.  Wandersee argues that after the Great Crash of 1929, the cost of living in the United States decreased and consumer goods became less expensive. 18 Dexter Perkins, “Woodrow Wilson:  An Interpretation,” Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series 29 (1947):  128-129. 19 J.

By 1932, many political figures believed that Hoover’s public policies, especially the RFC, were efforts to increase government spending while avoiding expenditures to provide public relief.  As historian Gerald D. Nash has argued, during the negotiation process for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Hoover continued to assert that voluntary efforts in the private sector were sufficient to spur economic growth and deal with unemployment.  He hoped the RFC would, indirectly, add new jobs in the American labor market.  While Hoover supported limited government intervention to stimulate investment, he was not a proponent of public sector growth and relief, with the exception of limited expenditures for public works. 20 For the economic observer, the problem in trying to expand available credit in the early 1930s was compounded by the fact that the Hoover administration supported a renewed metallic standard in the United States and globally.21  This economic stance was problematic, because gold and silver coinage promoted deflation and further depressed prices.  Further, the Hoover administration’s monetary policy in the late 1920s led directly to a contraction of credit in the private sector, as corporate banks and corporations reduced the money supply.22  Despite arguments to the contrary, Hoover stubbornly                                                            20 Gerald D Nash, “Herbert Hoover and the Origins of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,” The Mississippi Valley Historical Review 46, no. 3 (December 1959):  455. 21 William Leuchtenburg, FDR and the New Deal (New York:  Harper & Row, 1963), 31; Elliot A.

Bordo et al., The Defining Moment:  The Great Depression and the American Economy in the Twentieth Century (Chicago:  The University of Chicago Press, 1991), 8-9. 8    reaffirmed his belief in the value of gold to global exchange rates and the importance of stable prices for consumer goods.23 The economic crisis had, however, altered the context for monetary policy.  Hoover’s efforts to balance the federal budget and the emphasis placed upon financial and material assistance from private charities failed to address the needs of ordinary American citizens who suffered from a crippled national economy.24  During his presidency, Hoover wondered about the gold standard as a mechanism for depressed exchange rates.  He did not want to leave a metallic standard but he retracted the money stock, because he was concerned with gold flight.25   Hoover’s policies may have contributed to the emergence of the Great Depression as a global event, because many nations were affected by his restrictive American monetary policy.  Moreover, all nations, especially Western countries, maintained interconnected monetary policies that tied nations together for the sake of economic survival and prosperity.  By the end of Hoover’s presidency, many economists, political leaders, and ordinary citizens believed that the economic crisis required the intervention of the federal government and a new monetary standard.26  Policymakers and ordinary American citizens both sought the means to address unemployment and to ameliorate the poverty and displacement that resulted.  Consequently, the Roosevelt administration made moves to use public sector goods to bolster the private economy.  The Roosevelt administration became involved in regulating the manufacturing sector through policies that would,                                                            23 Arthur M.

Vowing broad experimentation in policy, the Roosevelt administration pushed through a full slate of sweeping legislation, including the National Industrial Recovery Act.28  Through a newly created National Recovery Administration, the government sought to increase economic growth through improved wages in the private and public sectors.  In theory, the agency should have increased the purchasing power of American citizens and bolstered employment levels in the United States.  With more money in the hands of ordinary citizens, they could participate in the market place and acquire goods that sustained or improved upon their standard of living.  Furthermore, the cutthroat competition that had driven overproduction and simultaneously lowered prices would be addressed through cooperation in industry.  Government, industry, and--to a limited extent--labor negotiated codes and thus participated in recovery.29 The economic well-being of American workers became one of the focal points of government policy under the newly-elected president Franklin D. Roosevelt.  In his book, The Great Depression, Robert McElvaine argues that economic individualism had influenced                                                            27 Franklin Roosevelt’s Statement on the National Industrial Recovery Act (June 16, 1933), Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library & Museum website, http://www.docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/odnirast.html, author:  Staff of the Roosevelt Library, version date 2015, (accessed January 23, 2015); The Social Welfare History Project, “The National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 Signed into Law on June 16, 1933,” http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/eras/national-industrial-recovery-act-of-1933/ (accessed January 23, 2015). 28 Sidney M.

Indeed, he did not embrace Keynesian economic theory, but he believed that financial and material relief programs were important factors in preventing the destitution of the American workers.31  As historians have long claimed, Roosevelt received pragmatic approval in addressing these problems. After the presidential election in November of 1932, Roosevelt sought to address the crisis in different ways from the prior administration and thus changed the American political landscape.  During his first one hundred days, FDR used his political mandate to pass a series of economic reforms and stimulus programs, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the Emergency Banking Act.  The National Industrial Recovery Act was the culmination of Roosevelt’s efforts to stem the economic crisis and put Americans back to work.  Further, Roosevelt, as a product of the progressive drive to reform the national economy and promote better social conditions for all Americans, saw his national economic policies as a means of addressing not just the economic crisis, but also lasting inequality.  Viewed by some conservatives as “traitor to his                                                            30 Robert S.

In the United States, there were two economic visions that pervaded until the Great Depression.  A laissez-faire system with independent businessmen was on one hand, while Christian Capitalism and its emphasis on morality and ethical tenets existed with compassionate men leading the charge against social and economic decay.  Hoover believed in both Americas, and sought to use both premises to design social and economic reforms. 31 Special Report, “Text of Roosevelt’s Message to Congress, Chicago Daily Tribune, January 5, 1935.  In this State of the Union speech, Roosevelt confirmed that American workers should have some rudimentary socioeconomic rights such as housing, and a higher standard of living, and that Congress should enact laws that enabled these economic and social dreams occur.  Moreover, the federal government, during times of need, should provide Americans with relief even if this was not initially budgeted by the various branches of government. 11    class,” Roosevelt believed in the “common man” and sought to provide ordinary Americans with relief and emergency financial support.32 The National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933, was an important effort that paved the way for dynamic change and attempted to resolve the national emergency in the United States.  It sought first to address those competitive practices that contributed to the emergence of economic deprivation and collapse.33  The law restructured the national economy and its industrial sectors to create a new environment characterized by high employment in the labor market that ideally benefited American workers and consumers.  The New Deal also changed the ways in which the public sector viewed those who worked, and it provided working and middle class Americans with opportunities to petition their employers for better working conditions and benefits.   Roosevelt had a sense of action to address the people’s concerns and Americans had more confidence in his administration to mitigate the crippling effects of the Depression.34 Under the leadership of the Roosevelt administration, Congress passed the National Industrial Recovery Act and modeled the new NRA on the War Industries Board (WIB) that had been established after the United States entered the First World War in 1917.  The WIB had been the first attempt of elected officials to link a centralized planning approach to economic policy in the United States’ government.35 The WIB was responsible for the                                                            32 Frances Perkins, The Roosevelt I Knew (New York:  The Viking Press, 1946), 71, 154, 166; Philip A.

American policymakers strove to ensure that American soldiers were well cared for and had the necessary tools and equipment to fight the Central powers in Europe.36  Lastly, the WIB was concerned with the pricing of commodities and other materials used by military forces so that stock levels were maintained and managed efficiently.  The NRA used many of these innovations in seeking to address the imbalances within the market and the economy.  More importantly, the NIRA was the first federal law enacted that promoted centralized planning of the national economy during peacetime.   Historian William Leuchtenburg has argued that the NIRA was an important law that enabled American policymakers in the Roosevelt administration to win the war against the Great Depression.37  This critical period in American history was described using war mobilizations metaphor.  The Great Depression was what Roosevelt described as the analogue of war, and it had to be eradicated through the creation of federal agencies including the National Recovery Administration.  This metaphor enabled Americans to rally behind New Deal programs, establish a common sense approach to ending the crisis, promote the national interest, and end all opposition to new policies.  It enabled a new crop                                                            36 Leo Wolman, “The Statistical Work of the War Industries Board,” Publications of the American Statistical Association 16, no. 125 (March 1919):  249, 252-253.

One must also mention that American corporate executives and policymakers wanted to re-establish the WIB to serve as an apparatus to combat the Great Depression.  The WIB and the 1917-1918 wartime mobilization were viewed as examples of cooperation and successful coordination to defeat the Central powers, and now these same types of institutions were to defeat poverty and destitution during the interwar period in the United States. 13    of American scholars in public sector agencies to mobilize and fight against unemployment and poverty during the Depression years.38   The National Industrial Recovery Act’s principal strategy in confronting the crisis was to centralize industrial planning to address the negative effects of competition on the economy and to help stabilize the boom-and-bust cycle that had led to the crisis.  The NRA’s fair codes of competition further enabled policymakers and corporate executives to work together to regulate the various industries in the United States to stave off overproduction, the corrosive effect of competitive price wars, and the long-term effects of corporate monopoly on prices, wages, and working conditions.39  In addition, while highly contested, NIRA’s section 7(a) established the right to collective bargaining, and thus trade unionism in the United States.40  The role of the federal government, with the passage of the NIRA expanded dramatically; and working Americans benefited from some of the industrial rights under the National Labor Board and the NRA.  Section 7(a) was essential to the NIRA, because it was the first attempt by policymakers to manage and regulate workplace conditions and expand employee rights and benefits in effect, to create “industrial democracy.”                                                              38 William Leuchtenburg, The FDR Years, 35, 39. 39 Jim Powell, “How FDR Prolonged the Great Depression,” CATO Policy Report, http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy-report/v25n4/powell.pdf.

LaGuardia introduced this important bill, which had an enormous impact on worker relations in the private sector.  This law enabled workers to strike without interruption for better working conditions, wages and benefits.  It prohibited corporate executives from relying on labor injunctions to get their employees back to work in cases of labor disapproval.42  The law had a significant influence on future legislation, such as the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and the National Labor (Wagner) Relations Act of 1935.  Moreover, the new NIRA law differed from earlier federal policy, and especially from the Hoover administration’s reform strategies, which had stressed corporate subsidies and private relief.43  Section 7(a) had a regenerative effect on the labor movement, because it enabled American workers to collectively bargain to rectify worker grievances, factory conditions, and dissatisfaction with the labor market. Literature Review This dissertation differs from the works of prominent global historians that may have focused entirely on foreign policy, such as Martin Kitchen, and Charles Poor Kindleberger; labor and the history of American consumers, such as Lizabeth Cohen; the                                                            41 Industrial Workers of the World, “The Basic Labor Laws (United States of America,” http://www.iww.org/organize/laborlaw/lynd/lynd3.shtml.

Kennedy; the political and economic agendas of the New Deal, such as Alan Brinkley, Eric Rauchway, Ellis Hawley, William E. Leuchtenburg, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s presidency, such as Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr and Bernard Asbell.  It seeks to examine the business history of American corporations in the automobile and petroleum sectors, and how these businesses were affected by the presidency of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as both policymakers sought to rectify the private sector decline.  This historical account enumerates how geopolitics affected the United States as American corporations, for the first time, were regulated by an expanded federal government.  It illustrates how the federal government became proactive in its economic responses to mitigate the effects of the Great Depression.  It attempts to perform a comparative analysis between the Hoover and Roosevelt presidencies following the Great Crash of 1929 until 1935, and the effects that the federal government’s policies had on American workers as the NIRA and AAA took hold in the United States.   Historical scholarship on the New Deal literature has focused mainly on the Second New Deal period that occurred from 1936 to 1945.  It was during Roosevelt’s second administration that many laws such as the Wagner Act, or National Labor Relations Act of 1935 that validated trade unionism and the Social Security Act that created social insurance were passed.  The First New Deal agenda, in which laws, such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the National Industrial Recovery Act were passed, was in many ways 16    equally important.44  As some historians have argued, it set the template and limitations for federal policy.  In this narrative, I will discuss the major components of the National Recovery Administration and how the various branches of this agency functioned by analyzing primary and secondary source materials.45 The National Archives contain significant amounts of literature on the Consumer Advisory and Industrial Advisory boards that served as important administrative organs within the NRA.  These documents enabled me to scrutinize in more detail the duties and responsibilities of both sub-agencies.  Moreover, the National Archives contains the Donald Richberg Papers.  The Donald Richberg Papers were an essential part of this dissertation, because they enumerate and provide a first-hand account of his actions as general counsel for the NRA.  As readers may recall, Richberg was an influential and successful labor attorney, who played a prominent role in the NRA as general counsel.46  He worked closely with General Hugh Samuel Johnson, who served as the chief administer for the NRA.   In order to paint a more vivid picture of the NRA and how its policies affected the average American worker, this dissertation uses primary source materials from the Reuther Research Archives at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan.47  The Reuther Archives contain New Deal labor newspaper articles, letters, and written essays that activists published in labor magazines and scholarly journals.  It also contains the private                                                            44 Teaching Eleanor Roosevelt Glossary, “Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1882-1945),” http://www.gwu.edu (accessed November 2, 2012). 45 Donald Richberg Papers, November 1934 to June 1935; Papers of the Consumer Advisory Board, 1934-1935, and the Industrial Advisory Board, Records of the National Industry Recovery Board, October 1934; Department of Justice files, October 1934;  National Archives, College Park, Maryland. 46 “Donald Randall Richberg,” University of Minnesota Law Library, The Clarence Darrow Digital Collection, http://www.darrow.law.umn.edu/photo.php?pid=1330, (accessed January 23, 2015); “House Extends Skeleton of NRA,” Chicago Daily Tribune, January 8, 1935. 47 The Mary Van Kleeck, the Mary Heaton Vorse, Harry O’Connor and Robert Dunn Papers, the Reuther Research Archives, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan. 17    papers of New Deal scholars and trade unionists Mary Van Kleeck, Mary Heaton Vorse, Harry O’Connor and Robert Dun, including their manuscripts and documents with descriptive citations and notes on them.  These New Deal scholars’ papers compose a critical portion of the dissertation.  The New Dealers provide enormous detail into the relationship that they had with the federal government, corporations in the private sector and their colleagues throughout organized labor.  Their works allowed me to paint a vivid picture of the Great Depression and how the New Deal paved the way for dynamic changes in the private sector through the enactment of federal regulations that promoted private sector growth.  Contemporaries during the New Deal, such as Charles Roos, Alfred Bernheim and Dorothy Van Doren, Charles L. Dearing and others, and Lois MacDonald, Gladys L. Palmer and Theresa Wolfson; provided readers with detailed information about the agencies of the NRA, how they were organized and the responsibilities of the different internal boards.48  This dissertation relies upon these works as well.  Subsequent analyses have expanded on these early works on the NRA and enumerate some of its deficiencies.   In newspaper coverage from the New York Times and the Chicago Daily Tribune in 1933 and 1934, General Hugh Samuel Johnson and other officials discusses the roles and responsibilities of the NRA.  Some of Johnson’s speeches in which he addresses his critics, were reported in newspapers as well.  The NRA was viewed by many, especially American corporate leaders, as a controversial agency.  These primary sources illustrate in detail how                                                            48 Charles Roos, NRA Economic Planning (Bloomington:  The Principia Press, Inc., 1937), 60-61; Alfred Bernheim and Dorothy Van Doren, Labor and Government:  An Investigation of the Role of Government in Labor Relations (New York:  McGraw-Hill book Company, 1935), 1; Charles Dearing, The ABC of the NRA (Washington, D.C.:  The Brooking Institution, 1934), 41, 44-45, 52, 80-81, 89-90, 116-118, 122  and Lois McDonald, Gladys L. Palmer and Theresa Wolfson, Labor and the NRA (New York:  Affiliated Schools for Workers, Inc., 1934), 1. 18    the NRA officials attempted to weather the political storms that came their way during the process of the carrying out many of their duties.      Beyond the NRA, this dissertation examines the roles of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in bringing about economic and industrial changes during the Great Depression.  Hoover wrote three sets of memoirs that address the Great Crash of 1929, how the Great Depression started, and who should be held responsible.  In them, he described his opposition to the New Deal and the Roosevelt administration’s efforts to resolve the economic crisis.  Hoover’s public papers contain letters, media statements and speeches from his presidency in which he discussed in great detail his economic and political policies.49  Hoover wrote two books, in which he discussed his beliefs in American principles and how they differentiated the United States from the rest of the world.50  For Hoover, these Republican ideals fell by the wayside during the New Deal, because his successor, Roosevelt, espoused central planning of the national economy and social programs, not the self-help that Hoover envisioned and emphasized.  Although this dissertation touches upon Hoover’s role as a food administrator during the First World War, much effort is placed upon defining his responsibilities as Commerce Secretary and President.  His memoirs and public statements enabled me to document his political mindset as a public official and the negative effects that the Great Crash had on his administration.                                                            49 Herbert Hoover Papers, The Public Papers of the Presidents of the United States, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library website, West Branch, Iowa; Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover:  The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933 (New York:  Macmillan Company, 1952), v-vii.  In the preface, Hoover describes the Great Depression as destructive and disastrous years for his administration.  In this introduction, he enumerates the goals of volume two of his memoirs and discusses some of his policy initiatives.  He describes in detail the presidential election of 1932 between himself and Roosevelt; Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover:  The Great Depression, 1929-1941, (New York:  Macmillan Company, 1952), 22, 42, 152-153, 242. 50 Herbert Hoover, American Individualism (New York:  Doubleday, Page & Company, 1922), 19, 24, 32, 48 and New Day:  Campaign Speeches of Herbert Hoover (California:  Stanford University Press, 1928), 31-32, 41. 19    The New Deal era generated a voluminous public record.  Roosevelt’s public papers are much more extensive than Hoover’s, because FDR served four terms as president of the United States.  The archives contain his letters to American and foreign policymakers and corporate leaders, his speeches to the American people, such as his 1932 campaign addresses and some of his Fireside chats, his press releases and public media statements in which he addressed his presidential press corps as well as correspondence with constituent voters.51  Roosevelt’s children along with historian Bernard Asbell published his memoirs and these serve as an indirect method of explaining Roosevelt’s political mindset as he created the New Deal and the NIRA.52  This dissertation will not describe Roosevelt’s private life, such as what Bernard Asbell accomplished in his Roosevelt biography, but will discuss his roles as governor of New York State and president of the United States during a period of profound economic collapse.  It differs from other works because it examines the Roosevelt administration’s expanded role in the private sector as the Executive Branch enacted the NIRA and the AAA.  In addition, it elucidates the duties of Roosevelt and his efforts along with Frances Perkins, Donald Richberg, Harold Ickes and General Hugh Samuel Johnson to redefine the federal government’s private sector responsibilities.  Each policymaker was obligated to work with corporations in the automobile and petroleum sectors to promote industrial growth during a period of economic collapse.   Frances Perkins’ The Roosevelt I Knew examines the roles that she, as labor secretary, played during the negotiations for the NIRA and the professional relationships                                                            51 Collection of the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library website, Presidential papers, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Library, Personal file 1933-1945; Samuel I.

Memoirs (Garden City, New York:  Doubleday, 1973), 63-67. 20    that she maintained with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Hugh Samuel Johnson, Harold Ickes, and Donald Richberg.53  These memoirs reveal the process by which the New Deal was created, and stand as evidence of Roosevelt’s unique approach to policymaking.  Frances Perkins was instrumental to the creation of the NIRA, but this dissertation somewhat departs from her analytical work, because it examines the substantial team effort that it took to enact this important bill.  Her role is muted slightly in this dissertation in an effort to describe the organizational structure of the NRA and its role as a federal regulator for the national economy.    Third, this dissertation discusses how the automobile and petroleum industries in particular were affected by the NIRA.  Historian Sidney Fine, along with Clarence J. Huddleston whose papers contain interviews about the Banking Crisis in Detroit in the 1930s, enumerated the roles of Henry Ford during this period.54  Sidney Fine’s papers contain newspaper articles and accounts of the Edgewater strike in New Jersey during the 1930s, in which Ford workers agitated for the legitimation of trade unionism.  Both Sidney Fine and Clarence J. Huddleston describe Ford Motor Company during the Great Depression and this dissertation differs from their works in that it enumerates the interdependent roles of both Ford Motor Company and General Motors Corporation during the negotiation process for the automobile code.  Sidney Fine focused on Ford Motor Company and its relationship to the NRA but this dissertation seeks to go a little farther to provide more information about the industrial codes that affected the automobile industry from 1933 to 1935.  Additionally, it touches upon how the automobile industry was                                                            53 Frances Perkins, The Roosevelt I Knew (New York:  The Viking Press, 1946), 41-53, 201-202. 54 The Sidney Fine and Clarence J. Huddleston Papers, The Bentley Collection, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. 21    interwoven with the petroleum sector as oil commodities along with the manufactured products from the automobile industry became essential consumer goods for the American people and global citizens.   The Benson Ford Research Collection at the Henry Ford Museum contains account books and ledgers used by management at Ford Motor Company.  They reveal how management functioned under the NIRA.55  The Ford Archives have anonymous letters to Thomas Edison, in which an unknown author advocated against the passage of the NIRA; and discussed the supposed damage that it would cause the automobile sector if enacted.  The Ford Archives have the petroleum and automobile codes in their entirety.  Historians Lonnie Bell, Douglas Brinkley, David L. Lewis, Sidney Fine, and John B. Rae provide readers with snapshots into the origins and history of Ford Motor Company and how this company fared during the New Deal.56  These books also analyze the effects that the NIRA had on its corporate operations and provide detailed analysis.    David Farber’s Sloan Rules illustrates the responsibilities of Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., who served as the president of General Motors until 1956, and his efforts to work with the NIRA.57  However, the history of General Motors is difficult to dissect during the 1930s,                                                            55 Collection of NRA Literature, Bills, Codes; Collection of NRA Miscellaneous Documents; Edsel B.

Sloan’s private documents have been destroyed, and there are only limited primary sources at the GM archives, such as sales account books and ledgers from the 1930s.  Sloan’s manuscript from his My Years with General Motors is on file at the GM archives.58  This book provides readers with first-hand information about the interworkings of General Motors Corporation under his helm.  Moreover, there are many New York Times articles from the summer of 1933 that illustrated the roles of Sloan who served in the NRA’s Industrial Advisory Board.  Sloan’s critical position in the NRA allowed him to shape the board and the agency itself.  This dissertation attempts to illustrate vividly General Motors Corporation during the Great Depression and fills in the gaps in this company’s historiography throughout this critical period in the United States.     In addition, Ed Cray’s Chrome Colossus discusses some corporate aspects of GM, but it relies solely on newspaper articles from the period and limited private correspondence.59  Farber’s Sloan Rules examines more primary source materials, such as letters between Sloan and Roosevelt and other New Deal policymakers, and has a host of secondary source material.  Kettering University, which had been named previously General Motors Institution in Flint, Michigan, has some New Deal primary source materials, such as letters, corporate documents and account books; but their records are limited, because of the paucity of surviving GM documentation.60  Douglas Reynolds and Ernest Dale chart the                                                            58 Alfred P.

Sloan, Jr., who had a powerful automotive mind and his efforts to work with the Roosevelt administration during the New Deal period.61 In terms of the petroleum industry, the literature is rich with detail.  This dissertation is somewhat similar to prior works from Donald R. Brand and Norman E. Nordhauser that describe the petroleum industry during the Great Depression and provide expanded views of the negotiation process for the oil code throughout 1933.  Many corporate executives and governors especially from the Southwest, were mentioned in Congressional hearings for the NIRA.  The oil industry in the 1930s is further discussed thoroughly in many newspapers, such as the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, the Chicago Daily Tribune and the Los Angeles Times.  The Department of Justice also contains some files about the Teapot Dome crisis from 1921 to 1924 and how the petroleum industry fared, because of this political event in the years before the Depression.  In the 1930s, this crisis was overshadowed by the emergence of the Great Depression.   There were some efforts by Harold Ickes to regulate the oil industry and to apply the petroleum code to corporations in this sector.  In Fightin’ Oil and The Secret Diary of Harold I. Ickes, Ickes discussed his efforts at reforming the petroleum industry; but he mainly illustrates his role in the logistics and shipping of oil to American soldiers fighting in Europe during the Second World War.62  Ickes’ memoirs describe his political life during the heart of the New Deal from 1933 to 1936.  Norman E. Nordhauser, and the National Petroleum News cover the development and shifts in the petroleum industry during the                                                            61 Douglas Reynolds, “Engines of Struggle:  Technology, Skill and Unionization at General Motors, 1930-1940,” Michigan Historical Review 15, no. 1 (Spring 1989):  69-92; Ernest Dale, “Contributions to Administration by Alfred P.

Nash examines the negotiations for the petroleum code while Donald R. Brand described the petroleum industry during the New Deal and how the industry faced difficult challenges with the enactment of the NIRA.64  Collectively, these works help to provide a picture of the NRA through two of its most important target industries.  This dissertation relies heavily on these works about the petroleum industry during the Great Depression and describes how price and production controls were debated upon and negotiated during the hearings for the oil code throughout the summer months of 1933. Dissertation Chapter Review Ideally, this dissertation will contribute to the historical and political debate about the New Deal, its successes and its failures, by examining the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933.  This dissertation scrutinizes its implementation and effects, and its demise after the landmark Supreme Court decision in Schechter v. the United States in 1935.  First, this document outlines the problems that faced the Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt administrations and their efforts to redress the effects of the economic crisis that took place from 1929 onward.  All of the chapters attempt to link the political and economic events of the 1920s, such as the Great Crash and the emergence of the Great Depression in the 1930s to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s efforts to target reforms to redress the industrial and economic crisis.  Much effort is devoted to                                                            63 Norman E.

By focusing on the events that led to the enactment of the NIRA and AAA, readers can comprehend more thoroughly the need for the federal regulations inherent in both laws.  The American economy was in a shambles and this dissertation enumerates the differing roles of the presidency as both Hoover and Roosevelt sought to devise solutions to the industrial and economic crisis.    In Chapter Two, I focus on how the petroleum and automobile industries fared during the 1920s, before and during the Great Crash of 1929.  This chapter will examine how both sectors expanded their international market-share as the federal government sought to create the conditions for economic growth.  The chapter will discuss Ford Motor Company, General Motors Corporations, and the myriad of petroleum companies.  The chapter illustrates how both industries developed global relations as they expanded their business operations.  It will discuss the important issues, such as conservation, production, technology, corporate and market innovations, and labor relations, that affected corporations in the petroleum and automobile industries. Chapter Three discusses the Great Crash of 1929 and the coming of the Great Depression in the 1930s.  Scholars believe that there were many reasons for these financial crises.  Under-consumption, overproduction in American industries, technological innovation in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, and the price instability of manufactured goods were the key industrial causes of the economic crises.  The national economy’s problems with a metallic standard, the lack of programs to address the crisis under President Herbert Hoover, the promotion of private charities and a balanced federal budget, Stock Market speculation, and the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve System 26    were implicated in the continued economic, social and monetary crises of the 1930s.  Thus, the national economy was changing under the Hoover administration, but it could not respond effectively in large part due to Hoover’s lack of flexibility, while the Roosevelt administration addressed the crisis with Keynesian policies that Roosevelt termed “experimentation.”  FDR decided to act for the American people and reform the diverse elements of the national economy.65  Chapter Four addresses arguments about a laissez-faire approach to the crisis in the United States as well as the introduction of alternative economic ideas and policies.  It further follows the scope and range of political responses to the economic crisis.  Both Hoover and Roosevelt maintained divergent political views about the national economy.
