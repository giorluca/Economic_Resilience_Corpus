But another profound emergency is the planet'sunfolding environmental crisis of climate change. Climate change disruption is getting to the point of no return. Wemust act decisively to protect our planet from both the COVID-19 and the existential problem of climate interruption.We need to turn the COVID-19 economic recovery process into a real opportunity to do things right for the future. Theeconomic and social devastation caused by climate disruption will be many times greater than the currentCOVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic-which is resulting in significant economic and political shiftsworldwide, should be the international community's unique window of opportunity in which recoveryplans can be instrumental in creating a more sustainable and resilient future through ambitious climate mitigation,adaptation, and financing aimed at building back better. This article, which adopted the doctrinal researchmethodology, examines how the global environmental problem of climate change can be tackled throughCOVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages. The paper finds that focusing COVID-19 economic recoverystimulus packages on greener economy, renewable energies, circular economy, and reforestation can help tacklethe global environmental problem of climate change. Further, the paper finds that there is a need for legalframeworks that guarantee investments in the suggested strategic areas taking insights from the EuropeanCommission Green Deal policy framework. This paper recommends that national governments and internationalfinancial lending institutions should focus their COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages on investmentsthat tackle the global environmental problem of climate change.Keywords: Global environmental problem, climate change, COVID-19, economic recovery, stimulus packages,legal strategies, European Commission Green DealDOI: 10.7176/JLPG/123-06Publication date:August 31st 20221. INTRODUCTIONThe COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need for the global community to urgently address the globalenvironmental problem of climate change that have a related capability to seriously destabilize the systems thatallow humanity and the planet to survive and thrive.1 Although, COVID-19 is the most urgent threat currentlyfacing humanity, we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term.2As the pandemic has affected businesses, families, and economies globally, governments have moved quickly tocontrol the spread, initiating sweeping changes to the manner we live our lives. Climate change, on the otherhand, presents a far more significant risk to humankind, and yet our response has been much slower.COVID-19 has strike speedily and according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), as at the 25th ofAugust 2022, accounts for 6,457,101 deaths globally.3 Climate change has been, to a great extent, more gradual.However, the WHO has noted that the impacts of climate change could lead to about 250,000 yearly deaths*Lecturer, Department of Public and International Law, College of Law, Bowen University, Osun State, Nigeria.

Also, data released in a report inthe New England Journal of Medicine hint that climate change could compel 100 million people into extremepoverty by 2030, causing them to be more vulnerable to health problems. Due to climate change-associated foodshortages, we could see additional 529,000 adult deaths by 2050.1To tackle COVID-19, we need to build strong health systems and to stay at home. To tackle climate change,we need much more transformational solutions. We need to transit to sustainable production and consumption.2Unsustainable production and consumption caused by brown financing,3 investments, and lifestyle choices haveresulted in a depletion of natural resources, disruption of ecosystems, resource and carbon-intensive economiesand infrastructures, and environmental health issues and diseases.4 We need to alter the method we produce andconsume goods and services, including how we produce and consume energy, how we travel, the way we eat,and the way we live. And that is an enormous undertaking. So, what is the next step? First, we must ensure thatthe substantial COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages that governments are devising to supporteconomies, companies, and people during the pandemic also tackle climate change.5 In other words, puttingenvironmental preservation and restoration through climate action at the centre of the COVID-19 economyrecovery stimulus packages is the ideal place to begin.6The need for climate action is urgent. COVID-19 may be currently taking centre stage, but climate changeis still waiting in the wings. Coastal regions are already enduring devastating floods, coastal erosion, sea-levelrise, and extreme weather events linked to climate change.7 2019 is believed to be the second-hottest year onrecord, capping off a five-year time that ranks as the warmest span in documented history. The effects are real:hurricanes, wildfires, and floods cost the world $150 billion in 2019 alone. Insurance companies signified thatbusiness losses and the economy-before COVID-19 hit-were before now expected to rise due to a decade-longincrease in natural catastrophes with direct links to climate change.8Heads of government9 and international financial lending institutions such as the World Bank and theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) are providing trillions of dollars in COVID-19 economic recovery stimulusfunding to keep economies going.10 The United States, on 27th March 2020, enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) as part of measures to tackle the health and economic effects of thecrisis through the provision of financial assistance for businesses11 and reliefs to support citizens through cash-in-hand programmes directly.12 In China, the Ministry of Finance issued 1.08 trillion CNY (USD 150 billion) of1Maria Mendiluce, Why we must address COVID-19 and Climate Change <https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/wh y-we-must-address-covid-19-climate-change-mar%25C3%25ADa-mendiluce/?trackingId=9Zyual9Sf8E1dYoy 0yYnxw%3D%3D> accessed 7 August 2020; SeeCOVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic Cases <https://www.worl dometers.info/coronavirus/> accessed 7 August 2020.2COVID-19: Four Sustainable Development Goals that help Future-Proof Global Recovery, supra note 1.3Brown Financing describes domestic and international finance flows from both public and private sources that support carbon-intensiveprojects or activities and pathways that do not sufficiently consider future climate risks.

The United Kingdom haspassed the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (UK Coronavirus Act, 2020), which permits companies to applyfor government support to cover up to 80% of furloughed workers’ wages, capped at £2,500 monthly.1 TheRussian government has enacted a 300-billion ruble ($4 billion) Anti-Crisis Fund to give tax breaks for airlinesand companies in the tourism sector and preferential loans to businesses as part of the Covid-19 economicrecovery package measures to help the country’s economic recovery.2 The Australian government has passed theCoronavirus Economic Response Package Omnibus Bill 2020 designed to lessen the economic impact of Covid-19 as a result of cash flow constraints on Australian companies experiencing financial distress, reduce theclosure of Australian businesses and avoid company collapses.3However, the need to urgently revive economic activity is fuelling concerns that this could come at theexpense of environmental sustainability. Every nation's economic plans and policies are rightly pivoting todealing with COVID-19 and its effects. But as economies are revived, now is the right time to make up for pastomissions and rebuild them in a way that takes the environment’s real value into account.4 With the worldspeedily reaching the point when climate disorder becomes inevitable, how the trillions of COVID-19 economicrecovery stimulus funds are spent is a use-it-or-lose-it moment, so what the governments do matters. Climatechange is a universal crisis, meaning all nations must act.5Thus, calls for COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages that will support rather than undermine theworldwide effort to tackle the environment and climate change crisis are growing.6 For instance, the IMFManaging Director, Kristalina Georgieva, has called for fiscal responses to COVID-19 to tackle climate change.According to her, the massive economic recovery fiscal stimulus measures adopted by governments worldwideto fight the COVID-19 pandemic must be adapted to tackle climate change at the same time.7 Many otherenvironmental advocates are particularly demanding that bailout incentives for industrial manufacturers andtransportation companies include provisions for massive emissions reductions in their future operations.82.

This includes both the biological and physical aspects of theenvironment. One of the major global environmental problems that is causing immense concern to humanity isclimate change.32.2. Climate ChangeAccording to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), "Climate change"means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the compositionof the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable timeperiods.4 It is a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced bythe use of fossil fuels.5 Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift inthose average conditions.6 It is a long-term change in the average weather patterns that have come to defineEarth’s local, regional and global climates.7 Climate change is also seen as the global phenomenon of climatetransformation characterized by the changes in the usual climate of the planet (regarding temperature,precipitation, and wind) that are especially caused by human activities.82.3. COVID-19COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronaviruscalled severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).9 Empire10 has noted that the COVID-19,first reported in Wuhan-the capital of Hubei Province of China in December 2019, is a human tragedy that iscurrently affecting millions of people around the globe. Presently, about 215 countries have reported cases ofCOVID-19. The WHO on January 30, 2020, announced COVID-19 as a pandemic and on March 11, 2020 listedit as a public health emergency of global concern. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily from person to personthrough droplets of saliva or discharge released from the nose when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.It may also be spread by touching a surface with the virus on it and then touching one’s mouth, nose, or eyes, butthis is less common. The most common signs and symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and troublebreathing. Fatigue, muscle pain, chills, headache, sore throat, runny nose, nausea or vomiting, diarrhoea, and aloss of taste or smell may also occur. The signs and symptoms may be mild or severe and usually appear 2 to 14days after exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Older adults and people with serious underlying medicalproblems, such as heart, lung, or kidney disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, cancer, or a weak immunesystem are more likely to develop serious illness.112.4. Economic RecoveryAn economic recovery is a period of economic expansion, typically after a recession.12 During this period,economic and business activity is improving. Usually, it is characterized by positive economic growth, improvedincome, and employment prospects.13 In an economic recovery, businesses will see an increase in demand andwill start hiring. People will begin going back to work, confidence will start to increase and consumers will start1What is global environmental research <https://www.env.go.jp/en/earth/research/gerf_E/frm002.htm> accessed 26 August 2021.2Environmental-issues meaning <https://www.yourdictionary.com/environmental-issues> accessed 25 August 2021.3Other global environmental problems include depletion of the ozone layer, decrease of biodiversity, marine pollution, deforestation(especially tropical forests), trans-border transportation of hazardous wastes, acid rain, desertification, etc. See What is global environmentalresearch, supra note 24; Types of Environmental Issues <https://www.toppr.com/guides/ biology/environmental-issues/types-of-environmental-issues/> accessed 26August2021.4Article 1(2), UNFCCC, 1992.5Climate Change <https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+climate+change&rlz=1C1CHBD_enNG943NG943&oq=WHAT+IS+CLIMATE+CHANGE&aqs=chrome.0.0i20i263i433i512j0i512l9.12299j0j15&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8>accessed 26 August 2021.6‘What is climate change?

The recovery starts when the recessionbottoms out and ends once the economy has recovered all the gains that were lost. It then gives way to a new eraof expansion and a fresh peak.22.5. Stimulus PackagesStimulus package is a package of economic measures or intervention (tax rebates and incentives) used by thegovernments of various countries to stimulate a struggling economy and save their country from a financialcrisis.3 Stimulus packages are often used in times when the economy risks entering a recession or when arecession is already under way.4 A stimulus package can be in the form of a monetary stimulus, a fiscal stimulus,or quantitative easing. A monetary stimulus is when interest rates are cut, which in turn encourages more peopleto borrow and puts more money in circulation, thus, stimulating the economy. Lower interest rates may alsocause the weakening of the exchange rate, which can lead to an increase in exports. When exports increase, moremoney enters the economy, encouraging spending and stimulating the economy. A fiscal stimulus is whengovernment cuts taxes, increases its spending, or both in a bid to revive the economy. When taxes are cut, peoplehave more income (income) at their disposal to spend, which boosts demand, production, and economic growth.When the government increases its spending, it injects more money into the economy, which decreasesthe unemployment rate, increases spending, and, eventually, counters the impact of a recession. Quantitativeeasing is a type of expansionary monetary policy which occurs when the central bank of a country purchases alarge number of financial assets, such as bonds, from commercial banks and other financial institutions, in orderto expand excess reserves, encourage lending, lower yields and interest rates and increase the supply of money incirculation.52.6. StrategiesA strategy is a general plan or set of plans intended to achieve something, especially over a long period.6 It couldalso mean a plan of action intended to accomplish a specific goal.7 It defines a specific course of action that willtake you from where you are now to where you want to be.8 Strategy is a high level plan to achieve one or moregoals under conditions of uncertainty. Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve thesegoals are usually limited.9 A good strategy provides a clear roadmap consisting of a set of guiding principles orrules that defines the actions people in business, government, organization, etc should take (and not take) and thethings they should prioritize (and not prioritize) to achieve desired goals.103. RATIONALE FOR TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH COVID-19 ECONOMICRECOVERY STIMULUS PACKAGESCarbon dioxide lingers in the atmosphere for centuries and this implies that the world is committed to sustainedclimate change regardless of any temporary decrease in emissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.11 Thus,there is nothing to celebrate in a likely decline in emissions driven by the COVID-19 economic crisis. In theabsence of the right policies and structural measures, this decline will not be sustainable.12 Thus, a global effortto leverage COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus spending to catalyze climate ambition is a win-winproposition when it comes down to the wide use of public money that the world cannot afford to overlook.131Definition of Economic Recovery <https://www.davemanuel.com/investor-dictionary/economic-recovery/> accessed 27 August 2021.2What is an economic recovery and what are the types? <https://www.ig.com/en/trading-strategies/what-is-an-economic-recovery-and-what-are-the-types-200612> accessed 27 August 2021.3Definition of 'Stimulus Package' The Economic Times, 26 August 2021.4Adam Hayes, Stimulus Package Definition <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stimulus-package.asp> accessed 26 August 2021.5What is a Stimulus Package <https://gocardless.com/en-us/guides/posts/stimulus-package-meaning/> accessed 2 August 2021; EconomicStimulus Package <https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/econ omics/economic-stimulus-package/> accessed 27 August2021.6Meaning of Strategy <https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/strategy> accessed 27 August 2021.7Strategy meaning <https://www.yourdictionary.com/strategy> accessed 27 August 2021.8Kristina H, What Is Strategy (and Why Should You Care)? <https://www.braintraffic.com/insights/what-is-strategy-and-why-should-you-care> accessed 27 August 2021.9Definitions for Strategy <https://www.definitions.net/definition/strategy> accessed 27 August 2021.10Michael D.W, ‘Demystifying Strategy: The What, Who, How, and Why’ Harvard Business Review, September 10, 2007.11COVID-19 and the Environment, supra note 2.12Jillian Ambrose, ‘Coronavirus poses threat to Climate Action, says Watchdog’ The Guardian (London, 12 March 2020)<https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/12/coronovirus-poses-threat-to-climate-acti on-says-watchdog> accessed 15 May2020.13Jennifer Allan, Announcements are not enough: Concrete Steps for Post-Pandemic Green Future (International Institute for Sustainabledevelopment, 12 May 2020) <http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/announcem ents-are-not-enough-concrete-steps-for-post-pandemic-green-future/> accessed 12 May 2020; Julie Mollins, ‘Reforestation could play Role in Pandemic Recovery Jobs creation, SaysIMF’s Georgieva’ Forest News (Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and Consultative Group on International AgriculturalJournal of Law, Policy and Globalization www.iiste.orgISSN 2224-3240 (Paper) ISSN 2224-3259 (Online)Vol.123, 202250The emergence of a new threat-COVID-19 does not reduce the human and economic risks of the ongoingclimate change crisis, a current threat to human lives, health, and the economy. The decisions governments makeat the moment will lock in the strategic direction of companies and economies in the coming years. Governmentsworking on strategies to rebuild their economies should pair COVID-19 economic recovery action withclimate action to make sure that they, and the companies they support, come out stronger than before. Byapplying a climate and resilience lens to longer-term economic recovery stimulus packages, governments canboost economic growth, create good jobs, help protect against the impacts of climate change through emissionsreduction, ensuring clean air, and increasing resilience to future shocks.1 Now is the time to consider usingCOVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages to support a long-term change to better environmentally andclimate-friendly business and personal practices.2The COVID-19 pandemic may temporarily reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but it is not a substitute forsustained climate action. While COVID-19 has caused harsh international health and economic crisis, failure toaddress climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems, and economies for centuries. We need toflatten both the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change curves and exhibit similar determination and solidarityagainst climate change as against COVID-19. We need to take action collectively in the interests of the healthand welfare of humanity, not merely for the current generation but for many generations ahead. It is, therefore,essential that COVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages help the economy grow back better. Earliereconomic crises have repeatedly been followed by "recovery" associated with much higher emission growth thanbefore the crisis.3 We need to alter that trajectory. The world has to display the same unity and devotion toclimate action and reducing greenhouse gas emissions as to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Failure tomitigate climate change could lead to higher human life and economic losses during the coming decades.4We must use this period of crisis and renewal to build greater resilience and to tackle the biggest threat toour existence-the danger of climate change. Governments have to put climate action at the centre of COVID-19economic recovery stimulus packages. Pairing COVID-19 economic recovery action with climate change actionwill guarantee that economies can grow more robust than before while simultaneously reducing emissions. TheCOVID-19 economic recovery stimulus packages should encourage the speedy deployment of existing climatesolutions and stimulate the development and display of the technologies needed to create an inclusive, resilientnet-zero carbon economy. Governments must offer companies the transparency and confidence they need tounlock additional investments in climate solutions.5In the face of human calamity and the surplus of impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also beengiven an opportunity to rebuild society in a way that makes it more resilient to future crises.

The risk is making nearsighted decisions thatamplify emissions and continue to pollute the environment in the long term. Alternatively, there is anopportunity to champion solutions that not merely rebuild lives and stimulate economic activity in the immediatewake of the pandemic but as well hasten the transition to resilient, low-carbon economies and environment-richsocieties.2 Recovery plans that aggravate climate change would expose investors and national economies toincreasing financial, health, and social risks in the future years. Therefore, governments should shun theprioritization of risky, short-term emissions-intensive projects that will not tackle the environmental problem ofclimate change.3Pairing climate change action with COVID-19 economic recovery action will be reciprocally strengthening:global recovery from COVID-19 can set the world on the pathway for a safe, healthy, just, and sustainable future.By addressing the COVID-19 health and climate change crises together and applying holistic, economy-wideperspectives, the world will not simply "recover better" but as well become healthier, cleaner, and moreprosperous for all people.4 Inaction when it comes to the fight back against adverse climate change is no longeran alternative. Inaction will put in danger all life on Earth as we know it and only lead to harsher and extremeweather events, land degradation and deforestation, loss of biodiversity, pollution, acidification of oceans, globalfood insecurity, drought, and floods.5 The less we do early enough to nip the climate change crisis in the bud, themore problematic and overwhelming it will be later.6The climate change crisis may be viewed as a gradual moving crisis than the speed of the COVID-19 globalpandemic, but its long-term impacts are likely to be far more threatening. Climate change is something we do nothave the science, technology, or funding to solve. Without additional commitments to decarbonisation, the planetis on track for a 3.2-degree global temperature rise and beyond.7 According to Sawin, both the COVID-19pandemic and the climate change crisis are problems of exponential growth against an inadequate capacity todeal with. In the case of the COVID-19, the risk is the number of infected people overpowering health caresystems; with climate change, it is that emissions increase will surpass our ability to manage effects, for example,the increased possibility of pandemics, extreme weather events, droughts, floods, wildfires and widespreaddestabilization of global food, economic and security systems.8 The risk from climate change is as real as the risk1IEA, IEA and Denmark host Ministerial Roundtable discussion on making Clean Energy a key part of the Global Economic Recovery(International Energy Agency, 24 April 2020) <https://www.iea.org/news/iea-and-denmark-host-ministerial-roundta ble-discuss ion-on-making-clean-energy-a-key-part-of-the-global-economic-recovery?utm_content=buffer7dd40&utmmedium=social&utm_source=twitter-ieabirol&utm_campaign=buffer > accessed 9 August 2020; See Kevin Moss, The Coronavirus Pandemic could give Business Leaders aBroader Mandate for Sustainability (World Resources Institute, 9 April 2020) <https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/04/coron avirus-pandemic-could-give-business-leaders-broader-mandate-sustainability> accessed 10 August 2020; See A UN Framework for the Immediate Socio-Economic Response to COVID-19 (United Nations Sustainable Development Group, 2020) p. 3 <https://unsdg.un.org/resources/un-framework-immediate-socio-economic-resp onse-covid-19> accessed 11 August 2020.2Open Letter to Global Leaders – A Healthy Planet for Healthy People-Call to Action from the Planetary Emergency Partnership: Emergingfrom the Planetary Emergency and Partnering between People and Nature (Club of Rome, 26 March 2020) <https://clubofrome.org/impact-hubs/climate-emergency/open-letter-to-global-leaders-a-healthy-planet-for-healthy-people/> accessed 10 August 2020; See AlessandraMazzai, Sustainability or Crisis with GGKP Head Benjamin Simmons (Foresight–The CMCC Observatory on Climate Policies and Futures,6 May 2020) <https://www.climateforesight.eu/jobs-growth/sustainability-or-crisis/> accessed 9 August 2020.3Simon Jessop and Kate Abnett, ‘Rich Nations must make Pandemic Recovery Plans Green: Global Investors’ Reuters (London, 4 May 2020)https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-recovery-investors-idUS KBN22G08Y> accessed 9 August 2020; See Laurie Goering,What COVID-19 can Teach us about Tackling Climate Change (World Economic Forum, 15 May 2020)<https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/covid-19-a pply-battling-climate-change/> accessed 10 August 2020; See Emily Kasriel, A‘Mass Experiment’ for the Climate: Has the Pandemic helped Individuals and Leaders get any Closer to Tackling the Environmental Crisis?’BBC–Future Planet (London, 25 June 2020) <https://www.bbc.com/fut ure/article/20200624-has-covid-19-brought-us-closer-to-stopping-climate-change> accessed August 2020.4Opinion: Now is the Time to build a 21st Century Energy System, supra note 11; See UNEP and ILRI, Preventing the Next Pandemic:Zoonotic diseases and how to break the chain of transmission (United Nations Environment Programme and International LivestockResearch Institute, Nairobi: Kenya, 2020) p. 43 <https :// www.ilri.org/publications/preventing-next-pandemic-zoonotic-diseases-and-how-break-chain-transmission> accessed 7 August 2020.5Tijani Muhammad-Bande, ‘Inaction over Climate Emergency ‘Not an Option’ says UN Assembly Chief’ UN News (New York, 10 January2020) <https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/01/1055171> accessed 7 August 2020; See WMO, Earth Day highlights Climate Action: COVID-19 Exacerbates Socio-Economic Impacts of Climate Change, Which Accelerated In Past 5 Years (World Meteorological Organization,22 April 2020) <https://publi c.wmo.int/en/me dia/press-release/earth-day-highlights-climate-action> accessed 7 August 2020.6Renee Cho, What can we learn from COVID-19 to help with Climate Change?

SUGGESTED STRATEGIES TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGH COVID-19ECONOMIC RECOVERY STIMULUS PACKAGES4.1. Focus COVID-19 Economic Recovery Stimulus Packages on Investment in Greener EconomyAccording to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), a green economy is one that results inimproved human well-being and social equity, while significantly reducing environmental risks and ecologicalscarcity. It is low-carbon, resource-conserving, and socially inclusive.3 Green economy potentially workstowards decreasing environmental pollution, and thus improves the quality of soil, water and air and alsoprotects environmental well-being.4 The green economy is geared to support sustainable consumption andproduction. It embraces new models of economic development that addresses the challenge of creatingprosperity and a better quality of life for all within the ecological limits of the planet.5 A Green Economy can bethought of as an alternative vision for growth and development; one that can generate growth and improvementsin people’s lives in ways consistent with sustainable development. It is an economy that promotes, sustains andadvances economic, environmental and social well-being.6 The green economy represents a radical new ambitionfor humanity: to ensure that our decision-making processes give full value to the environment and what it givesto us, so that we can continue to reap its benefits now and in the future.7As economies revive, an opportunity exists to develop public and private policies to tackle the currentclimate change crisis progressively and promote the transition to a green economy. The rebuilding of theeconomic framework should set the foundations for environmentally sustainable and socially inclusiveproduction and consumption as we progress into the future.8 According to Olivier De Schutter, the UN SpecialRapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, the economic turn down due to the COVID-19 pandemicunderlines the need to invest greatly in a greener economy. He noted that if we make the proper choices now, itwill be a chance to change our society into a more inclusive and equal one. Thus, as countries rebuild theirshattered economies, there is an opportunity to build back better and live in a more sustainable, “greener” way.9Governments worldwide are racing to implement economic recovery stimulus and support packages to keepindividuals, businesses, and economies afloat.

Alternatively, the FOLU report foundthat it is feasible to control climate change, protect nature, guarantee more healthy diets for everyone, enhancefood security, make stronger rural economies and unlock $4.5 trillion in innovative business opportunitiesannually by 2030 while simultaneously preventing $5.7 trillion annually in damage to people and our planet.7The innovations in green and global financial systems and the positive changes we have seen in business andworkplace practices, public policy, and consumer attitudes during this COVID-19 pandemic crisis have shownthat a sustainable post-COVID-19 recovery is not mission impossible.8During the 11th edition of the Petersberg Climate Dialogue Virtual Summit held on 27th to 28th April 2020,IMF Managing Director-Kristalina Georgieva, joined other policymakers and financiers like GermanChancellor-Angela Merkel, UN Secretary-General-Antonio Guterres and Achim Steiner-UN DevelopmentProgramme Administrator, in calling for focused efforts to encourage a "green recovery" from the COVID-19crisis. Georgieva asked governments to do everything in their power to promote a green recovery in response toCOVID19 by stating that its $1 trillion post-coronavirus stimulus package must tackle the climate crisis. TheIMF urged its 100 member governments who applied for financial assistance to invest emergency loans in greensectors and to scrap subsidies to fossil fuels and tax carbon. As it gears up to lend $1 trillion to governments hitby the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMF gives guidance on using the cash to tackle climate change.9By initiating the right policy environment, incentives for innovation, and infrastructure, governments canpersuade companies to take benefit of the opportunities of new technologies and value chains connected to greensectors. Simultaneously, governments can change current carbon-intensive economic and industrialstructures onto greener trajectories, allowing countries to meet international climate and development1Richard Florizone, Three Ways the Coronavirus is shaping Sustainable Development (International Institute for SustainableDevelopment (IISD), 31 March 2020) <https://www.iisd.org/articles/three-ways-cor onavirus-shaping-sustainable-development>accessed 30 July 2020.2Kamper, supra note 71; See Alex Kimani, $110 Trillion Renewables Stimulus Package Could Create 50 Million Jobs<https://finance.yahoo.com/news/110-trillion-renewables-stimulus-package-220000106.html> accessed 28 July 2020.3Bertrand Piccard and Frans Timmermans, ‘Which World do we want after COVID-19?’ Euractiv (Brussels: Belgium, 16 April 2020)<https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/opinion/which-worl d-do-we-want-after-covid-19/> accessed 31 July 2020; SeeMoustapha Kamal Gueye, Grasp the Silver Lining of the COVID-19 Pandemic (International Labour Organization Blog, 5 June 2020)<https://iloblog.org/2020/06/0 5/grasp-the-silver-lining-of-the-covid-19 -pandemic/> accessed 30 July 2020.4Aaron Bernstein, Coronavirus, Climate Change, and the Environment: A Conversation on COVID-19 with the Director of Harvard University'sCentre of Climate, Health and the Global Environment (Harvard T.H.

A 'greenrecovery' is our link to a more resilient future. Thus, governments must focus COVID-19 economic recoveryfiscal spending on promoting investments in greener technologies and climate resilience.24.2. Focus COVID-19 Economic Recovery Stimulus Packages on Transition from Fossil Fuels toRenewable EnergiesFossil fuels are hydrocarbons, primarily crude oil (petroleum), coal, and natural gas formed from decayed plantsand animals by exposure to heat and pressure in the earth's crust more than hundreds of millions of years. Theburning of fossil fuels by humans is the major source of emissions of carbon dioxide, which is one of thegreenhouse gases that contribute to global warming with the resultant effect of climate change.3 Renewableenergies, often referred to as clean energies are energies that comes from natural sources or processes that areconstantly replenished. Renewable energies are sustainable - something that cannot run out, or is endless, like thesun (solar energy) or wind (wind energy) and are alternative to the most commonly used non-sustainable sourcesof energy- like coal, petroleum etc. For example, sunlight or wind keep shining and blowing, even if theiravailability depends on time and weather.4According to the UNEP climate change expert-Niklas Hagelberg, without basic shifts in internationalenergy production; we should have no grounds to expect a long-lasting reduction in emissions. COVID-19provides us an opportunity to take stock of the risks we are taking in our unsustainable relationship with ourenvironment and snatch the chance to rebuild our economies in more environmentally responsible ways. Wemust consider global threats such as pandemics and climate change disasters to build resilient countries, globalsystems, companies, markets, and a healthy, sustainable future for everyone. Supporting COVID-19 economicrecovery fiscal stimulus, and finance packages to take advantage of decarbonisation and hastening renewable andclean energy transition will not be only a short-term economic win but a win for future resilience as well.5The magnitude of government spending to tackle COVID-19 needs to extend to an even deadlier crisiscolliding with this pandemic-the climate change crisis. The way forward is to decrease carbon intensive-energy,such as fossil fuels, and transit to renewable energy, which is now a competitive alternative.6 As Inger Andersen,the Executive Director of UNEP explains, renewable energy is now more cost-effective than ever, providing achance to prioritize clean economic recovery packages and get the world closer to meeting the ParisAgreement Goals. Renewable energy is a vital pillar of a healthy, safe, and green COVID-19 recovery thatleaves no one behind. If governments take benefit of the ever-falling price tag of renewable energy to place cleanenergy at the centre of COVID-19 economic recovery, rather than subsidizing the recovery of fossil-fuelindustries, they can take a huge step in the direction of clean energy and a healthy natural world, whicheventually is the greatest insurance policy against global pandemics.7The promotion of renewable energy can be a powerful engine for recovering the economy after the COVID-19 crisis, creating new and secure jobs. At the same time, renewable energy improves air quality, thus protecting1Assmann and Hastings, ibid.2Reuters Staff, IMF Leader says Pandemic Stimulus must focus on battling Climate Crisis, supra note 22; See The Editorial Board, ‘The Virus fightopens up a Climate Opportunity’ Financial Times (London, 15 May 2020) <htt ps://www.ft.com/content/eb683e52-95d0-11ea-abcd-371e24b679ed> accessed 7 August 2020; See Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director’s Opening Remarks at the Petersberg ClimateDialogue XI (International Monetary Fund, 29 April 2020) <https://www.i mf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/04/29/sp042920-m d-opening-remarks-at-petersberg-event> accessed 22 September 2020; See Mitch Anderson, Germany is Leading the World toward a Green Recovery:As Europe’s Biggest Economy Reboots, It - and many Others - are Planning to Transition away from Fossil Fuels (Reasons To Be Cheerful, 15May 2020) <https://reasonstobecheerful.world/c -lockdown-germany-green-economi c-recovery/> accessed 22 September 2020; HelenMountford, Responding to Coronavirus: Low-Carbon Investments can help Economies Recover (World Resource Institute, 12 March 2020)<https://www.wri.org/blog/2020/03/coronavirus-economy-low-carbon-inves tments> accessed 7 August 2020; António Guterres, Therecovery from the COVID-19 Crisis must lead to a different Economy (Unite Nations, 31 March 2020) <https://www.un.org/en/un-coronavirus-communications-te am/launch-report-socio-ec onomic-impacts-covid-19> accessed 8 August 2020.3Fossil Fuel <https://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/fossil_fuel.htm> accessed 11 September 2020; Otto C.
