There is now an acknowledgement internationally that fishers cannot depend on hunting fish when all other food producing sectors have adapted. How economic and feasible is it for fishers to consider aquaculture in the face of climate change? This dissertation investigates the economic viability of aquaculture as a climate change adaptation option in rural fisher communities of Zimbabwe. The southern lowveld district of Mwenezi was used as a case study in the economic evaluation of pond culture and cage culture as a climate change adaptation strategy from a baseline position. Data was obtained from secondary sources which include the private sector involved in aquaculture, civil society organisations and the fishers practising aquaculture in both Mwenezi and another district, Kariba.  The cost benefit analysis method of economic evaluation was used to assess the economic viability of pond and cage culture forms of aquaculture. The net present value, internal rate of return and benefit cost ratio were used as the decision criteria. Two scenarios were considered depending on the type of funding for the initial investment - scenario one was built on donor funding support while scenario two relied on a bank loan with interest for financing. A sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine the extent to which different factors affect the economic viability of both pond and cage culture.  Both pond and cage culture were found to be economically viable as climate change adaptation options in fisher communities of Zimbabwe. Cage culture was found to have a higher net present value under both scenarios when compared to pond culture. However, under scenario two, pond culture was found to have a higher internal rate of return and benefit cost ratio. The inconsistencies were due to the variations in the scale of upfront investments between pond and cage culture where the latter requires a higher initial investment. Key factors that affect the viability of aquaculture as an adaptation strategy in Zimbabwe include the market price of fish, the cost of fish feeds and the price of fingerlings. While these factors are primarily economic, there are other factors which may affect the viability such as the increasing frequency of natural disasters.  iv Table of Contents Plagiarism Declaration ........................................................................................................................................... ii Abstract.................................................................................................................................................................. iii Table of Contents ................................................................................................................................................. iv List of Figures ...................................................................................................................................................... vi List of Tables ........................................................................................................................................................ vi Glossary of Terms ............................................................................................................................................... vii Acknowledgements ............................................................................................................................................ viii 1.

Background to the study Climate change is a phenomenon that is rapidly adding to the expanding list of stressors that are challenging humanity’s ability to attain economic, social and ecological objectives which together define sustainability (Yohe et al., 2007). Moreover, it poses an ever-increasing danger particularly to communities which depend on natural resources for social and economic wellbeing. The impacts of climate change depend on the exposure level of the livelihood systems, the degree of sensitivity to the impacts, and the adaptive capacity of the groups involved (World Fish Centre, 2009), but are more severe in developing countries such as Zimbabwe, which are resource constrained.  Fishing communities, located along major rivers, man-made dams and lakes in Zimbabwe have a heightened sensitivity to climate change and a low adaptive capacity. Fishers living in these communities mostly practice artisanal fishing which is dependent on the productivity of the ecosystem. There is not much that fishers can do to immediately influence the productivity of rivers, dams and lakes which form the bedrock of their livelihoods. As a result, they are faced with declining catches, catches of only smaller fish which do not fetch good money on the markets and increasing costs of fishing, all of which are climate change induced (Brummet, Lazard & Moehl, 2008; Aquaculture Zimbabwe, 2015). Furthermore, Aquaculture Zimbabwe (AQZ), a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for the development of fisheries and aquaculture in low lying areas of the country, noted in 2015 that the fishers are not able to practice other typical livelihood activities such as cropping and livestock because the areas where they live are arid and infested with livestock diseases such as tsetse fly (Bourn, Grant, Shaw & Toor, 2005; Alsan, 2014). Unlike in other communities in Zimbabwe which can practice the tripartite livelihood activities of fishing, cropping and livestock rearing, the fishers only have one. Fishing, therefore, becomes a key livelihood strategy that supports many households and care needs to be taken to ensure the sustainability of the fishers’ way of life. The World Bank (2005) reported that the number of fishers has grown by 400% since 1950 and it was likely that more vulnerable and poor people were going to resort to fishing as the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture and other economic sectors worsen.  2 To counteract the impact of climate change on the livelihoods of poor and vulnerable rural people, mitigation and adaption measures are necessary. Across the world, many organisations and governments recognise the urgency of this need and have been implementing various steps to ensure that the adaptive capacity of resource-constrained poor communities is enhanced through various resilience building activities. In Zimbabwe, the government and some aid agencies have principally been focusing their attention on broad adaptation strategies that not only help communities to adapt but also to attain development to build resilient and sustainable livelihoods. However, more effort is needed in developing and implementing sector specific adaptation strategies, such as in the fisheries sector. 1.2. Problem statement For their household economic wellbeing, fishers are known to depend on fish, a natural resource whose distribution and productivity is influenced by climate dynamics (Allison et al., 2005). The impacts of climate change on fisheries in Africa was found to be linked to reduced productivity in lakes (O’Reilly, Alin, Plisnier, Cohen & McKee 2003). According to Allison, Andrew and Oliver (2007), climate change affects the productivity and distribution of fish resources through changes in growth rates and mortality rates. The changes experienced in fisheries can also be attributed to changing levels of rainfall and unpredictable rain patterns and increasing intensity of mid-season dry spells (Barange & Perry, 2009). Moreover, there is often localised extinction of certain species and emergence of others resulting in the need for investment in new fishing gear and the need to look for new markets (Aquaculture Zimbabwe, 2015). This is especially true in some areas such as Manyuchi in the Mwenezi district of southern Zimbabwe. Badjeck, Allison, Halls and Dulvy (2010) noted that fisheries the world over are also declining sharply due to overfishing. Furthermore, most fishing takes place in zones being threatened by pollution and the mismanagement of resources and habitats through poor resource governance systems (Badjeck et al., 2010). The fisher communities are thus faced with decreasing productivity of fisheries and the downward spiral in yields as well as their variability. The continued decrease and variability in yields directly results in reduced profitability for the fishers while also facing increasing costs to adapt to changes in the environment with dire consequences in meeting essential household costs such as health and education. As mentioned, developing nations, including Zimbabwe, appear to be highly vulnerable to climate change effects on fisheries as they have limited capacity to adapt and cope with these impacts (Agrawala & Fankhauser, 2008).  3 Over the years, fisher communities have been adapting to climate change in different ways, which include increasing fishing effort through investing in new technologies when productivity falls, diversifying livelihood portfolios in the face of increased variability of fish yields, exiting from fisheries or migrating when faced with reduced profitability among other activities International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD, 2014). However, for the poor and often marginalised communities, most of the adaptation options are out of reach due to limited access to resources.  Research on fisheries has focused principally on investigating the vulnerability and adaptive capacity of this sector, as well as the dependent communities, to climate change (Sadovy, 2005; McClanahan et al., 2008; Allison et al., 2009). As a result, the limited adaptive capacity and the rapidly increasing vulnerability of fishing communities are well-documented (Drinkwater, 2005; Lehodey et al., 2006; Brander, 2007). However, very little research has been done on the economic viability of specific adaptation options, with particular focus on fisher communities. Within the context of overexploited fishing grounds, resource constraints and high vulnerability, decision makers require meaningful information and the analysis thereof to guide investment initiatives to establish or strengthen climate change adaptation options so as to make the most of scarce resources (Allison et al., 2009). Kumar, Shyamasundar and Nambi (2010) proposed that an interrogation of various economic scenarios is vital when assessing the vulnerability of fisheries to climate change primarily because there is a close connection between adaptive capacity and the availability of financial resources. Against the backdrop of the dwindling supply of fish in lakes and dams, there is need for more information and analysis that can efficiently guide investments in climate change adaptation in the sector (Mullon, Freon & Cury, 2005; Newton, Cote, Pilling, Jennings & Dulvy, 2007). This research thus attempts to contribute towards information needs of development organisations and governments in the analysis and prioritisation of investments in adaptation options of fishing communities with specific attention on Zimbabwe where the livelihoods of fishers are threatened by the impacts of climate change.  What can possibly be the most realistic and economically viable climate change adaptation option in fisher communities? Instead of relying on hunting wild fish, is there no alternative for the fishers such that their catches can become more guaranteed and not open to the natural distribution of fish? Fish farming, or aquaculture, appears to be an immediate and easy answer. 4 However, one key question that has to be answered is: is aquaculture a viable climate change adaptation option in inland fishing communities? Therefore there is need to undertake an in-depth economic evaluation of aquaculture in Zimbabwe, assessing its economic viability when employed as an adaptation strategy among small-scale poor rural fishers. Zimbabwe is a landlocked country hence fisheries refer to inland activities with fishers plying their trade in rivers, dams and man-made lakes. Economic viability is taken to mean that aquaculture will be economically feasible and financially profitable such that fishers can supplement (diversify) or replace their dependence solely on fisheries (Lee & Yoo, 2014). This feasibility analysis is important particularly because there are not many agricultural activities which can be done in the low lying, arid and drought prone areas of Zimbabwe where most of the fishing communities are found. 1.3. Research objectives This research focuses on the economic evaluation of aquaculture as a climate change adaptation option in fishing communities of Zimbabwe to contribute towards the local adaptation literature, with a specific focus on the analysis of the costs and benefits of aquaculture in traditional fishing communities. The main objective of the research is thus to assess the economic viability of aquaculture as a climate change adaptation option in fishing communities of Zimbabwe.  The research objectives include the following: - Determine the economic viability of climate change adaptation option for fishercommunities in Zimbabwe when supported by donors (financial or training)- Determine the economic viability of climate change adaptation option for fishercommunities in Zimbabwe without donor support (financial or training)- Establish the more preferable aquaculture option for fisher communities in Zimbabwe- Identify the key factors that influence the economic viability of aquaculture inZimbabweThe key research questions to attain the main objective are: - Is aquaculture an economically viable climate change adaptation option for fishercommunities in Zimbabwe when supported by donors (financial and training)?5 - Is aquaculture an economically viable climate change adaptation option for fishercommunities in Zimbabwe without donor support (financial or training)?- Is pond or cage culture the more preferable aquaculture option for fisher communitiesin Zimbabwe?- What are the key factors that influence the economic viability of aquaculture inZimbabwe?1.4. Justification for the study With the help of decision makers, vulnerable communities need to implement accelerated adaptation measures to cope with the additional burdens arising from climate change. This is especially important in the context of the fisheries sector given the dependence of fishers on natural ecosystems with all its sensitivities to climate change variability (Osbahr, Twyman, Adger & Thomas, 2010). Despite aquaculture being a feasible and highly flexible source of fish in Africa (Brummet et al., 2008), inland fisheries are often left in the periphery of climate change adaptation prioritisation. Success in aquaculture can increase the amount of fish available for human consumption both at local and international levels. If well-linked to markets, it can create business opportunities beyond simply fish production but can also create employment, facilitate infrastructure development and ultimately contribute to economic growth (Brummet et al., 2008). Ovie and Belal (2010), as quoted in IFAD (2014), noted that small scale aquaculture, among other interventions, is already being used as a viable adaptive strategy to climate change impacts by fishers living around Lake Chad Basin where severe droughts are causing a reduction in the size of the lake.  Although aquaculture can work well as an alternative source of fish for the fishers, its adoption as an option for adapting to climate change has been limited across the world. Despite the fact that aquaculture itself, like all sources of livelihoods, must also adapt to climate change, its use for this purpose in fishing communities has been partially limited by the need for external investments mostly from aid agencies and local governments (Klein & Mohner, 2009). These institutions require information on the viability, efficiency and effectiveness of aquaculture interventions because investments in climate change adaptation compete with other priorities in the broader development finance discourse. Thus, the economic evaluation of adaptation 6 strategies can provide decision makers with important evidence for evaluating and exploring alternative uses of scarce resources, as well as when and how to make adaptation investments that are effective and efficient (World Bank, 2010). According to Heltberg, Siegel and Jorgensen (2009), there is a need to have realistic estimates of the costs and benefits involved in climate change adaptation strategies in order to inform and influence decision making at the policy level. To date no adaptation options in the fisheries communities in Zimbabwe have been subject to in-depth and rigorous economic evaluation to weigh these trades-offs.  Fishing communities no doubt form one of the most vulnerable groups within our society to climate change. Climate change is causing significant challenges to the productivity of fisheries and directly impacts on the resilience of the dependent livelihoods into the foreseeable future within an ever-increasing intensity. Livelihood resilience to the impacts of climate change is needed and it will take concerted efforts in committing time and resources to build meaningful adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity or strategies can take various forms ranging from processes to actions all with the intention of improving mechanisms for coping with the changing conditions within the environment (Smit & Wandel, 2006). This study will explore the possibility of building the adaptive capacity of fishers to the impacts of climate change on their livelihoods through engaging in aquaculture to reduce the variability of their yield and their income. Establishing whether such aquaculture will be economically viable is therefore of paramount importance.  The remainder of this study is laid out as follows: chapter 2 provides a review of the literature pertaining to the state of fisheries, impacts of climate change on fisheries and how aquaculture can be used as a climate change adaptation option in fisher communities. In chapter 3, the methodology followed in this study is outlined. The assumptions underpinning the analysis along with the results and analysis are presented in chapter 4. The conclusions and recommendations for future research are discussed in chapter 5.  7 2. Chapter two: Literature review2.1. Introduction This chapter reviews the trends in the smallholder fisheries subsector and how it has been affected by climate variability. It also focuses on the status of the Zimbabwean fisher communities and how they have been influenced by climate change. In addition, the chapter explores possible adaptation measures to counter the impacts of climate change including aquaculture and its economic benefits.  2.2. Fisheries and their importance in the economy Fisheries are a critical contributor to society – from both a humanitarian and an economic perspective. They provide a substantial quantity of food, with the supply of fish at a global level having grown at an average annual rate of 3.2% from 1961 to 2013 (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO], 2016a). As Figure 1 shows, the growth in the production of fish has been particularly pronounced in the past 25 years, with total fisheries production having increased from approximately 100 million tonnes in 1990 to more than 170 million tonnes in 2014. This food helps to reduce hunger and promotes health as fish is a nutrient-dense food; this is particularly important for poorer communities such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (Mohammed & Uraguchi, 2013). Figure 1 Capture fisheries and aquaculture production (Source: FAO, 2016a, p. 3) 8 In addition to the important contribution of fisheries to food security, they also create substantial employment and thus aid in supporting the livelihoods and income generation of millions (Barange & Perry, 2009; Shelton, 2014). According to the FAO (2016b), employment in the fisheries sector has grown faster than the world’s population in recent years. Mohammed and Uraguchi (2013) noted that up to 43.5 million people work in the fisheries sector, most of whom live in developing countries. For example, in Africa’s inland fisheries, over two million people are employed (de Graaf & Garabaldi, 2014). Barange and Perry (2009) estimated that the fisheries sector supports up to 200 million livelihoods when also accounting for men and women who work in backward and forward integrated industries supplying inputs and processing, marketing and distribution. Such levels of employment creation are possible because fish is one of the most traded and exported food commodities particularly in developing countries (Daw, Adger, Brown & Badjeck, 2009; Shelton, 2014). Further to this, the sale of fish from domestic fisheries internationally also contributes to economic growth through providing foreign currency which can possibly service international debt, pay for food imports and fund operations of national governments (Mohammed and Uraguchi, 2013). Global capture fisheries demonstrate variations in terms of scale, technology used, markets, and nature and type of fishers. However, despite this diversity, fisheries are usually classified as either marine fisheries, referring to large-scale ocean-based activities, or inland fisheries, which are generally small scale in rivers, reservoirs or lakes (Allison, Andrew & Oliver, 2007). Moreover, the term fisheries includes both traditional capture fisheries, usually simply referred to as just fisheries and aquaculture, which involves fish farming (Allison et al., 2007). As is evident in figure 1, global fish supplies from capture fisheries has stagnated since the 1980s while that from aquaculture has grown immensely in the past 25 years. In fact, by 2014, total capture fisheries’ contribution to global aquatic food for human consumption was only 55% compared to more than 80% in 1990 with aquaculture now contributing 45% compared to less than 20% (FAO, 2016a). Moreover, aquaculture is officially the world’s fastest growing agro food sector; having sustained an average growth of over 8.8% per annum in a little more than three decades (Toufique & Belton, 2014).  In developing countries, particularly those in SSA, most fisheries are inland (Mohammed & Uraguchi, 2013). Daw et al. (2009) noted that fisheries in developing countries are predominantly located in rural and remote areas, which are characterised by limited to non-availability of any other economic activities. In these rural and remote areas, inland fisheries 9 are dominated by fishers operating informally in a relatively disorganised system (WorldFish Centre, 2010b). However, the informal sector forms an important bedrock of most African economies, and thus represents a critical engine of growth (Daw et al., 2009). However, Daw et al. (2009) note that inland fishers are often marginalised and their contribution to food security and economic growth is often underestimated.  Like all other sectors, fisheries have been affected by climate change. Climate change “refers to any change in the climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity” (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2007, p. 871). Fishers who have access to limited geographical areas to fish and few livelihood alternatives are extremely vulnerable to climate change (Grafton, 2010). Daw et al. (2009, p. 118) noted that climate change will be “experienced as an increased frequency of extreme events” in fisheries. The unpredictability of the systems may possibly endanger the wellbeing of fisheries’ dependent communities. It is therefore important to understand how fisheries are currently being impacted and how they are adapting to the existing changes and variations in the climate and what other adaptation options can be pursued to sustain and grow fisheries so that they can continue to contribute both socially and economically.    2.3. Climate Change and Its Impact on Fisheries Although there is some disagreement regarding the status of fisheries across the globe, there is consensus on the fact that marine and inland aquatic species and habitats are at risk from both human pressures and climate changes. On one hand Shelton (2014) noted that there is rampant overexploitation of fishery resources and pollution as well as changes in fish habitats which are all human driven. In addition, IFAD (2014) also lamented the existence of discrimination in accessing resources and poor regulation in the sector as well as some of the decisions made by governing authorities which result in competition from other land water dependent sectors such as agriculture. On the other hand the speed and intensity of climate change is outpacing the ability of aquatic systems to adapt (IFAD, 2014). Climate change is therefore an additional burden to an already overstretched system, affecting both socio economic and ecological systems (Allison et al., 2007; Barange & Perry, 2009; Brander, 2007; Daw et al., 2009; Roy, 2012; Williams & Rota, 2010).  The impacts of climate change on fisheries are mainly driven by the on-going warming and related physical changes in the environment such as the accelerating frequency and intensity 10 of extreme weather events (Cochrane, De Young, Soto & Bahri, 2009). Such changes are taking place at a time when there are other numerous social and economic pressures on natural resources. The table below summarises some of these impacts of climate change on inland fisheries. Table 1: Impacts of climate change on inland fisheries Type of changes Climatic variable Impacts Potential outcomes for fisheries Fish stocks Higher water temperatures Altered timing of spawning, migrations and/or peak abundance Increased invasive species, diseases and algal blooms Changes in timing and levels of productivity across freshwater systems Ecosystems Reduced water flows and increased droughts Changes in lake water levels Changes in dry water flows in rivers Reduced lake and river productivity  Infrastructure and fishing operations Increased frequency of storms  Increased risk of accidents during fishing Damage to aquaculture installations (fish cages and ponds) Reduced viability of fishing and aquaculture as a livelihood option for the poor Inland fishing operations and livelihoods Changing levels of precipitation   Where rainfall decreases, reduced opportunities for farming, fishing and aquaculture as part of rural livelihood systems Increased risks to agriculture, greater reliance on non-farm income, reduced diversity of rural livelihoods   More droughts or floods Damage to productive assets (fish cages and ponds, weirs and homes) Increased vulnerability of riparian and floodplain households and communities Less predictable wet/dry seasons  Decreased ability to plan seasonal livelihood activities Adapted from Allison et al. (2009, p.177) 2.3.1. Fish stocks and ecosystems The impacts of climate change in SSA fisher communities varies across countries; however, one exception is the impact on the availability of fish which affects all countries, with stocks expected to fluctuate significantly from one season to the next (Brander, 2010). The impacts of climate change on fish stocks can be categorised as either physical or biological change where physical changes include temperature rise or changes in water salinity and acidity while biological changes include fish stock production and distribution (Mohammed & Uraguchi, 2013). Changes in factors such as water temperature can have significant ecological effects on water ecosystems within which the fish thrive (Barange & Perry, 2009; Brander, 2010). If the water temperatures rise above the maximum tolerable threshold of species, their physiological processes will be affected. For example, a temperature rise may result in alterations to the 11 traditional fish spawning times, increasing the outbreak of diseases and triggering algal blooms. As a result, fishers are likely to experience changes in timing and productivity of freshwater sources as well as increased variability in catches (Daw et al., 2009).  Badjeck et al. (2010) noted that the declining fish availability as well as variability in harvests already being experienced is mostly attributable to the changing climate at different societal levels. At the global level climate change impacts on the ecosystems will require fishers to adjust the measures necessary for capture fisheries to remain sustainable as it will affect fish habitats (Barange & Perry, 2009). The adjustments fishers need to take may include fishing practices and processing facilities.  2.3.2. Infrastructure and fishing operations Allison et al. (2007) noted that climate change can possibly damage physical infrastructure such as landing sites for fishers, fish processing centres and communication infrastructures linking fishers to the markets. Post-harvest handling infrastructure is particularly important for inland fisheries as they often act as rural economic centres. Disruptions to both operations and infrastructure will disconnect these rural economic centres with the outside economy thereby cutting them off from markets for both fish and inputs needed in fishing operations. Aquaculture installations such as fish ponds and cages may also be damaged hence they need to be constructed with the extreme events in mind. Ultimately there can be a reduction in the viability of capture fisheries and aquaculture as important livelihood sources for the poor in remote areas as a result of the effects of climate change on infrastructure and operations (Allison et al. 2005).  2.3.3. Inland fishing operations and livelihoods Livelihood diversification is a reliable mechanism to transfer risk and reduce the impact of shocks. Climate change reduces options for diversification and this will negatively affect livelihoods for fisher communities (Barange & Perry, 2009). In remote areas where options for adaptation are limited, fishers often integrate their fishing operations forward by seeking to engage with the markets and provide fish beyond the usual landing sites. However, extreme events may render such efforts difficult. 12 Where rainfall decreases, reduced opportunities for farming, fishing and aquaculture as part of rural livelihood systems may result in greater fisher household reliance on non-farm income. However, reduced livelihood options will push fishers to change occupations and increase social pressures. An example of this scenario is when water shortages, due to reduced precipitation, may create competition for water resources thereby affecting inland fisheries production which in turn creates resource-use conflicts among fishers and other societal groups. Inland fisheries can be significantly affected by droughts and floods (Allison, Perry, Renn, Brown & Poulain, 2013). Climate change also impacts negatively on household food and income security. For example, Southern Africa has been experiencing increased frequency of droughts which is leading to receding lake levels and river flows thereby affecting all livelihoods which have a fisheries component (Barange & Perry, 2009; Badjeck et al., 2010). Faced with this, fishers are likely to deploy varying coping strategies that include relocation to places deemed to have better fishing opportunities. Badjack et al. (2010) noted that such coping strategies are likely to result in resource access conflicts and challenges for authorities to establish vital government institutions such as schools and hospitals.  Climate change impacts men and women differently in the fisher communities. Most men are active in fish production (the actual artisanal fishing) while women take part in post-harvesting activities such as fish trading as well as salting and drying fish not sold (IFAD, 2014). De Graaf and Garabaldi (2014) estimated that of the women active in the fisheries sector in Africa, for example, 91.5% are working in post-harvest handling processes. Access to water for fishing is as important to men as access to markets is for women where they can profitably dispose fish. Disruptions to fishing activities driven by either droughts or floods therefore has particular gender implications as women would also be directly affected.  Fluctuations in fish stocks due to the less predictable seasons increases the vulnerability of fisher communities that heavily depend on fish for their livelihoods. Such dependence is often associated with vulnerability and lack of adaptive capacity because, as highlighted by Bene (2003), people may be poor because they are fishers surviving on poor returns from overexploited fisheries which is an open access resource with no barriers to entry. As a result, people generally engage in small-scale fishing, which is a livelihood of last resort, because they 13 are poor (Bene, 2003). This poverty among fishers is likely to be exacerbated by fluctuations in fish stocks caused by climate change. Shocks such as droughts and economic crises, which impact negatively on other economic sectors, often displace people through unemployment and push them into fisheries. Fishing, by its nature, is an easily accessible productive activity which can potentially offer immediate returns. Such displacements put immense pressure on fishing communities as they compete for fishing rights and access with new entrants.  2.4. Climate change adaptation and mitigation As part of dealing with climate change, mitigation and adaptation efforts are often undertaken. Mitigation mainly deals with reducing greenhouse gas emissions while adaptation entails devising mechanisms to cope with climate change at a local level (de Bruin, 2011). In the case of fisheries, adaptation is more important because the greenhouse gas contributions of fisheries and the related supply chain are small when compared to other sectors (Barange & Perry, 2009). Yet, fisheries are prone to the negative effects of adaptations in other sectors such as when irrigation systems are installed, dams for hydropower constructed and fertilisers and other chemicals are used (De Silva and Soto, 2009). While it is notable that poor resource-constrained communities that are dependent on fish have always adapted, projections of climate change and likely adaptation measures to be taken will have detrimental effects on the livelihoods of fishers leaving their traditional coping mechanisms largely inadequate (Adger et al., 2007; Daw, Adger, Brown & Badjeck, 2009).    The IPCC (2007, p.869) defines adaptation to climate change as “the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities”. Such adjustments take place through well thought out investments in initiatives that tackle potential damages of climate change while making the most of new or emerging opportunities (Adger et al., 2007). In essence, adaptation measures work by increasing the involved groups’ adaptive capacity while decreasing its sensitivity to climate change, in the process lowering the group’s vulnerability to the locally felt climate change impacts (Mastrandrea, Heller, Root & Schneider, 2010). Therefore, adaptation to climate change can involve both building adaptive capacity of the vulnerable populations aimed at increasing their ability to adapt to changes and also converting that 14 capacity into action. For example, in fisheries, adaptation to climate change may involve adjusting the frequency and scale of fishing to sustainable levels by changing the technology used (Shelton, 2014).  There are apparent vulnerabilities to climate change in both natural systems, such as wetlands and lakes, and human systems such as agriculture and settlements (McCarthy, Canziani, Leary, Dokken & White, 2001). Different forms of adaptation can be undertaken and Fankhauser, Smith and Tol (1999) distinguished between four different forms of adaptation namely: reactive, proactive/ anticipatory, autonomous, and planned adaptation. On one hand McCarthy et al. (2001) noted that adaptation in natural systems is reactive, when initial impacts have already manifested, while in human systems it is primarily anticipatory, that is, taking place before the apparent manifest of the impacts. On the other hand, autonomous adaptation is unplanned and therefore consists of spontaneous reaction to the changing environment while planned adaptation is deliberate and proactive in nature (Shelton, 2014; Watkiss, 2015). Of these, anticipatory adaptation has been identified as the best response mechanism to the changing climate for a number of reasons; key among them being its cost effectiveness when compared to the often unpredictable reactive adaptation. Shelton (2014) further went on to articulate a ‘no regrets’ approach to climate change adaptation which builds general resilience without substantial dependence on projections of specific climate change impacts. However, within these broad groups of adaptation measures, a challenge that decision makers often encounter is the identification of the optimum measures. It is only through well thought out assessments of adaptation options and mechanisms that decision makers are able to make evidence-based decisions about feasible measures to promote and adopt (de Bruin, 2011). A few studies have examined the costs of climate change adaptation in developing countries. The World Bank (2009), for example, estimated that by 2050, climate change adaptation would cost developing countries between $75 and $100 billion a year. Watkiss, Downing and Dyszynski (2010) derived the adaptation costs for Africa using an integrated assessment model and found that they would likely total between 1.5% and 3% of GDP annually. According to Adger (2006) most research on climate change focuses on its impacts, the vulnerability of people, livelihoods and entire communities to climate change and the adaptation constraints that they face. However, there is very little focus on weighing up the benefits and costs of the various adaptation options and initiatives that are available, especially in each country. This is confirmed by Adger, Agrawala and Mirza (2007) and Agrawala and Fankhauser (2008). This 15 shortage of research is particularly pronounced in the fisheries sector where aggregate assessments have been conducted but few practical assessments of adaptation options in specific countries have been undertaken. In fact, Adger et al. (2007), in an assessment of adaptation practices, options and constraints and capacity, found that many adaptations can be implemented at low cost benefiting resource constrained communities, but comprehensive estimates of adaptation costs and benefits are currently lacking. 2.5. Climate change adaptation options in fisheries Allison et al. (2007) documented that resource-dependent communities, particularly in the developing world, have adapted to climate variability throughout history. However, adaptation measures that were traditionally used are unlikely to be sufficient in the face of rapid effects of climate change as well as human-induced problems such as overfishing. Many fishers are being pushed beyond the limits of their experience in coping with the impacts of climate change (Coulthard, 2009). While Daw et al. (2009) noted that adaptation varies according to location and context, Coulthard (2009) emphasised that generally all adaptation in the fisheries sector either entails maintaining a fishery-based livelihood or exiting. Daw et al. (2009) further explained that in maintaining fishery based livelihoods, fishers can consider intensifying fisheries by increasing fishing effort, capacity and diversifying the targeted species. Nonetheless, Coulthard (2009) noted that in between sustaining and exiting from a fishery-based livelihood there is diversification of livelihoods. These three alternatives are considered below. 2.5.1. Maintaining a fishery-based livelihood Many fishers across the globe have various mechanisms to cope with lean fishing seasons which negatively affect their incomes. Shelton (2014) notes that some fishers in resource poor communities are proactively reducing destructive fishing practices such as fishing with poisons and explosives. Development agencies are also playing their part by helping communities enhance their adaptive capacities. IFAD (2014) documented that numerous adaptation options have been implemented successfully in fisheries throughout the world; among these is integrated aquaculture and agriculture systems. For example, Caritas Bangladesh is helping coastal communities that have traditionally relied on fishing to cope with climate change impacts by establishing fish ponds. The ponds are not only being used for aquaculture but are 16 used for irrigation and the dykes form part of vegetable gardens (Shelton, 2014). The project assisted the fishers by supplying fingerlings for mullet and tilapia fish species. Shelton (2014) also noted that Caritas Bangladesh’s project improved nutritional uptake and smoothed incomes and food availability for fishers who faced increased variability in their livelihood as a result of climate change.  Gurung et al. (2010) also gave an example in Nepal where farmers who were displaced in the construction of the Kulekhani reservoir, turned to cage culture in the dam. Although government policy makers had not included cage culture a part of their resettlement plans from the onset, the government ended up providing bighead and silver cap fingerlings for cage culture. As a result, up to 81% of the farmers displaced adopted cage culture. In communities surrounding Lake Malawi, various development agencies have helped the fishers deal with post-harvest losses by introducing fish smoking kilns (Jamu, 2011). In addition to reducing post-harvest losses, the smoking kilns also resulted in a huge reduction in deforestation which helped in improving water quality and therefore habitat for fish (Jamu, 2011). These developments were particularly important for the fishers whom Allison et al. (2007) described as heavily dependent on fisheries and fish trading. Another good example is that of Alaska in North America where the fishers’ livelihoods are increasingly under pressure from the negative impacts of climate change. The fishers are diversifying their livelihoods from traditional fishing activities to aquaculture with some very positive results being recorded (Johnson, 2012).  2.5.2. Livelihoods diversification  Livelihood diversification is a very important attribute for ensuring sustainability across the developing world, particularly in rural areas. Allison and Ellis (2001) noted that risk of livelihood collapse can be managed through diversity, spreading risk across a number of options. Agrawal and Perrin (2007) examined adaptation strategies in livelihood systems that are dependent on natural resources and noted that all of them involved pooling and sharing risks through mobility and diversification. Mobility also includes venturing into other sectors apart from fishing. Diversification is particularly important in fisheries because of the high levels of risk involved and seasonal fluctuations in catches (Shelton, 2014). It is related to the category of actions that fishers can take to sustain a fisheries-based livelihood. 17 2.5.3. Exiting fisheries Coulthard (2009) notes that exiting fisheries is a necessary and permanent long-term adaptation which can potentially lead to massive regeneration of fishery resources for future generations. It essentially entails finding alternative sources of livelihoods that are not linked to fisheries. UNDP (2011), as cited in Shelton (2014), noted that fishers in Mozambique’s coastal zone have been receiving finance options from a UNDP’s Global Environmental Programme to assist them in transitioning from fisheries to alternative livelihoods. The fishers received training in developing bankable business plans and forming associations as part of the support. Allison and Ellis (2001), however, cautioned that exiting fisheries may not yield any benefits as it may result in a mere substitution of one insecure livelihood with another and encouraged fishers to find alternative livelihood sources as they may potentially raise the opportunity income of fishing. A key recommendation from Allison and Ellis (2001) is that adaptation may be of benefit to fishers if they are assisted in finding their own pathways out of their circumstances through building on their capital and capabilities.  2.6. Aquaculture Aquaculture is defined by the FAO (2005) as the farming of aquatic organisms including fish. Farming involves protecting and feeding fish as well as creating conditions that enhance the growth rates of species. Fish farming has long been proposed as a means of enhancing food, nutrition and income security in the developing world, with a number of governments and international development agencies investing in its development (Toufique & Belton, 2014). Some of the factors that make aquaculture appealing are its high degree of elasticity and resilience with potential to be adaptable to different environments and investment levels from small to large commercial scales (Brummet et al., 2008). As early as 1998, Chikafumbwa, Katambalika and Brumet (1998) documented that in Malawi, aquaculture was being practiced in temporary water reservoirs to produce fish. In Lake Kariba, large commercial-scale aquaculture is being practiced by Lake Harvest which has markets in the region and Europe. Moreover, as highlighted in Section 2.1, aquaculture now contributes 45% to global aquatic food for human consumption and is the fastest growing agro food sector.  18 2.6.1. Economic benefits of aquaculture Empirical evidence shows that aquaculture has the potential to substantially improve the livelihoods of vulnerable and marginalised rural fisher communities (Husken & Holvet, 2010; Barman & Little, 2011; Pant, Shrestha & Bhujel., 2014). Pant, Shrestha and Bhujel (2014), in a study of a programme which promoted aquaculture among poor communities in Bangladesh, found that there was a significant increase in the incomes, savings and regular consumption of fish among beneficiary households. Roy (2012) noted that aquaculture plays an important role in supporting the livelihoods of many in India. Ahmed and Lorica (2002) highlighted the ability of aquaculture to improve productivity and increase incomes in traditional agricultural farms of Asian countries such as China, Indonesia and Thailand among others.   The benefits of aquaculture accrue not only to the fisher households (the ‘direct’ benefits) but also the community (the ‘indirect’ benefits). As shown in Figure 2, these indirect benefits arise through increased access to fish and lower priced fish in the market as well as through employment creation on the fish farms and the greater supply chain. It is thus evident that aquaculture is typically allied to a reduction in rural poverty and pro poor (Ahmed & Lorica, 2002; Toufique & Belton, 2014). Aquaculture is therefore not only promoting rural development through smallholder fish production systems but is also leading to economic development with commercial enterprises earning vital foreign currency and generating employment (Brummet & Williams, 2000). Brummet et al. (2008) felt that aquaculture can be applied to other African countries with similar benefits being realised although they felt that more people may benefit from small-scale aquaculture than commercial operations. However, Toufique & Belton (2014) also acknowledge that aquaculture alone may not be sufficient to meet future demand for fish and reduce. Rather, viable capture fisheries can effectively complement aquaculture activities.   19 Figure 2: Economic benefits of aquaculture Direct Consumption Indirect Increased consumption of fish from own fish production Increased availability of fish in markets Increased accessibility of fish due to reduced prices Increased incomes from entry into aquaculture or increased returns from existing production Employment on fish farms Employment in up and downstream value chains Consumption linkages in the rural non-farm economy  Income This figure summarises the economic benefits of aquaculture along two planes – direct versus indirect and income versus consumption. The benefits can accrue directly when community members benefit through fish production, household consumption and disposing of excess produce in the local market. The community may also benefit indirectly when they purchase locally produced fish at reasonable prices, obtain employment in the local fish value chain or earn income which they can use for other purposes.  (Source: Toufique & Belton, 2014, p. 611.) Aquaculture is often accused of wasting a lot of water thereby causing water resource access conflict among different user groups, particularly in the face of reduced precipitation. Admittedly, fish need water throughout the production process, however, when compared with other
