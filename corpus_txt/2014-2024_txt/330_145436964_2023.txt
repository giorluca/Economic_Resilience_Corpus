INTRODUCTIONMost of Indonesia’s economy is supported by SME’s that contribute to GDP, based ondata from the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises(KemenkopUKM) in March 2021, SME’s in Indonesia reached 64.2 million which con-tributed to GDP of 61.07% or equivalent to Rp8,573.89 trillion. In addition, SME’s areable to absorb 97% of the total existing workforce, and can collect up to 60.42% ofthe total investment in Indonesia. In2021, 64.5% of the total SME’s were managed bywomen. Then research from Sasakawa Peace Foundation & Dalberg also noted that thepercentage of women entrepreneurs in Indonesia is quite high, namely 21%. TheAsianDevelopment Bank’s survey of 2,509 SME’s nationwide shows that SME’s players whohave had to temporarily close due to the Covid-19 pandemic have been reduced. Inthe second quarter of 2021, only 1.8% of small business respondents stated that theywere temporarily closed due to the pandemic. This percentage is smaller than theMarch-April period in 2020 which reached 54.4%.Based on BPS data, foreign tourists (tourists) who came to travel to East NusaTenggara Province in 2021 were recorded as many as 8,745 people, down from theprevious years which recorded 44,778 visits in 2020 and as many as 112,806 visit in2019. The number of domestic tourist trips in 2020 decreased by 7.8 million or by 80percent, in 2019 there were 9.7 million trips and in 2020 it fell to 1.8 million trips. Theeffect of this decline has greatly impacted SME’s entrepreneurs related to tourism inNTT Province. The main obstacles for SME’s players in NTT are human resources andthe market to sell products. According to him, the best solution to the problem is bytransforming from conventional SME’s to digital SME’s.Survey BPS NTT during the Covid-19 pandemic shows that companies that have beendoing online searches before the pandemic have 1.22 times higher revenue comparedto those that were just online during the pandemic. In addition, there are about 4.2percent of start-ups in NTT that use the internet and IT for marketing. Therefore, theexistence of a digital network will make NTT products and tourist destinations not onlyknown domestically but also in the world. WEConnect International and World Bankmember International Finance Corporation (IFC) during 2020 found that 34% of womenentrepreneurs experienced increased anxiety that decreased productivity during thepandemic. In terms of time sharing, 27% of women entrepreneurs experience additionalresponsibility for children or parents which makes time for business matters reduced.Based on the above problems, researchers want to examine how the digitizationof SME’s and how women as economic actors have a major contribution in buildingDOI 10.18502/kss.v8i11.13571 Page 544ICoGPASSTable 1: Tourist Visit Data for West Manggarai Regency in 2018-2021.Information Foreign Tourists NusantaraTouristsLocal Travellers Total2021 3.028 59.192 - 62.2202020 18.350 26.072 83 44.5052019 168.814 85.898 1.897 256.6092018 91.870 69.343 1.841 163.054Source: BPS (Processed Data)the economy during the Covid-19 pandemic in West Manggarai Regency.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION4.1. Women's SME's in West Manggarai Regency During the Covid-19 PandemicSpecifically, East Nusa Tenggara Province has experienced a very significant impact dueto Covid-19. Economic growth of East Nusa Tenggara Province. It was recorded that theeconomic growth of East Nusa Tenggara province in 2020 cumulatively contracted by-0.83% (minus zero point eighty-three percent) year on year. The tourism sector, whichDOI 10.18502/kss.v8i11.13571 Page 546ICoGPASSis one of the sources of GDP for West Nusa Tenggara Province, has had a significantimpact due to Covid-19. Labuan Bajo, West Manggarai Regency, West Nusa TenggaProvince, which is one of the super national priority destinations, has experienced avery significant decline. Throughout 2021, tourist visits to Labuan Bajo only reached44,543 people, a decrease of 82% compared to tourist visits in 2019. Although therewas an increase of 62,220 tourists in 2021 or an increase of 140% from 2020, this hasnot been able to improve the performance of several sectors involved in the tourismecosystem in Labuan Bajo, including the hospitality and hospitality sector, travel agentsand the MSME sector.However, interestingly, even though SME’s are one of the sectors affected by Covid-19, a positive trend shows the growth of SME’s in West Manggarai Regency, East NusaTenggara Province (NTT). A total of 7,662 SME’s in West Manggarai grew during theCovid-19 pandemic. Of these, 2,572 of them have bagged a business registration markor business registration number (NIB). The rest do not have NIB, but have registeredthemselves as novice SME’s. Of the total SME’s in West Manggarai, the majority of themare engaged in the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries sectors. As many as 63 percentor 4,151 MSME players engaged in the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries sectors. Theremaining 23 percent or around 1,760 actors are engaged in the trade sector, and14 percent or about 1,100 business units are engaged in the processing sector, bothculinary and crafts.In an effort to increase digitalization of SME’s in West Manggarai, as many as25 women SME’s actors in Labuan Bajo, attended entrepreneurship training. Thisentrepreneurship training aims to support SME’s who face challenges in running theirbusiness by promoting the spirit of collaboration between sustainable business actors.In the training, the participants received training in product development, businessproblem solving, marketing, and business operations. One of the products of women’sSME’s in West Manggarai Regency is Perfect Fit Labuan Bajo which is a re-washingcloth pad that provides a frugal and smart choice for women when menstruating. Thisdressing consists of a fabric that is safe and comfortable for the female body. Thisproduct is made by a local tailor in West Manggarai Regency, East Nusa Tenggara, whois trained to produce quality re-sanitary napkins at affordable and comfortable prices.DOI 10.18502/kss.v8i11.13571 Page 547ICoGPASS4.2. Problems of Technology and Raw Materials for SME's in WestManggarai RegencyResearch conducted by Riskin Hidayat and Siti Alliyah (2021) found that information tech-nology is able to mediate the influence of gender on the performance of Coffee SME’sboth in conditions before the Covid-19 pandemic and during the Covid-19 pandemic.This means that the role of information technology adopted by coffee MSME managersis very important in improving their business performance. Meanwhile, research con-ducted by Satria Tirtayasa, Ira Nadra, andHazmanan Khair (2021) said that entrepreneursmust start changing the style of buying and selling transactions and concentrate onmarketing in digital marketing through websites, e-commerce, social media, searchengines, selling through marketplaces, to form reseller teams to sell their goods, untilproduction remains alive in the midst of this pandemic. Business actors also need totake advantage of this period to improve their skills for future business development.Based on data from BPS in 2020, at least 27.11 percent or about one in four residentsin West Manggarai accessed the internet in the last three months. This states that theinequality of internet access inWest Manggarai is still very high, with the current situationwill make it difficult for MSME actors to promote or sell products online. Therefore,technology is very important during the Covid-19 pandemic. People’s behavior haschanged due to large-scale social restrictions (PSBB), so that people use technology intheir daily activities, from work to buying their needs. Many SME’s in West ManggaraiRegency have entered themarketplace, it’s just not very helpful because buyers outsidethe island of NTT have to pay very high shipping costs so that many may be reluctantto buy.Satria Tirtayasa, Ira Nadra, and Hazmanan Khair (2021) stated that entrepreneursmust start changing the style of buying and selling transactions and concentrate onmarketing in digital marketing through websites, e-commerce, social media, searchengines, selling through marketplaces, to form a reseller team to sell the goods, untilthe production remains alive in the midst of a pandemic. Business actors also need totake advantage of this period to improve their skills for future business development.For example, expertise in doing digital marketing or developing your own e-commerceplatform. So that when the business runs normally, business operations can run fasterthan before. Karnida Retta Ginting, Galuh Pancawati, Budi Priyono (2022) First, aboutaccess, we can conclude that the development based on considerations provides equalaccess for women and men, and each group: Indigenous Papuan women is doing good.DOI 10.18502/kss.v8i11.13571 Page 548ICoGPASSThe part of participation, indigenous Papuan women involved in theestablishment ofthe market.Not only technological problems, the rawmaterials used to produce are also obtainedfrom outside the island of NTT. From the results of a survey conducted by the WestManggarai Cooperatives, SME’s, Manpower, and Transmigration Office, SME’s still sendraw materials such as woven fabrics to Java, then receive them back in the form ofaccessories. In fact, local SME’s should be able to process the weaving derivativeproducts themselves. Although there are several SME’s that have tried this, the productquality is not very good.The impact of purchasing raw materials from Java island results in high shippingcosts so that it will affect production costs and high selling prices. Rendi Heryandi, EviMartaseli and Ade Sudarma (2022) stated that the cost of raw materials has a partialand significant influence on profits, as well as the variable selling price has a partialand significant influence on profits in the home industry, and the overall variables ofraw material costs and selling prices simultaneously or together have an influence onprofits. In fact, if the raw materials needed can be easily obtained around the businesslocation, it will reduce production costs.4.3. The Role of Women SME's in Efforts to Recover the EconomyAfter the Covid-19 Pandemic in West Manggarai RegencySME’s and women are indeed inseparable, based on data from the Ministry of Coopera-tives and Small and Medium Enterprises (Kemenkop UKM) in 2021 at the micro businesslevel, 52 percent of the 63.9 million micro business actors in Indonesia are women. Forthe small business level, there are 56 percent of the 193 thousand small businessesthat own it as women. Meanwhile, for medium-sized businesses, 34 percent of the 44.7thousand business actors are women. In addition, MHM has a large contribution to theIndonesian economy. SME’s account for 60 percent of the total national economy and97 percent in terms of job creation and absorption. SME’s are not only activities carriedout by many actors, especially women, but they are also the drivers and backbone ofthe economy in the future.Marthalina (2018) stated that women’s empowerment in supporting SME’s in Indonesiahas enormous potential and must be optimized by the central and local governments.Cooperation from various private parties, banks and other institutions is needed tosupport women’s empowerment. Nur Fitri Mutmainah (2020) stated that the obstaclesto economic business development are influenced by the dual role where the burden ofDOI 10.18502/kss.v8i11.13571 Page 549ICoGPASShousewife workers in the domestic sector and the support from families is lacking; self-development and support from local governments are still very minimal. Karnida RettaGinting and Galuh Pancawati (2020) Implementation of the PEN policy has a goodimpact on economic recovery after the pandemic. To revive the national economy afterexperiencing a recession, it is important to revive SMEs because SMEs play a directrole in the people’s economy.As a multi-ethnic and super premium destination, in its development, Labuan Bajorequires culinary activists and wiira kriya, who are not only creative but tough and ableto make it an identity destination. Therefore, in an effort to increase capacity for femaleMSME actors in West Manggarai Regency through the collaboration program of PTASDP Ferri Indonesia (Persero) and the Labuan Bajo Unitas Business Group Association(Accountability), 30 innovators of Culinary and Songke Crafts SMEs were selected toattend training or bootcamp on June 21-26, 2021. They are SME innovators who havebeen moving and continuing to help improve the regional economy in the midst of theCOVID-19 pandemic storm.The creativity and resilience of SME innovators who have been trained are expectedto increase their capacity through business knowledge, build marketing networks,strengthen capacity to the quality of premium products that are certainly ready tocompete in the local and global markets. As an important note during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is precisely SME’s that are able to survive. Even the number of MSMEactors in Manggarai Barai Regency has increased a lot, independence in trying toactually grow and rise during the Covid-19 pandemic. By conducting various trainings,SME’s are expected to become stronger in building businesses in the future, especiallyfacing the COVID-19 pandemic.Evidence that women SME’s in West Manggarai Regency are able to support theeconomy during the cocid-19 pandemic, namely seven SME’s fromMabar Accountabilitywho participated in the MSME exhibition at the Mandalika MotoGP held on March 18-20, 2022, namely Michael Wyang’s Cuing Bajo, Komodo Gift Shop (Kandy Mayangsari),Labajo Coffee (Cristine Mayasari), New Eden (Lieta), Kompiang Bajo (Nita), SibakloangCoffee (Isye Fernandez), and Bajo Bloom (Ana Fletcher) where the majority of MSMEowners are women.5. COVERAlthough the development of SME’s is very rapid, in reality SME’s still send raw materialssuch as woven fabrics to Java, and then receive them back in the form of accessories. InDOI 10.18502/kss.v8i11.13571 Page 550ICoGPASSfact, local SME’s should be able to process the weaving derivative products themselves.In addition, in an effort to improve the quality of SME’s in West Manggarai Regency. TheWest Manggarai Regency Government conducted Digital Entrepreneurship Academy(DEA) training for SME’s players to be able to take advantage of digital technology andenter the digital business. TheWest Manggarai Regency Government must focus on theavailability of raw materials for SME’s actors. One of them is appointing special suppliersof rawmaterial providers for SME’s players so that they can cut production costs throughreducing the cost of purchasing raw materials and it is necessary to collaborate withvarious parties who can receive SME’s products from West Manggarai Regency so thatconsumers can buy products without being burdened by such high shipping costs.References[1] Rahardjo A.
