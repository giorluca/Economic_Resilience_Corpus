This study also intended to understand the extent to which SES moderated the relationship between resilience and parental daily stresses. A total of 102 parents of children with ASD completed three measures (Family Resilience Assessment Scale, Parental Daily Hassles Scale and Hollingshead Two Factor Index). Pearson‟s correlation revealed significant moderate correlations between parental daily hassles (frequency and intensity scales), Family Resilience Assessment Scale, and SES. A regression analysis illustrated that the parent‟s gender was a significant contributor in the daily hassles of parents (Frequency and Intensity). A t-test analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between fathers and mothers in favour of the latter on Parental Daily Hassles Frequency and Intensity. A stepwise regression illustrated that SES moderated the relationship between Resilience and Parental Hassles (Intensity). The family‟s SES levels had a significant impact in the resilience levels of the parents such that lower SES parents were faced with more micro level challenges that impacted in their parenting.  Key words:  Autism Spectrum Disorder, Parental Daily Hassles (frequency and Intensity), Family Resilience, Socio-Economic Status        iii     Acknowledgements Thank you to my supervisors Ms. Renate Gericke and Prof Joseph Seabi for their patience and support in writing this dissertation.

INTRODUCTION 1.1.Statement of the Problem  Raising a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a physically, emotionally and financially costly experience (Bitsika, Sharpley & Bell 2013; Markoulakis, Fletcher & Bryden 2012; Lee et al.,  2009).  Other challenges associated with having a child with ASD include high therapy and education costs. Some parents are unable to deal with these challenges. Many parents respond with shock when faced with the reality of their child‟s diagnosis of autism (Heiman, 2002). After a diagnosis is obtained, parents and sometimes other members of the family may show elevated stress levels (Bitsika et al., 2013; Rolland & Walsh, 2006; Siman-Tov & Kaniel, 2011). In some families, this experience may affect the quality of life to the extent that the family‟s functioning deteriorates. Greeff and Van der Walt (2010) mentioned that the presence of a child with ASD may have adverse effects on various domains of family life, including the marital relationship, sibling relationships and adjustments as well as normal family routines. Family daily routines are often determined by the needs of the child and are changed accordingly in order to accommodate the daily demands of the child (Greef & van der Walt, 2010). Children with ASD often require twenty-four hour care and some parents are unable to provide this (De Grace, 2004). Many families often need help when undergoing changes such as dealing with the presence of a child with ASD. In the aftermath of a major family transition such as having a child with ASD, families usually find it difficult to return to the previous level of functioning (Walsh, 2003).  Limited studies have explored the interaction of resilience and socio-economic status combined, relation to particularly in parent‟s experience of daily hassles in raising children with ASD. Daily hassles are related to child behaviours and parenting daily duties that are challenging to parents. While Greef and Van der Walt (2010) investigated resilience in the parenting of children with ASD, the findings of the study were confined to middle class contexts. This study explored beyond middle class families, as it included all levels of SES families with ASD children.  2    Parents of children with ASD from disadvantaged families often battle to find diagnosis early for their children and some children from disadvantaged backgrounds are kept away from the public because of a lack of understanding of the disorder (Newschaffer et al., 2007). This problem is directly linked to finances and a lack of necessary information about the child‟s condition (Mandel et al., 2007). Circumstances have limited these families from finding a diagnosis as well as proper care for their children (Dawson, 2011).  Research has found that high resilient families who are raising children with ASD coped with challenges associated with the child‟s disorder and generally adapted better when compared to families of typical children (Simon, Murphy, & Smith, 2005). It is against this backdrop that this study was undertaken in order to understand the role of resilience in the parenting of children with ASD in different SES families in South Africa. This study proposed that the family‟s SES would moderate the relationship between resilience and parental daily hassles, such that a change in SES will moderate the relationship between resilience and parenting daily hassles.  1.2.Rationale   Siblings and families of children with ASD experience more than the usual care giving demands. The demands are diverse, some parents have reported experiencing unpleasant attitudes from practitioners and school educators in reaction to the child (Gerstein, Crnic, Blacher, & Baker, 2009). A number of studies have suggested that resilience could be a buffer in the parenting of children with ASD (Greef & Van der Walt, 2010; Lee et al., 2009; Twoy, Connolly & Novak, 2007).  While there is no consensus on the causes of ASD, different researchers have provided different causal models. Some of these models include genetic factors, auto immune factors and vitamin D deficiencies (Bakare & Munir, 2011). There is limited knowledge around ASD among the general populace and various categories of health workers and these are some of the challenges that parents are unable to cope with (Bakare & Munir, 2011).    3   Research suggests that having resilience during challenging periods as a process of bouncing back could be a useful factor and may assist families and parents who are in crisis to return to a pre-existing norm (Walsh, 2003). Walsh defines resilience as the ability to withstand and rebound from disruptive life challenges. It has been found that the entire family contributes to resilience in their unique and individual personal qualities (Simon et al., 2005).  Resilient families are able to deal with life challenges if they show strong focus in communication, finances and strong family ties (Simon et al., 2005). According to Heiman (2002), parents of children with special needs such as ASD were able to act in a resilient way by drawing support from family members, professionals and friends.  Studies have shown that family bonds promote family resilience during periods of adversity (Greef, Vansteenwegen & Gillard, 2012). A balance between demands faced by a family and courage in dealing with challenges has been found to mean success in adaptation (Greef et al., 2012). Families who have a supportive environment and a higher degree of cohesion are more likely to adapt to the presence of an autistic child (Greef & van der Walt, 2010). Thus, family resilience is the path a family undertakes as it adjusts and prospers in the face of adversities (Hawley & De Haan, 1996). Family resilience therefore looks far beyond parent-child relationships; it also involves the influence of extended family networks, siblings and social relations (Walsh, 2003). The premise of the family resilience perspective is that serious crisis and challenges have an adverse impact on the family as a whole (Walsh, 2003). Each member of the family plays a role in contributing to family resilience. Parents contribute through their personality traits and their coping mechanisms and children may contribute through their cognitive and emotional development (Simon et al., 2005). Mothers of children with ASD have been found to experience more than normal levels of depression and anxiety in parenting, as compared to fathers (Bitsika et al., 2013). An additional factor explained in Walsh (2003) was the family‟s financial security. This factor if disregarded could have damaging effects in the family since a serious illness or chronic disorder such as ASD can strain the family‟s finances.    The family‟s SES background has a fundamental role in the care giving process. Previous studies have suggested that the parent‟s education levels and family income are a determinant of SES 4   and have a positive relationship with the family‟s success in adaptation and the development of a child with ASD or general disabilities (Greef et al., 2012). The American Psychology Association conceptualised SES as the individual‟s or group‟s social/class standing which is often measured as a combination of occupation, education and income (APA, 2014). SES has been shown to associate with children‟s well-being and development. Low parental education has been found to correlate with lower levels of IQ and school achievement later in childhood.   The poor cannot afford to seek care when ill and the distribution of health is in favour of the rich. The costs associated with raising a child with ASD are exorbitant. The lifetime costs of caring for a child with ASD ranges from 1.4 to 3.5 million dollars (Lord & Bishop, 2010). The average public health expenditure of a child with ASD is 85% to 550% higher than that of a typical child, and is estimated at 4.7 million dollars (Newschaffer et al., 2007). The cost of raising a child with ASD in South Africa is approximately 3 million rands, and if interventions are received earlier such costs could be reduced to 1 million rands (Brink, 2012). The average monthly income of a South African is estimated at 5 802 rands per month (Stats SA, 2014) and the monthly fees for privately owned schools which cater for ASD children range from approximately 6 000 rands per month. These schools are only available in large cities. Accessing better education is difficult and expensive for parents in the lower SES stratum. This particular study explored the role that resilience and SES play in the parenting of children with ASD. South African studies on resilience have largely focused on the middle to higher SES groups. Thus there is a need to understand resilience in the low SES context and to explore whether parenting of children with ASD in these groups is indeed affected by SES status.  It is essential to acknowledge that this study does not purport that caring for a child with ASD is a negative experience for parents and families. The essential focus of this study was to understand how these families overcome the daily parenting challenges and to further understand the role resilience and SES has in these families.    5    1.3.Research Questions  The following research questions were a guide for this research study 1.1.1. Is there a difference between parental daily hassles (Frequency and Intensity) of female participants and male participants?  1.1.2. Is there a relationship between parental daily hassles (Frequency and Intensity), resilience and SES? 1.1.3. What is the best predictor of parental daily hassles (Frequency and Intensity) between the patents‟ SES and Resilience levels? 1.1.4. What moderation effect does SES have on the relationship between resilience and parental daily hassles (Frequency and Intensity)?  1.4.Aims of the study  The aim of this study was to explore the role of resilience and SES in the parenting of children with ASD among South African parents. The study also explored the extent to which SES of the parent moderated the relationship between resilience and parenting daily hassles for parents with children diagnosed with ASD in South Africa.   1.5.Overview of the Research Study  This research study comprises five chapters. Chapter two reviews the literature, chapter three discusses the method applied in this research study. The analysis and the results are presented in chapter four. Finally chapter five provides the discussion section, the limitations, implication of the study and conclusion.   6   CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW  2.1 Introduction  This chapter provides a review of literature on the topic of daily stresses experienced by parents of children with ASD. The literature further focuses on the role of resilience and SES in parenting children with ASD. Given that there are limited studies conducted in South Africa and in the African continent on the topic of ASD, the literature is largely drawn from studies conducted beyond the African continent.  2.2 Autism in South Africa  ASD is a relatively new disorder in South Africa. The first diagnosis of autism in South Africa was in 1970, before this diagnosis children with ASD were regarded as mentally retarded (Venter, Opt-Hof, Coetzee, Walt & Rietief, 1984). The first diagnosis in South Africa was obtained 27 years after the initial discovery of the disorder by Kanner in 1943. Not much research in the area of ASD has been done in South Africa thus there are still many challenges that the country is undergoing in dealing with ASD. Challenges such as the  scarcity of professionals who are qualified to diagnose the disorder, schooling for children with ASD and the general knowledge of the disorder in the general populace are the commonly mentioned challenges in previous research studies (Pillay & Lockart, 2001; Roberts, 2007; Dabrowska & Pisula, 2010). According to Mubaiwa (2008) the prevalence of ASD in South Africa mirrors that of Europe and America of 10-20 per 10 000.   The issue of proper education for children with autism is yet to be addressed in the country. The majority of children with ASD attend  segregated schools and  there is currently no transition plan for integration into mainstream schools (Molteno, Molteno, Finchilescu & Dawes, 2001). A study by Ysell et al. (2007) on parents‟ perceptions in South Africa and United States reported a 7   desire from parents for the inclusion of children with disabilities in mainstream schools as a necessity for their children.  Roberts (2007) stated that the education authorities in South Africa do not fully support the idea of integrating children with ASD into mainstream schools. The study further highlighted that mainstream teachers have limited knowledge in teaching children with ASD (Roberts, 2007). Challenges of this nature have created difficulty in rolling out programmes of including children with ASD in mainstream schools. The shortage of teachers specialising in ASD in government schools poses a challenge to parents who are unable to send their children to alternative schools. Schools which cater for ASD children in South Africa may not be accessible to all parents due to affordability and accessibility. These constraints disfavour ASD children from disadvantaged backgrounds as some children may end up starting school late and some may even be institutionalised (Holroyd, Brown, Wikler & Simon, 1975).  2.3 Definition  The term „autism‟ is taken from a Greek term „autos‟ meaning „self‟. Children with ASD experience difficulties in social and communication interactions, as a result most of them tend to keep to themselves. ASD has been found to occur more in boys than in girls, with a ratio of 4:1 males to females (Faras, Al Ateeqi & Tidmarsh, 2010). The prevalence of the disorder has increased significantly over the past decade. This increase could be associated with better diagnostic tools and public awareness (Faras et al., 2010). The criterion used for diagnosing ASD has also changed over the years.  The first Diagnostics and Statistical Manual (DSM I and II) did not have a term or a disorder called autism. The closest term to the diagnosis of autism at the time of the DSM I was Schizophrenic Reaction Childhood (McPartland, Reichow & Vokmar, 2012). Further research produced new knowledge in the early 1980‟s thus the DSM III introduced Pervasive Developmental Disorders with three categories, which were Childhood Onset PDD, Infantile Autism and Atypical Autism (McPartland et al., 2012).  8   The diagnostic criteria for autism have continued to advance. The introduction of the DSM 5 in (2013) brought about major changes. A fundamental change is the combining of all diagnosis found in the DSM IV TR into a single diagnosis, ASD (Frazier et al., 2012). The criterion for diagnosis in the DSM 5 was tested in real clinical settings to ensure a more accurate approach in the diagnosis of ASD (McPartland et al., 2012). The DSM 5 proposes the following for the diagnosis of ASD, impairment in social interaction and communication, repetitive mannerisms, behaviour and activities.   The symptoms should be present from early development and should cause clinically significant impairment in social functioning. The disorder should not be the result of intellectual disability though it is common that autism and intellectual disability co-occur (MacPartland et al., 2012). The DSM 5 has introduced three severity levels of ASD.   In level one, individuals require support because of their deficit in social communication which in turn causes noticeable difficulties when switching between activities. Level two individuals are regarded as individuals who „require substantial support‟. Individuals in level three require even greater support as these individuals do not only have difficulty in social function they are also very limited in initiating social interactions. Research in the field of ASD over the years has produced improved knowledge in the subject of ASD.  The introduction of the DSM 5 will reduce the numbers of people who receive ASD diagnosis significantly compared to the DSM IV. Different studies have found that people who received diagnoses using DSM IV TR declined by up to 55% (Worley & Matson, 2012; MacPartland et al., 2012). It is hoped that the introduction of the DSM 5 will bring about more accuracy in diagnosing ASD as it provides clearer diagnosis criterion (MacPartland et al., 2012). This suggests that ASD is still a relatively new disorder and more studies are being conducted to improve the diagnosis as well as the body of knowledge that exists.    9    2.3.1 Communication Impairment  It is mentioned that some children with ASD are non-verbal and if speech is present they suffer from „theory of mind‟. Theory of mind is defined as the inability to process information such as central coherence and executive functioning which can be classified as cognitive problems (Leyfer et al., 2006). It further states that individuals with ASD fail to attribute mental state of themselves and of others. Wimmer and Perner (1983) developed the unexpected test of false which tests the mental state and examines the child‟s understanding of true, mistaken and false belief (Sprung, 2003). About 80% of children with ASD failed the unexpected test of false. The unexpected test of false assumes that children acquire developmental ability of understanding reality by the age of four. For example, children who failed this test were unable to follow a sequence of events when tested. The assessment is conducted by using two dolls, and one doll has an incongruous belief of the other doll‟s location. The child is then asked to predict the other doll‟s location, and most ASD children fail to correctly predict the location.  ASD individuals who suffer from these cognitive problems may be unable to define their mental state and unable to experience daily life experiences (Leyfer et al., 2006). One of the triad of ASD is communication or linguistic disorders. Some common language deficits in children with ASD are the idiosyncratic use of language, use of unusual or made up words (neologism), imitation of words that are not appropriate to current production (echolalia), reversal of second person nouns, inappropriate intonation and poor syntax (Adams, Gouvousis, Van Lue & Waldron, 2004). Some researchers have compared language disorders in children with ASD with that of children with developmental delays (Loveland & Landry, 1986; Lovaas, 1977). The language of an ASD child is more severe when compared to that of a delayed child. Further to this, ASD children from an early age fail to develop early communicative gestures such as pointing at an object and this challenge has been identified as one of the core issues which pose problems in their future speech language development (Adams et al., 2004). Language deficits in children with ASD create a further challenge in their reciprocal conversations and subsequently leading to other related problems such as social skills (Adams et al., 2004).  10   2.3.2 Social Impairment  Poor language, lack of eye contact, and misunderstanding of social cues like body language, gestures and facial expression may lead children with ASD to experience difficulties in interacting socially with others. These reasons mentioned may cause ASD children to withdraw from others, become aggressive and sometimes behave inappropriately (Adams et al., 2004). Lack of social skills impact on the global development of the child, for example poor social skills deprives the child with the benefits of positive support and opportunities found in healthy peer relationships (Disalvo & Oswald, 2002). Furthermore, poor social skills have been found to increase the likelihood for children with ASD to develop maladaptive behaviours later in their lives (Disalvo & Oswald, 2002).   The study further mentioned that ASD children do not experience complete failure but lack the flexibility and the spontaneity of applying social reciprocity (Disalvo & Oswald, 2002). It is also mentioned that the main problem is the actual acquiring of these skills, even when they desired to interact with others; their skills are usually not adequate for them to interact (Disalvo & Oswald, 2002). Previous research has suggested that children with ASD may be taught these social skills through applied behavioural principles. These studies mentioned that through adult modelling and peer teaching, children could be taught to orient to another person, make eye contact, and vocalise a response towards that individual (Disalvo & Oswald, 2002; Mc Eachin, Smith & Lovaas, 1993). The weakness of these interventions is that, when modelled by adults the natural context of children‟s social interactions is usually ignored. Peer modelling also has some shortcomings which includes the premature and actual absence of relevant modelling skills required in order to be able to transfer these skills (Disalvo & Oswald, 2002).  2.4 Aetiology of Autism Disorder  Since the discovery of the disorder by Kanner in 1943 the causes of ASD are still not  adequately defined. Kanner (1943) suggested that the disorder is caused by an unknown inborn defect. Kanner suggested that parents of ASD children came from highly intelligent backgrounds, there 11   were patterns of obsessiveness in the family, most parents were professionals and finally he stated that most of these parents had limited genuine concern in people. In his discovery he stated that there were few warm hearted mothers and fathers. While some researchers (Bettelheim, 1967) agreed with Kanner‟s findings other studies discovered biological and prenatal causes of the disorder (Folstein & Piven, 1991). There are a few anecdotal risk factors that have been listed as possible causes of the disorder by the United Kingdom Research Council (UKRC). These include exposures before and/or after birth to drugs, vaccines, infections, heavy metal, epilepsy, mental deficiencies, depression, anxiety and gastrointestinal tract. One of the listed risk factors, Measles Mumps and Rubella (MMR) occupied many research journals after a paper released by Dr Andrew Wakefield in 1998. Incident cases of autism after the introduction of MMR vaccine increased after Dr Wakefield‟s paper in 1998, this suggested that receiving an MMR vaccine was associated with the development of autism (UKRC, 2001). However, MMR as a cause for ASD has been disproved in many recent studies which found no evidence that MMR caused ASD, and the paper by Wakefield was retracted (Maglione et al., 2014; Baird et al., 2008)    An association of high mercury (Hg) exposure and ASD has also been reported. A study by Bradstreet, Geier, Kartzinel, Adams and Geier (2003) found that 221 children with ASD had high urinary mercury concentration when compared to a control group of 18 typical children. This study also found that vaccinated children with ASD showed higher urinary mercury concentration compared to the normal group (Bradstreet et al., 2003). This study however failed to determine whether these high levels in mercury (Hg) are due to higher exposure to (Hg) or failure to excrete mercury in the system or a combination of the two reasons (Bradstreet et al., 2003).  The increase of industrial areas may be one of the causes of the high levels of Hg in the air and water. It is mentioned that Hg is released into the air and water from natural resources such as coal burning and manufacturing facilities. It is thus spread in the air and in the entire environment, through the food chain and is then consumed by humans through absorption in animal tissues such as fish (Geier, Kern & Geier, 2010). There are different other processes which may increase the exposure of Hg in humans. Some drugs which are easily accessible over 12   the counter for example, certain skin bleaching creams, some contraceptives, other lens solutions and some dental fillings contain inorganic forms of Hg (Geier et al., 2010). About 6% of women of child rearing age were found with high concentration levels of Hg in their system (Geier et al., 2010). The foetus is known to be susceptible to high levels of Hg which may disrupt the neurodevelopmental process and renal impairment from the foetus thus leading to the development of ASD (Geier et al., 2010).   Different studies have mentioned an association between heredity and ASD. Jick and Kaye (2003) mentioned that a substantial amount of ASD is due to the characteristics of the parents as the cause. Studies have suggested a recurrence sibling risk of about 2-14% probability for a sibling to develop autism given that one sibling has ASD (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006). Twin studies have found a 40-60% concordance for autism in monozygotic (identical) as compared with dizygotic (fraternal) twins. These findings meant that in the identical set of twins if one twin met the criteria for ASD diagnosis the other twin was 40-60% likely to meet the criteria (Geier et al., 2010; Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006).  2.5 Comorbid Disorders  A study conducted in the United States of America (USA) by Leyfer et al. (2006) on a sample of 109 children from ages 5-17 assessed the presence of comorbid disorders in children with ASD. It was found that 32% had phobias of needles and crowds, 37% had Obsessive Compulsive Disorders (OCD), 31% had Attention Deficiency Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and 10% had Depression. Leyfer et al. (2006) mentioned that comorbid disorders are not easily detected and the rates of these comorbid disorders are usually not known. Simonoff, Pickles, Chandler, Loucas and Baird (2008) found even higher rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders. This study sampled 112 children between the ages of 10-14 years old and found that 70% of the children had one comorbid psychiatric disorder with ASD and 42 % had two comorbid disorders. The highest comorbid disorder was social anxiety 29% followed by ADHD and Oppositional Defiant Disorders 28% (Simonoff et al., 2008).  13   Intellectual Disorders (ID) have been found to co-vary with ASD (Matson & Shoemaker, 2009). ID is characterised by challenging behaviours, social cognitive and adaptive skills deficits. It is mentioned that about 40% of persons with ID have ASD, and 70% of persons with ASD have ID (Matson & Shoemaker, 2009). The rates of ASD and ID are about 50-70% of all ASD cases (Matson & Shoemaker, 2009).  Depression has been found to co-occur with ASD. The prevalence of depression in children with ASD has been reported to vary from 1.4 % to 38 % (Matson & Shoemaker, 2009; Magnuson & Constantino, 2011). Depression in children requires that parents take more than normal care giving duties of the child. Depression has long term outcomes and may put a person with ASD at a risk of committing suicide, non-compliance and aggression (Matson & Shoemaker, 2009; Magnuson & Constantino, 2011).    Gastrointestinal (GI) problems have been found to be common in children with ASD. Chronic constipation, diarrhoea is said to occur in 46-85% of children with ASD. Other studies have mentioned lower rates of 17-24% (Myers & Johnson, 2007). GI problems in children with ASD may contribute to the severity of the disorder. Pains associated with GI may likely to frustrate the child and thus leading to other problems such as reduced concentration, increase aggression mostly in those children who are unable to communicate their needs (Adams et al., 2011).  About 11%-39% of children with ASD suffer from seizures. It is mentioned that when mental retardation is present the prevalence of seizures in the child escalates to 42% (Myers & Johnson, 2007).  2.6. Parental Challenges  Parents and siblings play a key role in the effective treatment of ASD. The presence of ASD in a family brings about severe stress and to some degree depression may be experienced (Myers & Johnson, 2007). Families of children with ASD experience myriads of challenges in caring for their children. Most parents mentioned that they recognised that the child was different as early 14   as age two years and some parents reported that they recognised the differences in the child even before the age of two (Hutton & Caron, 2005). Parents mentioned that they recognized that there were differences in the child through observing certain delayed milestones in the child for example, child not babbling.   One other key concern parents mentioned is the difficulties in obtaining necessary services. They indicated that they were initially informed by practitioners that nothing was wrong with the child and subsequently sent home without examination. However parental instincts prevailed and most parents persisted until they received the care they were seeking (Hutton & Caron, 2005). The period surrounding the diagnosis of the child and the initiation of intervention services brings about a challenge in parenting children with ASD and these challenges have been found to elevate stress levels in parents (Hastings, 2003; Davis & Carter, 2008). Parents have also mentioned that the public and other family members demonstrated disapproval of the child‟s behaviour causing the parent anxiety and stress (Dabrowska & Pisula, 2010).   Parenting is a challenging experience and being a parent of a child with ASD could be even more demanding and may also pose a threat to the psychosocial well-being of parents (Higgins, Bailey & Pearce, 2005). To most parents the behaviour of the child is more of a salient stressor than the child‟s disorder (Hastings, 2003). Children with ASD experience regulatory problems such as eating problems and sleeping problems. These regulatory problems may be stressful to the parent and may preclude a normal family life (Higgins et al., 2005). Problems such as externalising behaviours are common in children with ASD. These problems include tantrums, aggression and hyperactivity (Boonen et al., 2014; Hastings, 2003). Externalizing problems have been found to affect parents‟ psychological wellbeing and contribute to levels of stress (Boonen et al., 2014).  Other factors that have been found to bring about challenges to parents are the severity of the disorder and the child‟s competencies. Parents of children with high incompetence such as not achieving age expected social and emotional milestones, showed higher parenting stress levels (Hastings, 2003).  Studies have compared parenting challenges in mothers and fathers of children with ASD and have yielded different research results. Other studies have found that stress levels in mothers and 15   fathers of children with ASD were comparable (Hastings, 2003; Davis & Carter; 2008). Mothers were more affected by the child‟s behaviour as compared to fathers. These findings may be due to reasons such as fathers being less involved in the daily responsibilities of the child as compared to mothers. Higgins et al. (2005) found a relationship between the mother‟s stress levels and the educational progress of the child.  In addition to these findings, mothers of children with ASD reported less marital satisfaction when compared with mothers of children with downs syndrome and typically developing children (Higgins et al., 2005). Above all, both fathers and mothers presented equal levels of stress and depressive symptoms when the child is young and upon receiving the child‟s diagnosis of ASD (Davis & Carter, 2008; Hastings, 2003).  2.7. Parent-Child Interaction Model  Mash and Johnston (1990) developed a model which illustrates factors that are related to parenting stress. This model uses a direct pathway (see figure 1) for the influences of the child, parent and the environment and it is recursive (Mash & Johnston, 1990). This implies that stress in the parent child model is seen as having an impact on the three aspects. The three aspects of the model out of a broader paradigm of parenting stress include the parent‟s characteristics, characteristics of the child and environmental characteristics. The model by Mash and Johnston (1990) was chosen for this study as it has been applied previously to families of hyperactive children and abused children. Similarities exist in behavioural problems of children with hyperactivity, abused children and children with ASD. These children may experience behavioural, cognitive, social and academic problems and are faced with a possibility of failing to adapt later in their lives (Barkely, 1998 ; Mash & Johnston, 1990;  Sternberg et al., 1993).  Parent‟s characteristics include the parent‟s psychological resources such as the affective state, personality and the general health of the parent (Mash & Johnston, 1990). This model illustrates that some characteristics may prevent stressful situations or may exaggerate them. A model by Bluth et al. (2013) for couples raising children with ASD supported this statement. The model illustrated that parents could prevent stressful situations by applying behaviour called mindfulness.  16                       The definition of mindfulness is “paying attention in a particular way, on purpose, in the present moment and nonjudgmentally” (Bluth   et al., 2013, p 204). The assumption is that humans are not aware of the moment and if mindfulness is not activated as a conscious state they may be faced with the consequences that may lead to possible future suffering (Bluth et al., 2013). For example, parents may apply automatic processing by telling a hyperactive child to slow down. These responses may become automatic and without any conscious cognitive effort (Mash & Johnston, 1990).  The child‟s characteristics include temperament, cognition and regulatory problems (Davies & Carter, 2008; Bluth et al., 2013; Mash & Johnston, 1990). These characteristics can promote the negative control orientated parent child interactions. Behaviours such as aggression and property destruction change the parents‟ behaviour (Davies & Carter, 2008; Mash & Johnston, 1990). This was supported by a study conducted (Anderson, Lytton & Romney, 1986; Brunk & Child Characteristics Environmental Characteristics Parent Characteristics Parent-Child Interactive Stress Figure 1        Model of Stress in Parent-Child Interaction by Mash & Johnston, 1990  17   Henggeler, 1984; Mash, 1984), this study found that children‟s behavioural problems may bring about a predictable type of parental control.  Environmental characteristics include major life events, poverty, social isolation and daily hassles. These have been found to have negative effects on parent child interactions (Mash & Johnston, 1990).  Macro level factors such as poverty have been acknowledged as factors having a negative impact on child problems and ASD outcomes (Cuccaro et al., 1996; Mash & Johnston, 1990; Mandell, Novak & Zubritsky, 2005; Marcus et al., 2001; Schopler, 2005).   2.8. Resilience  The term „resilience‟ stems from early psychiatric literature that studied children who appeared to be invulnerable to adverse life events (Earvolino-Ramirez, 2007). The terms „invincible‟ and „invulnerable‟ were used interchangeably in the early literature (Anthony, 1974). Walsh (2003) defined resilience as the ability to bounce back from adversities and cope successfully.   Early literature referred to resilience as a personality trait until in the recent studies where it has been redefined as a dynamic, modifiable process (Earvolino-Ramirez, 2007). Individuals respond to different circumstances differently. How an individual responds in one particular situation may not determine a similar response in a different situation. It is mentioned that resilient individuals have common characteristics called protective factors and these factors are attributes that are needed in order to allow the process of resilience to occur (Earvolino‐Ramirez, 2007). Resilience is a process of going through the worst time and bringing out the best in an individual. Often, challenges have been seen to yield learning, transformation and yield an individual to a better life direction (Walsh, 2003).  Walsh (2006) extended the concept of resilience to family resilience. The premise of the framework was that families and couples also need strength and support in crisis situations. The concept of family resilience focused on shifting families from a point of being damaged towards 18   being challenged (Walsh, 2003). It is mentioned that while some families are discouraged by crisis or persistent stresses, others emerge strengthened and more resourceful (Walsh, 2003).  Families of children with ASD are faced with a variety of challenges. Despite these challenges a number of families have shown evidence of resilience (Bayat, 2007). Some families have become advocates of their children‟s condition. Such actions of advocacy are qualities and components that qualify an individual or family to be considered as resilient (Bayat, 2007).  2.8.1. Family Resilience Framework  The family resilience framework by Walsh (2003) was developed to assist families beyond managing stressful conditions but also in shouldering or surviving during periods of ordeals.  Parents of children with ASD come from all walks of life and they have different backgrounds and beliefs. Thus, a framework of resilience embraces these differences. It is grounded on a principle that there is no single model that fits all situations (Walsh, 2003). The framework further acknowledges that every family has potential to recover and grow out of adverse difficult situations (Walsh, 2003). This framework was developed through drawing findings from different research studies. It is divided into three different domains (family beliefs, organisation patterns and communication) as core pillars of the framework which will be discussed in detail below. There are a total of nine underlying sub-constructs to this theory.                   19   Figure 2                 Framework of Family Resilience by Walsh (2003)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Making Meaning of Adversity Flexibility Clarity Positive Outlook Connectedness Open Emotion Transcendence and Spirituality Social and Economic Resources Collaborative Problem Solving 20   2.8.2. Family Belief System  The family‟s belief system shapes and influences how an event is approached. The family‟s view of reality and its socialisation organises family processes and approaches to crisis situations (Walsh 2003).  Making meaning of adversity: Some cultures apply an individualistic approach in problem solving and others a collective approach. Families who work collectively are able to better deal with challenges when compared to individualistic families.  Research suggests that most families do better when they are helped to gain a sense of cohesion (Walsh, 2003).   Positive Outlook: Families who live in impoverished conditions may eventually lose hope about life in general. This despair robs them of meaning, purpose and a sense of future possibility (Walsh, 2003). Families who are hopeful have been found to deal better with family challenges and rise above them. Walsh mentioned that when challenges overwhelm families it is “essential to rekindle hopes and dreams in order to see possibilities, tap into potential resources and strive to overcome them” (Walsh, 2003, p 8).  Transcendence and Spirituality: An individual‟s faith, congregation affiliation, and religion have been found to be other sources of resilience. Religion and faith however are not the only sources where people find spiritual connection. Some people find spiritual connection through nature, music and art (Walsh, 2003). Beliefs, rituals and ceremonies provide strength, comfort, meaning and purpose to families who are undergoing challenging periods (Walsh, 2013).  2.8.3. Organisation Patterns  In order to deal with challenges, families need to adapt and organise themselves in different ways to deal with the demands of a crisis situation. This part discusses the family‟s flexible structure, connectedness and the social and economic situation of the family.  21   Flexibility: Becvar and Becvar (2000) defined flexibility as the capacity to change when necessary. The presence of a child with autism changes the face of the family. Families often need help in dealing with child‟s disorder and to construct a new family structure. Sixbey (2005) mentioned the importance of a stable and flexible family environment.  Stability assists the family with continuity and dependability and all members in the family feel it. Stability provides predictability and consistency in family rules (Sixbey, 2005). Structure and stability could be achieved through applying authoritative leadership, and leadership style promotes flexibility (Becvaar & Becvaar, 2000; Sixbey, 2005). Thus, applying flexibility could assist families in bouncing back to the family‟s pre-existing state.    Connectedness: Togetherness and unity are necessary for families to deal with adverse life challenges. Having a crisis or a child with autism can shatter family cohesion if members are unable to turn to one another (Walsh, 2003). Families with resilience are able to harness affected family connections when faced with challenges. This reunion builds broken bonds and assists family members to deal with a crisis situation (Sixbey, 2005).  Social and economic resources: Family and community networks are important lifelines for families who are undergoing challenges. Families who are isolated could benefit from reconnecting with their communities and other family members in times of troubles (Walsh, 2003). Scarcity of resources such as economic strains may compound the adverse crisis. For an example a family may find costs associated with the child‟s therapy unattainable and thus worsen the crisis situation (Walsh, 2003).  2.8.4. Communication and Problem Solving  It is possible for parents of children with ASD to lack knowledge of the disorder before the child‟s diagnosis stage. Therefore communicating about the disorder may bring them closer to a problem solving stage. For this reason, family communication brings about clarity to a crisis during periods of despair (Walsh, 2003). Three components of communication and problem solving will be discussed below, namely clarity, open emotion and collaboration. 22    Clarity: Walsh (2003) discusses clarity as a means of sharing crucial information amongst family members. Clarity also assists in filling in missing information and clarifying hearsays on the topic being discussed. Families may also use clarity to share information about the crisis situation in the family for example a family facing a crisis of having a child with ASD may empower one another with information about what to expect in the future in order to make meaningful decisions about the child.   Open emotion:  By sharing emotions families can deal with the challenge of having a child with ASD. For an example one parent may respond to the situation by using humour when others are saddened by the situation. It is important for families to control their emotions whenever there is a crisis in the family. Families should take caution during emotional periods because high emotions are likely to bring about conflicts in the family (Walsh, 2003).  Collaborative problem solving: Conflicts are common in all families. Solving problems is often not a simple process to most families. Effective families recognize that problems exist and work on better ways to solve them. Families that are resilient are able to involve one another and brainstorm on the potential ways they can approach problems (Sixbey, 2005). Family members negotiate possible decisions with fairness and accommodate one another. This helps them open new possibilities and shift from being in a crisis to a proactive position. Collaborative problem solving assists families in prioritizing and taking concrete steps towards achieving desired goals and also to learn from their own experiences (Walsh, 2003).  2.9. Socio-Economic Status  While previous studies have found no etiological associations between ASD and SES, there is however a growing body of knowledge which acknowledges that the family‟s SES may have a negative impact on the outcome of a child with ASD (Dawson, 2011; Mandel et al., 2005). SES indicators have an association with children‟s verbal skills and cognitive development (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). A study by Greef and van Der Walt, (2010) on resilience in families of 23   children with ASD found that SES of families appeared to play a role in the family‟s adaptation. Middle SES families were found to adapt better in raising a child with ASD. The more resources people have the less likely they experience diseases since they have the ability to devote more of their resources to their health (King & Bearman, 2011). Thus other studies have found that higher SES families are able to cope better with a child with ASD when compared to lower SES families (Greef & van Der Walt, 2010).  It is also important to emphasize that underprivileged families are unable to access diagnosis early and timeously (Dawson, 2011; Mandel et al., 2005). For example, public health facilities are difficult to navigate and the costs of private health care facilities are not easily accessible to all, especially to those affected by psychological and mental illnesses (Pretorius & Ahmed, 2001; Dawson, 2011). Such challenges in the South African context could have negative implications for children with ASD. About 50% of South Africans live in poverty and lack proper facilities in their communities    (Dawson, 2011).   Also, a shortage of professionals in the psychiatry field may have negative outcomes in ASD in South Africa. According to Pillay and Lockhart (2001) South Africa provides one child psychiatrist to a population of 1 million children.  Mandel et al., (2005, 2009) found that a parent‟s income and place of residence as well as pediatricians that the child has seen is associated with the age at which the child receives a diagnosis of ASD. Children from poor families and rural areas where there are limited health facilities have been found to receive diagnosis much later when compared to their counterparts (Mandel et al., 2005, 2009). One study found that children from rural areas received their diagnosis 0.4 months later when compared to children from urban areas and children from poor households received diagnosis 0.9 months later when compared to children from middle or upper income groups (Mandel et al., 2005, 2009). Such differences in SES pose challenges in parents as well as the development of a child.   Some studies have shown that parenting behaviour is not only influenced by SES, some parents show no difference in parenting even after taking into account SES (Emmen et al., 2013). Hasnain & Akter (2014) found that children with ASD were mostly common in low SES families, and only a small percentage of autistic children among these families attended school. A study by Smith (1999) observed that children with autism who receive early behavioural 24   intervention presented with improved cognition and adaptive behaviour. Lower SES parents may not be able to access these interventions due costs.  According to the family stress model (Conger & Donnella, 2007), economic pressures increase the risk of parental emotional distress which may lead to increased marital conflict and this process negatively affects parenting. This model states that when child rearing is threatened, it places the child‟s development in serious jeopardy (Conger & Donnella, 2007).  Ataguba, Akazali and Mcintyre (2011) mention that the poor face many factors which are recognised as social determinants of ill health. This is the case also in South Africa, according to the National Health Insurance Green Paper, (2011) majority of South Africans do not have access to the available
