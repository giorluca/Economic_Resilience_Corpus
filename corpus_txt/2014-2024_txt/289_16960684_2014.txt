As both mitigation and adaptation are components of any climate change strategy, the four papers presented here use laboratory and field experiments to examine different dimensions of individuals’ mitigation and adaptive behaviour.   The papers in Section 1 utilise framed public good games to focus on two different aspects of the public goods dilemma synonymous with climate change mitigation. In this context, the first paper ‘What is fair? An experimental guide to climate negotiations’ examines the degree to which the use of particular burden-sharing principles in multilateral climate change negotiations reflects self-interest. The multi-country public good game is conducted with a sample of individuals from the United States, European Union, China, India and South Africa. The results signal the use of the historical and future polluter-pays rules by American and Chinese participants to reflect self-interest.  The potential for groups of heterogeneous individuals to meet a collective emission-reduction target through individual contributions is examined in the second paper: ‘Cooperation and Climate Change: Can Communication Facilitate the Provision of Public Goods in Heterogeneous Agents?” Heterogeneity is framed as differences in participants’ marginal abatement costs. While communication promotes cooperation, even when heterogeneity is present, the non-binding nature of communication results in the two dominant contribution strategies of free-riding and perfect-cooperation.   The papers in Section 2 examine the role of risk and uncertainty in individuals’ adaptive strategies. The correlation between risk attitudes and individuals’ flood adaptation strategies is examined in the third paper: ‘Risk Attitudes and Adaptation: Experimental Evidence from a Flood Prone Urban Informal Settlement in South Africa.’ Risk attitudes are elicited from a series of lottery tasks conducted across a sample of individuals living in a flood-prone urban informal settlement. The results indicate that individuals adopting more effective (and costly) adaptation strategies are more risk averse.   The fourth paper ‘Risk Preferences, Technology Adoption and Insurance Uptake’ uses lottery tasks and a framed insurance game to examine whether the provision of a framed index insurance product induces individuals to opt into riskier but potentially more profitable activities. Experiment participants are small-scale and subsistence urban food growers. The results indicate that risk-averse individuals are more likely to opt into traditional agriculture and are less likely to use modern farming inputs that require financing.

These changes can, in turn, impact significantly on the well-being of ecosystems, wildlife and humans, through more frequent flooding and droughts and an increase in heat-related illnesses (Stern Review 2006, IPCC 2007). The livelihoods of the poor are likely to be most adversely affected as climate-change-related hazards manifest through a reduction in crop yields, increased food prices and food insecurity, damage to home and property and even displacement (IPCC 2013).    Against this backdrop, this thesis examines the implications of certain insights from behavioural economics for climate change policy. More specifically, any public policy response must address both mitigation and adaption (to be discussed in the proceeding subsections). In this context, the papers in this thesis consider: (i) self-interested use of equity preferences and, more so, the impact of material self-interest on cooperation in the negotiating process; (ii) the effect of heterogeneous mitigation costs on cooperation in meeting a domestic emission-reduction target; (iii) the relationship between risk attitudes and choice of adaptation strategy in the context of uncertainty around the timing and severity of climate variability; and (iv), the relationship between risk attitudes and adaptation when proposed adaptive strategies have uncertain outcomes.   1 Mitigation  Mitigation, in which the sources of greenhouse gas emissions are reduced (IPCC 2014), is a vital component of any strategy addressing climate change.                                                            1 Where climate change relates to changes in the mean and/or variability of the climate (for example temperature, extreme weather events, precipitation) that persist for an extended duration (typically decades or longer), due in part to anthropogenic activities (IPCC 2013). Note that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (Article 1) attributes climate change directly to human activity – distinguishing it from natural climate variability (UNFCCC, 1992).  Univeristy of Cape Town 2   Within this context of mitigation, climate change typifies a global collective action problem in as much as the emissions of any agent (an individual, company or country, for example) affect other agents and accumulate in the atmosphere over time, mixing globally (IPCC 2013, Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008). More specifically, climate change mitigation exemplifies the collective action problem known as a public good dilemma; specifically, while there is broad consensus that a significant reduction of greenhouse gases is needed to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change, as the benefits of (costly) mitigation are shared equally by all irrespective of individual contribution, there is considerable incentive to free ride (Hasson et al. 2010, Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008).  The current model for tackling climate change is a top-down approach in terms of which emission reduction targets are first negotiated at multilateral climate talks and then implemented at a domestic level by national governments, through the formulation of climate policy. In both these international and domestic settings, since no single country or individual can adequately provide the public good of mitigation and significant incentives for free-riding tend to prevail, widespread participation is needed for climate policy to be effective (Ringius et al. 2002). With respect to the implementation of international environmental agreements, no single supranational authority can enforce cooperation and, in a domestic setting, in instances where cooperation can be enforced through penalties for non-compliance, monitoring, verification and enforcement is costly.  On a global scale, international environmental agreements like the Kyoto Protocol require countries with divergent levels of income and historical responsibility for emissions to agree on how best to distribute an abatement burden and apportion future entitlements to emissions. On a country level, reducing a national greenhouse gas inventory requires a change in behaviour from both industry sectors and individuals, both of which categories are asymmetric as regards income, energy consumption, abatement costs and historical emissions. As such, climate change mitigation is a prime example of a public good dilemma in which stakeholders are heterogeneous.   Furthermore, given the historical responsibility of developed nations for the existing stock of greenhouse gases, combined with both the greater vulnerability of developing economies to climate change as well as their need to pursue developmental objectives, the notion of equity Univeristy of Cape Town 3  has become a cornerstone of the global climate change debate. Specifically, the 1998 Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC in Article 10 exemplifies this sentiment by stating the need for “common but differentiated responsibilities” according to specific “national and regional development priorities” (UNFCCC, 1992).   There is a large behavioural economic literature offering insights into the conditions under which people cooperate, even when it is not in their own self-interest to do so (Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008). The experimental evidence indicates that people are, to some extent, concerned with achieving outcomes that they perceive to be fair.2 However, several studies also provide evidence of a self-serving bias, under which individuals’ judgement of what is fair is often aligned with their own self-interest (Babcock, Wang and Loewenstein 1996, Babcock and Loewenstein 1997 and Babcock et al. 1997). In relation to climate negotiations, since different equity principles have different cost implications for different countries, the use of a particular equity principle may be based on fairness considerations or, alternatively, may reflect self-interest (for example to soften the emission-reduction target allocated to your particular country (Lange et al. 2007, Lange et al. 2010, Ringius et al. 2002, Carlsson et al. 2013).   Furthermore, and again implying a preference for fairness, the experimental evidence from public good games with symmetric players and sanctioning reflects the contribution norm of equal contributions (Reuben and Riedl 2013).3 However, in a climate change setting characterised by heterogeneity, it is not immediately clear whether individuals will be able to reach consensus on a contribution norm. While communication has been found to be effective in facilitating cooperation in public good games in a homogeneous setting (Gächter and Herrmann 2009), when players are heterogeneous, communication might prove to be counterproductive, emphasising dissimilarities between players and amplifying disagreement, rather than fostering cooperation.                                                              2 For example, contrary to theory, people make positive (although often suboptimal) contributions in public good games (Ledyard 1995). Fischbacher et al. (2001) and Fehr and Fischbacher (2004) find that cooperation reflects the norm of conditional cooperation which prescribes cooperation if group members cooperate and defection if group members defect. Laboratory experiments also provide evidence consistent with reciprocity, in which subjects reward kind actions toward them and punish unkind actions (Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008, Gachter and Hermann 2009).  3 In games with punishment opportunities, a number of authors have found that punishment increases as the differential between individual contributions and average group contributions widens (Fehr and Gächter 2000, Fehr and Gächter 2002, Anderson and Putterman 2006, Hofmeyr et al. 2008, Visser and Burns 2013). Univeristy of Cape Town 4  To examine outcomes within this context, the first paper of this thesis “What is fair? An experimental guide to climate negotiations” considers the role of equity in multilateral climate change negotiations and, more specifically, the self-interested use of burden-sharing principles. The second paper “Cooperation and Climate Change: Can Communication Facilitate the Provision of Public Goods in Heterogeneous Settings?” explores the potential for cooperation in meeting a national emission-reduction target when individuals are heterogeneous. These papers are discussed in more detail in the following subsections.   1.1 What is fair? An experimental guide to climate negotiations  Multilateral climate change negotiations and international environmental agreements are mechanisms through which to coordinate a global response to climate change. In this collective action problem, no single country can unilaterally provide the public good of mitigation, no supranational authority exists to enforce cooperation, and countries are incentivised to free-ride given the public good characteristics of climate change mitigation (Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008, Lange et al. 2010). As such, where voluntary cooperation across countries is needed to reduce emissions, equity principles are commonly used in multilateral climate negotiations to guide the discourse (Lange et al. 2007). While choice of burden-sharing principle purportedly reflects negotiators’ fairness ideals, because the application of different equity principles translates into different financial costs and reduction obligations, the use of equity principles likely also reflects economic self-interest (Ringius et al. 2002).   Under these assumptions, employing a threshold public good game with a climate change framing, real monetary incentives, and drawing on a cross-section of individuals from the United States, the European Union, China, India and South Africa, this multi-country study examines the degree to which the use of burden-sharing principles reflects self-interest. In an initial treatment, participants, who represent the country of which they are a national, choose between various burden-sharing principles. In a subsequent treatment, drawing inspiration from Rawls’ “veil of ignorance”, participants are unaware of which country they represent, and are randomly allocated to a country after making their decision. The burden-sharing principles incorporated into the experiment include the egalitarian rule (equal per capita emissions), the polluter-pays rule, and the sovereignty rule (equal percentage reduction of Univeristy of Cape Town 5  current emissions) (Lange et al. 2007, Lange et al. 2010, Cazorla and Toman 2000, Winkler et al. 2001, Ringius et al. 2002).   The results reveal the use of the historical and future polluter-pays rule by American and Chinese participants to be consistent with self-interest. Conversely, there is no evidence of self-interested use of burden-sharing principles among European participants. In both treatments (own and random nationality), European participants select the burden-sharing principles that are most costly for the European Union and that are often advocated by negotiators from developing countries.   1.2 Cooperation and Climate Change: Can Communication Facilitate the Provision of Public Goods in Heterogeneous Agents?  Stakeholder participation in domestic policy processes occurs in extremely complex environments amid large divergences in historical energy usage among different sectors of society, party-politics, special-interest lobbying, alternative developmental priorities and environmental objectives and concerns relating to social and distributive justice.   Despite this complexity, the need for public good provision (meeting an emission-reduction target) in this domestic setting is extremely important given that while the current multilateral, top-down, rules-based approach of the Kyoto Protocol assigns each country a quantifiable and binding emission-reduction target, each country formulates and implements its own domestic climate policy agenda. In this context, this article considers the role of communication (and by extension, stakeholder participation) in facilitating success in meeting a national mitigation obligation when a large degree of heterogeneity exists amongst those engaging in the policy process.    To do so, using a linear public good game with a climate change framing, the experiment reported here examines whether groups of heterogeneous individuals can meet a collective emission-reduction target through individual contributions. Heterogeneity is introduced into the experiment by varying players’ marginal productivity to the public good. In terms of the experiment framing, this means that players have different marginal costs of abatement, meaning that it is cheaper for a particular player type to reduce an additional unit of emissions Univeristy of Cape Town 6  relative to another player type. The experiment consists of two treatments: a standard public good game and a communication treatment where participants are able to communicate with their group members in order to discuss how best to meet the target.   While communication is found to improve public good provision, even when heterogeneity is present, the non-binding nature of communication results in significant levels of free-riding. In particular, with the introduction of communication, two dominant contribution norms of free-riding and perfect-cooperation emerge. This outcome emphasises the importance of sanctioning opportunities in ensuring compliance with mitigation obligations.    2 Adaptation  Adaptation, which refers to action taken to prevent or minimise the expected adverse effects associated with climate change, is the sole response to the climactic impacts that will register over the next several decades before mitigation measures have an effect (Stern Review 2006). As such, the unavoidable impacts of climate change must also be addressed though adaptation policy (EU 2009).   While there is now broad consensus regarding the consequences of climate change, there is continued uncertainty around the timing and severity of climate change impacts (IPCC 2013). Accordingly, responding to the risks inherent in climate change (through adaptation) involves decision-making under uncertainty.   In addition to the uncertainty characterising the adverse impacts of climate change, proposed adaptation strategies may also have uncertain outcomes. For example, within a developing country context, while the adoption of new farming practices to reduce vulnerability to climate change has the potential to engender significant yield improvements, these practices are also potentially more risky relative to traditional agriculture. Mosley and Verschoor (2005) discuss the risk-induced poverty trap: poor individuals who are risk averse – and thus unwilling to invest in riskier modern inputs – will remain poor, while wealthier individuals who are in a position to better insulate themselves from risk will benefit from technological innovations. With this in mind, any proposed adaptation policy with uncertain outcomes must take into Univeristy of Cape Town 7  account individuals’ aversion to risk and the manner in which they make choices under conditions of uncertainty (Harrison et al. 2010).   In this connection, the final two papers of this thesis focus on risk aversion and uncertainty in the context of adaptation. The third paper, “Risk Attitudes and Adaptation: Experimental Evidence from a Flood Prone Urban Informal Settlement in South Africa” categorises risk attitudes in terms of two popular theories of decision-making under uncertainty (namely: Expected Utility Theory and Prospect Theory), and examines the correlation between risk attitudes and choice of flood adaptation strategy. The fourth and final paper, “Risk Preferences, Technology Adoption and Insurance Uptake” explores the potential for index-insurance to induce risk-averse individuals to opt into riskier and potentially more profitable farming practices.   2.1 Risk Attitudes and Adaptation: Experimental Evidence from a Flood-Prone Urban Informal Settlement in South Africa  This study characterises the risk attitudes and, more specifically the relationship between risk attitudes and flood adaptation, of a sample of individuals living in a flood-prone urban informal settlement. Decisions around flood adaptation involve significant stakes. In particular, vulnerability to flood risk – and the associated damage to property and possessions and diminished wellbeing – is partly determined by individuals’ choice of adaptation strategy. To examine this relationship further, the object of this paper is to determine the extent to which risk attitudes are correlated with choice of adaptation strategy.    The experiment reported in this paper replicates the design of Harrison and Rutström (2009) in which subjects are provided with 60 lottery tasks and, for each lottery task, choose between two lottery pairs. While the participants partake in either a gain, mixed or loss frame, endowments are used to equalise the payoffs across the frames. Participants also complete a survey, capturing information on their demographic characteristics as well as their attitudes to flood adaptation. The sample consists of 174 individuals living in the BM Section of Khayelitsha, a flood-prone urban informal settlement situated in Cape Town.   Univeristy of Cape Town 8  The results imply that flood adaptation is correlated with risk preferences. Four flood adaptation strategies are incorporated into the model, ranging along the spectrum from least effective (least costly) to most effective (most costly), namely: opt to do nothing, rely solely on plastic sheeting for waterproofing the floor and/or walls of the dwelling, raise the home above ground using sandbags, pallets or stilts, and finally, slant the roof to facilitate rainwater runoff. The results indicate that participants opting to slant their roofs are more risk-averse relative to their counterparts who opt for the remaining strategies.   2.2 Risk Preferences, Technology Adoption and Insurance Uptake  Subsistence farmers in developing countries who are dependent on rain-fed crop production as a livelihood source are extremely vulnerable to climate variability. This vulnerability is exacerbated by widespread poverty and limited access to credit and insurance markets. Amid these circumstances, key factors in the slow rate of technology diffusion in developing countries include risk aversion and imperfect credit and insurance markets (Giné et al. 2008, Giné and Yang 2009, Humphrey and Verschoor 2004).   Farmers’ investment behaviour is constrained in environments where they lack access to the credit facilities necessary to finance new farming practices, with a number of studies showing adoption of new farming technologies and inputs to be correlated with wealth (Croppenstedt et al. 2003, Cole at al. 2013, Giné et al. 2008 and Chirwa 2005). However, even in situations where credit is accessible but where access to insurance is limited or non-existent, potential borrowers are deterred from taking loans amid the high costs associated with loan default (for example, in the event of crop failure) (Giné and Yang 2009). More broadly, because modern farming practices are potentially more profitable but also more risky, households attempting to insulate themselves from fluctuations in income might opt to stay with traditional agricultural methods (Dercon and Christiaensen 2011). Risk-averse farmers might therefore opt for lower-yielding, traditional farming technologies that do not require financing (Giné and Yang 2009). As such, the provision of insurance, which minimises the default costs and consumption fluctuations associated with production failure, should, in theory, increase adoption rates among risk-averse farmers.  To disentangle the effects of credit constraints from appetite for risk, the experiment reported in this paper isolates the impact of risk aversion on adoption behaviour in two steps. First, a Univeristy of Cape Town 9  framed game is used to identify which farmers choose low-risk, low-yield strategies. Next, the game tests whether the provision of insurance induces those individuals who choose the low-risk strategies in the first part of the experiment to opt into more risky but potentially more profitable activities in the second part. Farmers’ risk preferences are also elicited using simple lottery tasks for real monetary prizes.   The results of this experiment indicate that risk aversion is negatively correlated with adoption of new farming technologies. Specifically, within the context of the framed simulations, individuals who are more risk averse are less likely to opt into insurance relative to traditional farming strategies. These results provide empirical support for the risk-induced poverty-trap argument, and contribute to the debate around the surprisingly low uptake of index insurance products. While the insurance product in this experiment is designed to reduce the loss experienced by the participants in the event of crop failure, it does not remove this loss entirely, reflecting the reality that index insurance does not remove all risk from the production process under real-life circumstances; specifically, even if a particular index insurance product completely removed the production risk associated with rainfall variability, arguably the most important source of production risk for farmers in developing countries, it would not pay out for crop damage derived from other factors (such as pests), known as basis risk (Barrett et al. 2007). Thus, in order to overcome risk aversion among poor individuals stuck in the poverty cycle, and to facilitate the uptake of insurance products, basis risk and residual production risk not accounted for by the insurance product must be addressed.

An Experimental Guide to Climate Negotiations  Kerri Brick and Martine Visser  Abstract International commitments to reduce emissions should ideally be negotiated between countries in a manner considered to be fair or equitable. While the burden-sharing principles commonly advocated in climate negotiations reflect different views of what constitutes a fair way to distribute the abatement burden, their use can also be strategically motivated to legitimise a specific bargaining position. In this context, using a threshold public good game with a climate change framing, real monetary incentives and drawing on a sample of individuals from the United States, the European Union, China, India and South Africa, this multi-country study examines the degree to which the use of burden-sharing principles reflects material self-interest. In an initial treatment, participants, who represent the country of which they are a national, choose between various burden-sharing principles. In a subsequent treatment, drawing from Rawls’ veil of ignorance, participants are unaware of which country they represent and are randomly allocated to a country after making their decision. A comparison of participants’ choices across these two treatments indicates that the use of the historical and future polluter-pays rules by American and Chinese participants is consistent with material self-interest, or, in other words, self-interested use of burden-sharing principles.

Univeristy of Cape Town 15  1 Introduction  Climate science indicates that a significant reduction of greenhouse gases is needed to reduce the risk of catastrophic climate change. Multilateral climate change negotiations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and international environmental agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, are mechanisms through which to coordinate a global response to climate change. In this collective action problem, no single country can unilaterally provide the public good of mitigation, no supranational authority exists to enforce cooperation and countries are incentivised to free-ride given that while there is a private cost associated with mitigation, the benefits are shared equally between all countries (Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008, Lange et al. 2010). In this setting, where voluntary cooperation across countries is needed to reduce emissions, climate negotiators must reach consensus on emission-reduction targets that are considered by the majority to be fair or equitable (Ringius et al. 2002).  Within this context, equity is an important subtext of the climate change debate with the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” (UNFCCC, 1992) shaping the narrative. More specifically, equity principles are commonly used in multilateral climate negotiations to guide the formulation of burden-sharing agreements (Lange et al. 2007).   While choice of burden-sharing principle purportedly reflects negotiators’ fairness ideals, because the application of different equity principles translates into different financial costs, reduction obligations and carbon entitlements1, and as negotiators are directed by domestic politics and sentiment, the use of equity principles likely also reflects economic or material self-interest (Ringius et al. 2002). In this context, several studies provide evidence of a self-serving bias – where individuals’ judgements of what is fair are often aligned with their own self-interest (Babcock, Wang and Loewenstein 1996, Babcock and Loewenstein 1997, Babcock et al. 1997, Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008). This self-serving bias is of particular interest in the context of multilateral climate change negotiations where, as multiple burden-sharing principles can conceivably be advocated by a particular country, there is room for self-interested use of burden-sharing principles within a large set of legitimate equity                                                           1 Also referred to as the “right to emit” (Winkler et al. 2001). Univeristy of Cape Town 16  arguments (Ringius et al. 2002).  In this way, negotiators may use legitimate-sounding burden-sharing principles to prevent their country being assigned a legally binding reduction target or, at the very least, to minimise the target (Lange et al. 2007, 2010).   While there is a large body of literature reviewing the equity principles most commonly advocated during climate negotiations and assessing their implications at the country-level (Ringius et al. 1998, Cazorla and Toman 2000, Ringius et al. 2002, Torvanger and Ringius 2002, Torvanger and Godal  2004, Winkler et al. 2001; see Carlsson et al. 2013 for a discussion), few studies elicit preferences for burden-sharing principles ( with the exception of Lange et al. 2007, Lange et al. 2010 and Carlsson et al. 2013).   In this context, the experiment reported here examines the extent to which individuals’ use of equity principles reflects material self-interest (in other words, whether individuals use equity principles in a self-serving way). To do so, when playing a threshold public good game with a climate change framing, participants of different nationalities choose between various equity principles, where each equity principle denotes a specific public good contribution. More specifically, the cost rankings of the respective equity principles (in terms of the associated public good contributions) differ across regions: for example, as will be discussed, while the principles of equal per capita emissions and historical polluter-pays are most costly for the United States (specify the largest contribution to the public good), they are least costly for China and India. In an initial treatment, when choosing between the various equity principles, each player represents the country of which they are a national (for example, the payoff function of the United States is relevant for the American participant). In line with the findings of Lange et al. (2010) and Carlsson et al. (2013), choice of equity principle for American and Chinese players is found to be in line with material self-interest, with both American and Chinese participants opting for equity principles that prescribe the smallest contribution to the public good and are generally synonymous with the largest payoffs.       This result, that choice of burden-sharing principle is (at least partly) derived from material self-interest, is important in the context of multilateral climate negotiations where the equity principle that an agent adheres to will likely affect or shape the negotiating process (and by extension, the negotiation outcome). Against this background, this experiment further examines the impact of self-interest on the negotiating process. To do so, in a second treatment, while participants must once again choose between the various burden-sharing principles, they Univeristy of Cape Town 17  do so from behind a veil of ignorance (Rawls 1971), where they no longer know which payoff function is applicable to them. The results indicate that American and Chinese participants are both more likely to select equity principles that prescribe a larger contribution to the public good in the veil-of-ignorance treatment; the outcome of which is greater success in meeting the threshold.    The burden-sharing principles incorporated into the experiment are some of those most commonly found in the literature and advocated in climate negotiations, namely, the egalitarian rule (equal per capita emissions), the polluter-pays rule and the sovereignty rule (equal percentage reduction of current emissions) (Lange et al. 2007, Lange et al. 2010, Cazorla and Toman 2000, Winkler et al. 2001, Ringius et al. 2002).2   The experiment draws on a sample of university students and what are referred to as “practitioners”. The term practitioner refers to those individuals who frequently engage with climate change related issues (for example, academics and researchers, individuals from non-governmental organisations and government officials), while students are considered to be more representative of the general public.  Five regions are included in the experiment, namely the United States (US), European Union (EU), China, India and South Africa (SA); and each group consists of a national from one of these regions.   Building on the design of Milinski et al. (2008) and Tavoni et al. (2011), the experiment is designed as a provision point (threshold) public good game. In terms of the structure of the game, participants are provided with an endowment that is to be allocated between a public good or private account, where allocations to the public good are framed as mitigation. When the groups’ total public good contributions equals or exceeds the provision point, which is framed as the threshold for dangerous climate change, public good contributions are multiplied by some factor and divided equally among the players. The setup is thus equivalent to a continuous public good game (Croson and Marks 1998). In terms of the experiment framing, participants are told that because there are no borders in the atmosphere, a reduction in                                                           2 The Ability to Pay rule, whereby wealthier countries are responsible for a greater share of the abatement burden (Winkler et al. 2001) is also frequently cited in both the literature and negotiations but is omitted from this design. As the experiment was conducted online, in the interests of keeping the design as cognitively simple as possible, the number of equity principles incorporated into the experiment was limited. Equity principles that emphasized fairness considerations as well as generated the largest payoff variation across all players were prioritized for inclusion.  Univeristy of Cape Town 18  emissions by one country is shared by all countries and, furthermore, that the return from mitigation (the public good) signifies the global benefits synonymous with mitigation, such as reduced climate variability and a reduced probability of environmental disaster.   Conversely, when contributions fail to meet the threshold, players do not receive any return from contributions to the public good. Additionally, players representing developed countries lose 25% of the experimental currency units (ECUs) allocated to the private account while developing countries lose 50%. Once again, in terms of the framing, it is assumed that mitigation was not sufficient to subvert the negative effects of climate change and that each player (region) is obliged to use a portion of the funds in his or her private account for adaptation and to fund disaster relief. Developing countries will need more severe adaptation and disaster relief measures and thus lose a greater portion of ECUs from their private accounts.  With respect to the design, the cost rankings (in terms of contributions to the public good) of the equity principles differ among the regions included in the experiment (for example, the historical polluter-pays principle is more costly for developed countries and thus prescribes a larger public good contribution for the US and EU relative to China, India and SA).   Lange et al. (2010) notes that, because the financial cost associated with each equity principle differs among regions (in other words, the cost ranking of equity principles differs among regions), self-interested use of burden-sharing principles necessitates that different regions support different equity principles to different degrees. As such, it was important to include both these elements (different cost rankings and different regions) into the design.   Broadly, the estimation results reveal that the use of the historical and future polluter-pays rule by American and Chinese participants is consistent with material self-interest. Specifically, when representing the US, American participants are less likely to select the principle of historical polluter-pays relative to other nationalities; however, this effect disappears when participants are randomly allocated to a country. Chinese participants are less likely to select the principle of future polluter-pays when representing their own nationality, but this effect also dissipates when the participants are randomly assigned a country. Furthermore, when representing the country of which they are a national, the majority of American and Chinese participants favour the least costly burden-sharing principles. Conversely, there is no evidence of self-interested use of burden-sharing principles among European and Indian participants. In both treatments (own and random nationality), European participants in particular select the Univeristy of Cape Town 19  burden-sharing principles that are most costly for the EU and that are often advocated by negotiators from developing countries.   The paper proceeds as follows: a literature review is provided in Section 2, while Section 3 provides a description of the sample. The experiment design is outlined in Section 4. The results are provided in Section 5, while Section 6 concludes with a discussion.   2 Literature review  In the context of multilateral climate negotiations, a central point of contention surrounds how to share a given abatement burden (Dannenberg et al. 2010). With an  incentive for free-riding, the absence of a supranational authority to enforce cooperative behaviour, and the need for widespread participation, negotiators are faced with the challenge of finding a burden-sharing scheme that is considered to be “fair” by a majority of governments (Ringius et al. 2002). Experimental evidence indicates that people are concerned about being fair to others and about others being fair to them. For example, contrary to theory, people make positive (although often suboptimal) contributions in public good games (Ledyard 1995).3   Dannenberg et al. (2010) consider whether climate negotiators have a personal preference for equity by measuring the inequity aversion of a sample of individuals involved in climate policy, using a multi-country (online) experiment. The authors find that participants are averse to both advantageous and disadvantageous inequality. Overall, the authors do not find inequity aversion to be correlated with nationality and conclude that equity preferences (within similar groups of people) are not greatly influenced by cultural circumstances.    Lange et al. (2007) analyse the importance of equity principles via an online survey of individuals of different nationalities who are involved in climate policy. While all participants consider equity in international climate negotiations to be important, participants from poorer countries place greater importance on the role of equity (relative to individuals from wealthier                                                           3 Fischbacher et al. (2001) and Fehr and Fischbacher (2004) find that cooperation reflects the norm of conditional cooperation which prescribes cooperation if group members cooperate and defection if group members defect. Laboratory experiments also provide evidence consistent with reciprocity, in which test subjects reward kind actions toward them and punish unkind actions (Brekke and Johansson-Stenman 2008, Gachter and Hermann 2009). In games with punishment opportunities, a number of authors have found that punishment increases as the differential between individual contributions and average group contributions widens (Fehr and Gächter 2000, Fehr and Gächter 2002, Anderson and Putterman 2006, Hofmeyr et al. 2008, Visser and Burns 2013). Univeristy of Cape Town 20  countries). In terms of preferences for specific equity principles, the authors find evidence of pure economic self-interest. Specifically, respondents from wealthier countries are less in favour of the polluter-pays and ability-to-pay rules (relative to poorer countries). In a subsequent paper, Lange et al. (2010) analyse respondents’ perceptions of the negotiating positions taken by the US, EU, G77/China and Russia. In particular, respondents are asked the extent to which each region is (in their opinion) expected to support each burden-sharing principle. Overall, the authors find the perceived support of equity principles by a particular region to be in line with economic self-interest. Specifically, the authors find that the cost rankings of the respective equity principles (ranking of financial cost of each equity principle for a particular region) are significantly (and negatively) related to their perceived support by the US, EU and Russia (there was no significant relationship for G77/China), signalling economic costs to be a major determinant of perceived use of equity principles by climate negotiators.   Carlsson et al. (2013) use a choice experiment to investigate preferences (willingness to pay) for various burden-sharing principles among individuals in the US and China. Overall, in line with self-interested use of burden-sharing principles, respondents are found to favour the rule that is least costly for their country.    The results reported in this article support the findings of both Lange et al. (2010) and Carlsson et al. (2013).   The design of the public good experiment reported here draws on the work of Milinski et al. (2008) and Tavoni et al. (2011) who both use threshold public good games to consider the social dilemma synonymous with climate change.   Milinski et al. consider whether a group of individuals are able to collectively reach a target through individual contributions when the whole group suffers when the target is not reached. The authors design a provision point (threshold) public good game where failure to reach the threshold is interpreted as failure to prevent dangerous climate change. Participants, who are each endowed with €40, can contribute either €0, €2 or €4 to the public good (framed a
