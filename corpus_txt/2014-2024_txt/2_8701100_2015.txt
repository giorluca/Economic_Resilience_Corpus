Gordeev, E-mail: vladimir.gordeev@lshtm.ac.ukABSTRACTBackground Despite extensive research on determinants of health, there is much less information on factors protecting health among thoseexposed to economic shocks. Using longitudinal data from the Russian Federation in the post-Soviet period, we examined individual-level factorsthat enhance resilience of health to economic shocks.Methods Logistic regression analysed factors associated with good self-assessed health (SAH) and health resilience, using pooled samples fromthe Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey-Higher School of Economics (1994–2012).Results The general population consistently reported ‘average’ SAH, indicating almost invariant trends over the years. Male gender was thestrongest predictor of good SAH and health resilience. Other factors positively associated with good SAH were age, higher education,employment, residing in rural areas, living in a larger and/or non-poor household. Among unemployed and those remaining unemployed, residingin rural areas, living in a larger and/or non-poor household remained the strongest predictors of good SAH and health resilience. These samefactors were also important for males with recent job loss.Conclusions Several factors predicting good SAH in the general population also influence health resilience factors among those remainingunemployed and experiencing a job loss. Such factors help to identify those most vulnerable and aid targeting assistance during economic crises.Keywords economic shock, health resilience, job loss, the Russian Federation, unemploymentIntroductionRecent years have seen increasing research on the impact ofeconomic crises on health.1–3 However, in every crisis, somegroups fare worse than others. The concept of resiliencerefers to the ability of an individual, household, community oran entire system to withstand the negative impact of the stres-sor (e.g. an economic crisis). Consequently, while much re-search on such crises has focussed on those who sufferadverse health effects, there are also some who, despitesimilar shocks, do not do so or even demonstrate positiveadaptation to adversity.4–6 Although, prima facie, it is likely thatresilience and vulnerability vary according to the physical, psy-chosocial and economic characteristics of those exposed tothe stressor, the concept of resilience varies across differentdisciplines so there is no single agreed deﬁnition.4,7 –11 Wehave been able to identify a study that attempted to create aframework for assessing resilience of health systems in aneconomic crisis.12 However, although there is extensive re-search on vulnerability within the literature on determinantsVladimir S.

Following the radical, market-oriented reform along the lines of ‘shock therapy’ startingfrom early 1990s, the economy of the Russian Federationexperienced several further economic crises (i.e. in 1998 and2008–2009, following the worldwide recession). One couldexpect that severe changes in the economy could directlyaffect a population’s health, making maintaining good healtha challenge. The unemployed, in particular, would beexpected to suffer the most during times of ﬁnancial hard-ships.15 – 18 The aim of our paper is to identify factors asso-ciated with health resilience in Russia since 1994, speciﬁcallyfocussing on those who remain unemployed and those wholose jobs.MethodsDataData were obtained from the Russia Longitudinal MonitoringSurvey-Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE).19 TheRLMS-HSE survey is a nationally representative surveydesigned to monitor the effects of Russian reforms on thehealth and economic welfare of households and individuals inthe Russian Federation. It uses face-to-face interviews; moredetails may be found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/rlms-hse. For the analysis, we used the individual- andhousehold-level data from Rounds 5–21 (1994–2012),although no rounds were conducted in 1997 and 1999. Datafrom Rounds 1–4 were sampled in a different way and areusually excluded from time series analyses. We used threesamples in this study. The ﬁrst sample includes all working-ageindividuals (deﬁned according to Russian legislation), aged16–60 years for males and 16–55 years for females(102 831 observations of 24 975 individuals) (Fig. 1). Usingthe panel structure of the data, the second and the thirdsamples were restricted to those individuals present in atleast two consecutive waves. The second is a pooled sampleof individuals who remained unemployed in two consecutiveyears (3789 observations, 1900 individuals). The rationalefor this sample is to identify the determinants of maintaininggood SAH (or even improve from bad to good SAH),despite experiencing the economic hardship of remainingunemployed. The third sample comprised individuals whowere employed in Year 1 but lost their job by Year 2 (3277observations, 2705 individuals). This sample provides infor-mation on the factors that enable individuals to be resilient,in terms of SAH, despite the shock of job loss.MeasuresSelf-assessed healthSAH is among the most frequently assessed global measureof health, widely used in epidemiological studies and has beenshown to predict mortality in diverse settings.20,21 In theRLMS-HSE data, SAH is measured using the question ‘Howwould you evaluate your health?’ on a ﬁve-point scale rangingfrom very bad, bad, average-not good, but not bad, good tovery good. We dichotomized the outcome variable into ‘good’(average, very good and good) and ‘bad’ SAH (very bad, bad),following previous studies with the RLMS-HSE22,23 andother Russian studies.24–26 We also constructed a variablemeasuring change in each individual’s SAH, based on the dif-ference in SAH in the current period (t), compared with thepreceding period (t2 1). Should SAH have improved frombad in t2 1 to good in period t, or remained good in both tand t2 1 periods, the outcome variable was set as equal to 1and otherwise 0.EmploymentAn individual was classiﬁed as being unemployed if theirpresent primary occupation was ‘temporarily not employedfor other reasons (other than being student, health sickness,maternity leave retirement, etc.) and looking for a job’, as for-mulated in the questionnaire. Following the ofﬁcial deﬁnitionof unemployment by International Labour Organization,27this category excluded economically inactive individuals, i.e.those currently unemployed, but not looking for work. Thoseexperiencing job loss and who remained unemployed duringconsecutive years t 2 1 and t were identiﬁed.Individuals aged 16and older (nobs = 102 831)Employed(nobs = 90 148)Unemployed(nobs = 12 683)Remain unemployed next year(nobs = 3779)Job loss next year(nobs = 3277)Gain job next year (2 years)(nobs = 3627)Remain employed next year(nobs = 59 150)Fig. 1 Overview of the samples.

Education wasdichotomized into two categories: high (higher level education)and middle–low (complete secondary and incomplete second-ary or primary). Area of residence was dichotomized intourban (regional centre, city and a category termed qpsgmpldprpeslpdp tjqa, meaning semi-rural settlement but withaccess to urban facilities) and rural. Household size capturedthe number of dwellers in each household. An asset score anda poverty measure captured the material and ﬁnancial well-being of the household. The asset score was derived bysumming a number of selected household goods (car, washingmachine, videotape recorder, refrigerator, dacha—a countrycottage or allotment) that loaded onto a single factor using theprincipal component analysis and formed a single continuousvariable (0–5). This measure is similar to that used by Perlmanand Bobak,23 with a refrigerator replacing a colour television.Each household belonged to one of ﬁve all-Russian povertycategories (with the 5th being the richest) as deﬁned by Popkinet al.28 Prior to the analysis, the bivariate correlation betweenthe asset score indicator and the poverty groups indicator wasmeasured and found to be small (Pearson’s correlation coefﬁ-cient ,0.3). This allowed us to use both variables in the regres-sion analysis, avoiding the possible multicollinearity problem.The socioeconomic characteristics of the samples are summar-ized in Table 1. Respondents were classiﬁed as current smokersor non-smokers (either ex-smokers or never-smokers). Thereported quantities of consumed alcohol within the last 30 days(beer, wine, fortiﬁed wine, vodka or home-distilled spirits) wereconverted into grams of pure alcohol based on conversionfactors used in previous studies.29,30 We used the WHO deﬁn-ition of episodic heavy drinking as consuming .60 g of purealcohol per drinking session31 to identify heavy drinkers.AnalysesTo measure health resilience, we adapted the following deﬁn-ition: ‘Resilience is the capability of individuals and systemsTable 1 Distribution of variables among working-age respondents aged 16 and over (up to 55 years for women, 60 years for men)Characteristics 1994 2000 2006 2012Individual levelAge (years), mean+SD 37.32+10.24 37.1+10.47 37.09+10.79 37.89+10.59Female 16–60 (n, %) 2169 (46.5) 2225 (48.5) 3127 (48.2) 4461 (47.7)Male 16–55 (n, %) 2491 (53.5) 2362 (51.5) 3361 (51.8) 4885 (52.3)EducationMiddle and low (n, %) 3690 (79.2) 3704 (80.7) 4980 (76.8) 6594 (70.6)High (n, %) 970 (20.8) 883 (19.3) 1507 (23.2) 2752 (29.4)Unemployed, yes (n, %) 567 (12.2) 732 (16) 829 (12.8) 822 (8.8)SAH, mean+ SD 3.23+0.64 3.29+0.64 3.34+0.61 3.44+0.6SAHGood (average to very good) (n, %) 4266 (91.5) 4268 (93) 6177 (95.2) 9039 (96.7)Bad (very bad to bad) (n, %) 394 (8.5) 319 (7) 311 (4.8) 3073.3 (3.3)Rural, yes (n, %) 1048 (22.5) 1237 (27) 1667 (25.7) 2245 (24)Household levelHousehold size, mean+ SD 3.58+1.32 3.56+1.45 3.5+1.48 3.54+1.54Income per capita, rubles, mean+SD 5224.55+6347.15 3706.9+4583.68 7675.48+9442.15 11 074.22+16 706.3Asset score, mean+ SD 2.56+1.05 2.88+1.18 3.50+1.35 3.54+1.51Poverty groupsPoverty Group 1 (most poor) (n, %) 762 (16.3%) 805 (17.5%) 211 (3.3%) 77 (0.8%)Poverty Group 2 (n, %) 1221 (28.6%) 1233 (26.9%) 471 (7.3%) 159 (1.7%)Poverty Group 3 (n, %) 946 (20.3%) 972 (21.2%) 746 (11.5%) 322 (3.5%)Poverty Group 4 (n, %) 615 (13.2%) 660 (14.4%) 891 (13.7%) 711 (7.6%)Poverty Group 5 (most rich) (n, %) 1005 (21.6%) 917 (20.0%) 4167 (64.2%) 8077 (86.4%)n respondents 4660 4587 6488 9346The data for 1997 and 1999 are not available.Source: Author’s analysis of data from RLMS-HSE.ECONOMIC SHOCKS AND HEALTH RESILIENCE 3 by guest on November 19, 2015http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from (families, groups and communities) to cope successfully inthe face of signiﬁcant adversity or risk. This capability devel-ops and changes over time, is enhanced by protective factorswithin the individual/system and the environment and contri-butes to the maintenance or enhancement of health’.32Applying this deﬁnition to health resilience, we deﬁned indivi-duals as being resilient if their SAH either did not deteriorateor improve despite experiencing a shock or prolonged hard-ship (losing their job or being unemployed). The relationshipbetween the outcome and independent variables that couldpotentially enhance or diminish individual’s health resiliencewas assessed by means of descriptive and regression analyses,using STATA 14. In our analysis, we used the followingmodel:logit fprob ðSAHij ¼ 1Þg ¼ b0 þ b1SESij þ r ;whereSESij is a vector of demographic and socio-demographic vari-ables (gender, age, age2, age3, education level, area of resi-dence, household size, household asset score and householdpoverty group); b0 is the constant term; b1 is a vector of para-meters of interest; r is the error term. Several competingmodels were estimated to identify determinants of SAH. Thebest-ﬁtting models were selected and are presented in theResults section.ResultsFigure 2 shows trends in mean SAH over time for the generalpopulation, stratiﬁed by employment and gender. Overall,SAH improved over the study period (1994–2012) amongthose employed, for both genders, particularly from 2001onwards. The mean values of SAH are higher among bothemployed and unemployed males than among women.Additional analysis (not shown) revealed that over the last twodecades 55–60% of individuals in the general populationconsistently reported ‘average’ SAH, with almost invarianttrends over the years.Table 2 (part A) presents the results of the logistic regres-sion of determinants of good SAH in the general population.Among males, good health was positively associated with age,being better educated, being employed, living in a largerhousehold, a non-poor one and residing in a rural area.Among females, the pattern was similar, except that signiﬁ-cantly better health began to be seen at lower poverty levels.When restricting the sample to those unemployed (Table 2,part B), among males, only living in a rural area and in awealthier household were signiﬁcantly associated with betterhealth. Among females, age, residing in a rural area, living in alarger and wealthiest household were signiﬁcant.We now move from the static determinants of health tolook at the determinants of health resilience (maintaining orimproving SAH). Table 3 shows the change in SAH overconsecutive waves in males and females who remain in em-ployment, remain unemployed, gain employment or lose em-ployment. We then look at the factors associated with healthresilience in individuals who remained unemployed and thusexperienced continuing economic hardship (Table 4 part A).Among males, the only signiﬁcant factors were larger house-hold size and not being among the poorest group. In females,the only factor was larger household size. When looking atthe determinants of health resilience among individuals whoexperienced job loss (Table 4 part B), no factors were signiﬁ-cant in females but, among males, living in a larger householdand residing in a rural area were signiﬁcantly associated withpersistent good or improving health. The association ofsmoking and heavy drinking with SAH in both models wasinsigniﬁcant in both sexes (at P  0.05 level).DiscussionMain findings of this studyWe began by looking at changes in SAH over the last twodecades in the Russian Federation, subsequently exploring thedeterminants of good health and resilience to prolongedhardship and economic shocks.

The data for 1997 and1999 are not available. The mean SAH among those unemployed seems tobe higher compared with their employed counterparts, although in mostperiods the difference is not significant. This is most likely, because they areyounger.

Male gender wasthe strongest predictor of good SAH. Other predictors ofgood SAH were age, employment status, living in larger andwealthier (non-poor) households, as well as having a higherlevel of education. Among the unemployed, living in largerhouseholds remained important when reporting good SAH,as did residing in a rural area.Our results show that over the last two decades, most in-dividuals in the general population consistently reported‘average’ SAH, indicating almost invariant trends over theyears. Thus, it seems that reporting SAH as ‘average’, ratherthan ‘good’ or ‘very good’, became a widely accepted norm inRussian society. The dominance of ‘average’ levels of SAHreported by individuals is unsurprising and is consistent withprevious observations in the 1990s when few men or womenin most former communist countries reported good SAH(compared with their Western European counterparts), withRussians reporting among the worst SAH levels, alongsidethose in Belarus and Hungary.22,33What this study addsOne of the clearest ﬁndings is that both unemployed andemployed women continue to report worse SAH than theirmale counterparts do. This is in line with all previous ﬁndingson SAH in Russia and studies in other countries.34,35 This hasbeen linked to selective survival, as there is little differencebetween healthy life expectancy in Russian men and women,35,36but there may also be some difference in SAH between men andwomen in Russia. Our study focussed solely on the working-agepopulation, excluding pensioners. Consequently, it was not pos-sible to compare our results with an earlier study37 that showedhow, even though women tended to report poorer health thanmen up to middle age, men between 45 and 59 years oldreported the same overall health status as women, graduallylosing their initial advantage and reporting the worst healthstatus as pensioners.37 Nicholson et al.25 also showed in a cross-sectional study among those aged 50 and over that SAH in olderRussians reﬂects social exposures accumulated over the lifecourse, with the differentials observed only partially explained bycurrent social conditions. In an age-adjusted analysis, good SAHwas associated with high contemporary social class, income andeducation in both genders and, for men, not being widowed.25This once again underlines the necessity to account for thechanging perception of the SAH construct by individuals overthe life span, as well as the age gradient among different genders.However, as noted above, it is also important to consider thepersisting wide gender gap in the life expectancy, with oldermales being ‘survivors’.Table2ContinuedGoodhealthBothgendersFemaleMalesOR95%CIP.zOR95%CIP.zOR95%CIP.zPovertyGroup41.1310.804–1.5900.4801.1160.662–1.8810.6811.1020.699–1.7370.675PovertyGroup5(richest)1.4121.060–1.8800.0181.5821.013–2.4710.0441.2740.871–1.8630.212nobs¼12683;nind¼6604nobs¼5357;nind¼3019nobs¼7326;nind¼3585Thedatafor1997and1999arenotavailable.Forallmodels,Prob.x2¼0.000.Source:Author’sanalysisofdatafromRLMS-HSE.6 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH by guest on November 19, 2015http://jpubhealth.oxfordjournals.org/Downloaded from Employment, education and household material well-beingwere among other predictors of SAH, consistent with studiesconducted in other countries.15–18,34,38–42 Higher educationwas associated with better SAH in the general population, butnot among the unemployed. This is in line with previous ﬁnd-ings that ﬁnd that the level of education or educational capitalcould22,23,25,43,44 or could not be20,35,45 associated with betterSAH in the Russian population. Indicators of poverty andasset scores were associated with good SAH. Previous studiesshowed that personal income, family income and material de-privation are among the strongest individual predictors ofSAH in Russia,22,23,25,35,44 as well as other indicators of eco-nomic circumstances (economic difﬁculties during childhood,number economic difﬁculties during the past 12 months,changes in material well-being over 10 years).20Residing in a rural area was another important factor asso-ciated with positive SAH (particularly among males), and thisassociation appears stronger in the continually unemployedsample. We hypothesize that this is potentially due to the pres-ence of a stronger informal social support network in ruralareas, a higher level of social capital, somewhat less stressfulliving environment, as well as reliance on natural production(growing and storing own crops, gathering and foraging).However, the lack of relevant data in the RLMS-HSE datasetprecludes testing these assumptions but these issues could beexplored in future studies.Living in larger households was protective, even after con-trolling for gender, education and wealth. This is consistentwith studies showing that being married, as well as havingchildren in the family act as protective factors for physicalhealth34 and mental health (stress levels and happiness).46,47It could be that, in larger families, people tend to report betterSAH regardless of their employment status or other socio-economic characteristics, due to greater social cohesion,support and feelings of security. However, we were unable totest this assumption.What is already known on this topicThe potential importance of social and human capital andincome inequalities is supported by earlier studies suggestingthat they could have a strong compositional effects on SAH,with contextual country speciﬁc measures possibly moderat-ing the effect of compositional measures on SAH.35,48,49Social capital elements (e.g. contact with neighbours; being amember of a trade union or a political organization or anyother organization; social exclusion; reliance on anti-modern,market, informal networks) have been shown to be positivelyassociated with good SAH.20,35,43 The contribution of socialcapital outside the family (e.g. visiting friends and acquain-tances, membership of voluntary associations) to SAH seemsto be particularly important for men, proving once again thenecessity to account for different gender roles, socializing pat-terns, and the values embedded within them, in the Russian(and not only) society, since social capital provides access todifferent forms of resources, inﬂuences and support, but alsoimposes different obligations.50 Therefore, the concepts ofsocial and human capital could be important in better under-standing health resilience and should be included in futurestudies, subject to availability of such data.Limitations of this studyThe limitations of this study are those common to any usingself-reported and panel data: reporting bias; attrition in the in-dividual and household longitudinal constituents reducingsample size of unemployed individuals, less precise modelparameter estimations and reduced power; short recall periodof 30 days (income, employment and SAH); data beingTable 3 Change in SAH over consecutive waves in males and females who remain in employment, remain unemployed, gain employment or looseemploymentSelf-perceived health, mean+SDTime period t t þ 1 t t þ 1 t t þ 1Group Women Men OverallEmployed in t and t þ 1 3.23+0.59 3.23+0.57 3.42+0.59 3.41+0.59 3.33+0.59 3.32+0.59Unemployed in t and t þ 1 3.36+0.67 3.34+0.68 3.46+0.69 3.45+0.69 3.42+0.68 3.41+0.69Employed in t, unemployed in t þ 1 3.27+0.63 3.26+0.64 3.47+0.65 3.42+0.64 3.40+0.65 3.36+0.65Unemployed in t, employed in t þ 1 3.31+0.64 3.34+0.59 3.50+0.65 3.49+0.64 3.42+0.65 3.43+0.63See comments beneath Fig. 2.Source: Author’s analysis of data from RLMS-HSE.

Another limita-tion of our study is that we could not ascertain causal relation-ships given the study design.ConclusionsWe showed that several factors predicting good SAH in thegeneral population also inﬂuence health resilience factorsamong those remaining unemployed and those who experiencejob loss. Such factors help to identify those most vulnerableand aid targeting assistance during economic crises. However,identifying factors that help individuals remain healthy despiteadversity and shocks is only half the task. What remains to bestudied are the exact mechanisms that underpin resilience,using both quantitative and qualitative data. This could beexplored further using other longitudinal datasets (e.g. theGerman Socio-Economic Panel51 and the UK UnderstandingSociety Study),52 especially due to recurrent nature of recenteconomic crises. The next step, should the data be available,is to explore casual relationships between shocks and adver-sity, factors promoting resilience, and SAH, which wouldstrengthen evidence that can be translated into policy.Authors’ contributionsV.S.G. drafted the paper together with input from Y.G., D.S.,M.M. and B.R.
