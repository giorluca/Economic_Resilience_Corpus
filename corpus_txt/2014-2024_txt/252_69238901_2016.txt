ABSTRACT OF THESIS 
 
 
TECHNO-ECONOMIC POTENTIAL OF ENHANCED COAL 
RECOVERY THROUGH MIDDLINGS LIBERATION AND RE-
PROCESSING 
  
The typical preparation plant producing coal for the utility market targets a relative 
separation density in the plant of around 1.60 whereas plants generating metallurgical coal 
use relative cut point density values approaching 1.50. In some cases, achieving the 
specified coal quality requires operating at lower cut point values, which results in a 
significant loss of valuable coal. In these situations, a middlings stream can be produced 
using a secondary separator or a three-product unit, which would allow crushing of the 
middlings for liberation purposes and re-introduction into the plant feed. In this manner, 
higher quality coal can be produced while maximizing plant yield.  
A detailed laboratory analysis was conducted to study the liberation characteristics 
resulting from the crushing of middlings at different top sizes. The experimental data were 
later used as input for modeling and simulation of plant flowsheet in LIMN. Simulations 
were run for several regrinding cases. The results of the current study investigating the 
economic benefits of middlings liberation and re-treatment are presented and discussed in 
this thesis. Improvement up to 6% in plant yield with 16-21% reduction in ash and 14-18% 
sulfur reductions can be achieved by crushing the +1/2 inch middlings to a ½-inch top size.  
KEYWORDS: Middlings, cut point, three-product separator, liberation, LIMN, Modeling

1  Introduction 
1.1 Background 
The typical coal preparation plants of United States use relative cut point density values 
approaching 1.60. However, the Illinois Basin coal plants are often required to operate at 
lower density cut points below a 1.5 relative density value to provide clean coal with low 
sulfur content. For a two product separator, a low density separation often results in a 
substantial loss of valuable coal. Introducing a three-product separator would allow the 
capture of such middlings which could be further retreated to ensure maximum recovery 
of valuable coal.  
Coal Deposits 
The coal-bearing regions of the U.S. are divided into three main areas: Appalachia Basin, 
Illinois Basin and Powder River Basin. Powder River Basin has the biggest reserves in the 
U.S. followed by the Illinois Basin.  Figure 1.1 shows the major coal basins of the U.S. 
This research project was performed using coal from the Dotiki Mining Complex operated 
by Alliance Resource Partner, LP located in Western Kentucky which extracts coal from 
the Kentucky No. 13 seam in the Illinois Basin.  The Illinois Basin extends over an area of 
approximately 53,000 sq. miles in East Central United States.  It encompasses a large 
portion of Illinois and extends up to Southwestern Indiana and Western Kentucky. This 
basin is one of the oldest coal producing regions in the U.S. dating back to early 1800s. 
The Illinois basin has an estimated reserve of 50 billion tons of recoverable coal, making 
it the second largest basin in the country only behind the massive Powder River Basin, 
which has nearly 115 billion tons of coal. The coal found in Illinois Basin is medium and 
high volatile Bituminous coal reserves of Pennsylvanian age rocks. The coal reserve is 
characterized by its high sulfur content and has inherent moisture in the range of 7-9%.  
The occurrence of ash is irregular and unpredictable for large areas of the individual coal 
seams. The ash content of Illinois coals lies in the range of 6%- 14%. The average ash 
content of Illinois coals is about 10%, with variations in the order of 2 to 3%. The heat 
content of Illinois coals ranges from about 11,000 Btu/lb. on moisture, mineral-matter-free 
basis in the northwestern part of the basin to about 15,000 Btu/lb. in the southeastern part. 
2 
 
The average heat content of coal ranges from 10,000 -12,500 Btu/lb.  The high heat content 
of the coal is often offset by the loss in value due to the high-sulfur content. 
High Sulfur Content 
As per the EPA’s emissions control standard, Illinois Basin coal is classified as a high 
sulfur coal. Total sulfur content of Illinois coals ranges from as low as 0.5% to more than 
8%. Sulfur content of the coal depends on the type of overburden. Most of the coals that 
have marine shales and carbonates, as overburden tend to have higher sulfur content, 
greater than 2.5 percent. Whereas, the coals having non marine gray shales as the roof rocks 
contain less than 2.5 percent sulfur. The presence of marine shales and limestones in the 
overburden rocks accounts for the high sulfur content of the Illinois Basin coals.

1.2 Problem Statement 
As opposed to the regular trends of cutting at 1.6 medium density, the Illinois basin plants 
have to cut at 1.5 medium density to cut down the high sulfur content of the coal. This low 
density separation negatively affects their yield and result in significant loss of valuable 
coal.  
With the growing EPA’s regulations, it becomes necessary to reduce the sulfur content of 
the coal. The reduction of high sulfur percentages in coal is a difficult problem. The sulfur 
content of the Illinois Basin coals is mostly in the form of pyritic and organic sulfur. 
Organic sulfur is part of the coal structure and uniformly distributed throughout the coal. 
It is practically not possible to remove the organic sulfur by physical cleaning processes. 
Whereas, pyritic sulfur occurs as discrete particles within the coal structure and can be 
removed by physical cleaning if properly liberated. The extent of reduction of pyritic sulfur 
is a function of particle size reduction. Sometimes the pyritic sulfur may be intricately 
mixed within the coal matrix. Such coal will require crushing up to fine sizes to liberate 
the pyritic sulfur. The coal-sulfur distribution in the coal matrix can be so interwoven that 
the coal is essentially required to be crushed to small sizes for affecting liberation of coal 
and sulfur particles. It is well known that the fine coal beneficiation processes are generally 
less efficient than the coarse beneficiation processes. In addition, the handling and 
transportation of finer products become difficult and expensive. Thus, it is imperative to 
find an optimum top size for crushing the coal, which would liberate the sulfur and 
simultaneously maximizes the recovery of clean coal in beneficiation processes. 
1.3 Scope of Work 
To conduct the study, the Dotiki plant operated by Alliance coal was selected. Alliance 
coal facilitated to conduct a test at Dotiki plant by setting the medium density at 1.35. 
Samples around the entire plant were collected. The coarse reject sample was sent to SGS 
Minerals laboratory to achieve a cut at 1.8 specific gravity medium. Thus, a middlings 
fraction having specific gravity of 1.35 - 1.8 was obtained. High specific gravity (1.8 sink) 
coal was the final reject. The middlings fraction was used for further experiment and 
analysis.

The major objective of this research project is to reduce the sulfur and ash content while 
maximizing the recovery of clean coal produced from the Dotiki preparation plant. This 
project aims at improve the product quality while positively impacting the plant yield. This 
research aimed to evaluate the response of middlings fraction to regrinding. To achieve the 
project goals, the following specific objectives were targeted: 
(i) Introduction of a middlings stream using a secondary dense media cyclone or a 
three-product unit in the Dotiki coal preparation plant. 
(ii) Particle size analysis of the middlings produced and evaluation of the 
washability characteristics of various middling size fractions. 
(iii) Cushing of the middlings for liberation purposes at various top sizes using a 
laboratory scale hammer mill. 
(iv) Particle size analysis of the middlings after being crushed to different top sizes 
and subsequent washability studies. 
(v) Designing a new flowsheet with a regrinding circuit. 
(vi) Modelling and simulation of the base case and proposed flowsheets using 
LIMN- an Excel-hosted flowsheet processor.

(vii) Efficiency evaluation of the regrinding circuit and of the overall preparation 
plant. 
(viii) Technical and economic analysis of the proposed design. 
 
1.4 Organization of the Thesis 
The thesis is divided into six main chapters. Chapter 1 provides the background leading to 
the research. It also discusses the purpose of the project. Chapter 2 is focused on the 
literature review and discusses the previous attempts done in the field of regrinding and 
sulfur reduction. Chapter 3 discusses the Dotiki preparation plant. Chapter 4 focuses on the 
experiments done at laboratory of the Department of Mining Engineering, University of 
Kentucky. Chapter 5 discusses the Modelling and simulation using LIMN. Chapter 6 
discusses the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed design. Finally, chapter 7 
summarizes the results and conclusions.

2 Literature Review  
 
2.1 Middlings 
For a typical coal washability, the intermediate specific gravity fractions have high ash and 
sulfur content. The low-density fractions comprise the clean coal whereas high-density 
material is reject. The intermediate density material is called middling. The coal middlings 
have a relatively high ash content because of associated pyrites and minerals. The 
middlings consist of large amount of unlocked material. It consists of pyrite rocks blended 
with coal. Degree of locking of pyrites within coal matrix varies largely within the coal of 
different regions. 
Tables 2.1 and 2.2 show the typical washability data of Illinois No. 6 coal for a coarser (1 
x ½ inch) fraction and a finer (6 x 1 mm) size fraction.  
Table 2-1 Washability data for 1 x 1/2 inch (coarse) Illinois No. 6 coal used in study

1.70 - 38.64 82.73 5.88 
 
These two tables indicate that, as the particle size decreases within the same Illinois No. 6 
coal, the sulfur values decrease significantly for the intermediate specific gravity fractions, 
while their incremental ashes remain the same. This is due to the reduction in pyritic sulfur 
caused by liberation due to finer sizes, even without any crushing. This forms a basis that 
crushing the middlings to a finer size would result in the liberation of sulfur.

2.2 Middlings Liberation Characteristics 
Middlings are relatively high ash materials whose subsequent liberation is possible through 
size reduction. However, liberation of middlings depends on type of comminution devices 
and fragmentation mechanisms (Weining Xie, 2013). Middlings particles of size 3 x 0.5 
mm from a dense medium cyclone were crushed using by jaw crusher and ball mill to 
−0.5 mm to generate similar particle size distribution. The particles crushed by jaw crusher 
showed better mineral liberation than that by the ball mill for each size fraction. For a target 
ash of 11%, jaw crusher produced 20% higher yields.  
 The breakage characteristics of middlings and their liberation properties depends on the 
distribution of mineral matter within the coal. Oliver (1995) crushed middlings from a 
dense medium separator using a swing hammer crusher. According to the investigation, 
the original uncrushed middlings did not show any liberation with reducing particle size. 
However, crushing improved the liberation characteristics of the middlings. It is believed 
that the change in liberation of the crushed products as a whole is due to the difference in 
size distributions. 
2.3 Previous Attempts at Ash and Sulfur Reduction 
Deurbrouck et al. (1966) did a survey of sulfur reduction in Appalachian coals resulting 
from staged crushing. The investigations indicated that Appalachian coals showed 
significant sulfur reductions when crushed to a top size of 14 Mesh. A feasible approach 
for sulfur reductions could be liberation of pyritic sulfur by crushing and subsequent 
removal by density separation. The study involved crushing of the entire sample to 1 – ½ 
inch top size before testing. Then the samples were stage crushed through 3/8 inch and 14 
Mesh. And in another series of tests, the samples were crushed to 3/8-inch top size only. 
Crushing of samples to 1 – ½ and 3/8 inch did not indicate any significant sulfur reduction 
in 1.6 S.G. float. However, the stage crushing of samples to 1- ½ inch, 3/8 inch and 14 
Mesh exhibited substantial sulfur reductions in 1.6 S.G. float, especially when crushed 
down to 14 Mesh top size. Moreover, significant sulfur reductions in the Upper Kittanning 
coalbed at each successive stage of crushing were observed. On the contrary, the Lower 
Kittanning coalbed did not show any sulfur liberations by crushing. Another finding of this 
10 
 
survey was the constant sulfur content of 1.3 S.G. float regardless of the crushing stage. 
However, the stage crushing increased the amount of material recovered in 1.3 S.G. float. 
Perez (1988) studied the various modes of liberation in the coal-ash-pyrite matrix. The 
studies showed that the mode of breakage is influenced mainly by the nature of the feed, 
type of comminution device and their modes of operation. Crushing of raw coal and 
middlings particles with rotary breaker, jaw crusher, rolls, hammer mill and rod mill 
indicated different modes of breakage of particles. Breakage of particles in coal occurs 
primarily by detachment.  It is usually desirable to achieve liberation at a coarse particle 
size. This could be achieved by taking the advantages of inherent zones of weakness 
between minerals grains and by selecting appropriate comminution device designed to 
accentuate fracture at the weakness zones.  
2.4 Previous Attempts at Middlings Liberation 
Several researchers have worked on regrinding and re-treatment of coal middlings to 
extract maximum valuables out of the coal to increase the recovery.  
Perez (1986) developed a simple negative exponential model to describe the liberation of 
coal and pyrite out of various raw coals and beneficiated fractions using different crushing 
devices. The study is based on the use of five milling devices: smooth crushing rolls, 
hammer mill, rod mill, jaw crusher and Mikro – Sampl mill. Liberation studies were 
conducted on raw coal and middlings. The simple exponential model developed could be 
used to evaluate the additional coal recovery achieved by recrushing of middlings. The 
experiments indicated better liberation with finer crusher product discharge.  
Claasen (1980) did extensive studies on coking coals of Soutpansberg area in South Africa 
for maximum recovery routes through middlings treatment. His work indicated that the 
middlings crushed to 0.8 mm can liberate 2% of run-of-coal at 12% ash. However, crushing 
the middlings down to 0.21 mm was required to liberate 3.6% of run – of – coal at 12% 
ash.  Thus, a much finer grind was required for substantial liberation purposes. Grinding 
middlings to finer sizes for liberation purposes generated micro-fines. The micro fines 
produced could be recovered successfully through froth flotation. The positive response of 
the micro fines to the froth floatation was however, disparaged by the high moisture 
11 
 
retention of micro fines. The loss of fines in the coke-making process from micro fines was 
another major concern.  
Tests programs have been conducted at EPRI Coal Quality Development Center, 
Pennsylvania to crush the coal to liberate the ash and sulfur. With the increasing 
environmental regulations, the utility market is willing to pay the premiums for lower 
sulfur coal (Parkinson, 1985). The studies were done to compare the liberation 
improvements resulting from crushing of all the raw coal versus middlings crushing. Raw 
coals and middlings were subjected to five stages of crushing: 6 inch, 1 – ½ inch, 0.6 mm, 
0.15 mm and 0.053 mm.  Interestingly, at the same energy recovery, the staged middlings 
crushing approach resulted in 55% SO2 reduction as compared to the conventional 
cleaning case, which gives 31% SO2 reduction from raw coal. However, crushing of all 
the raw coal to small sizes such as 0.6 mm for liberation purposes is not economically 
viable. The utility market cannot support the cost of such fine crushing because of extensive 
power requirements in crushing. Further, the processes to beneficiate the finer size coals 
are less efficient and also fine coal transportations are more difficult and expensive. 
Therefore, crushing only middlings, instead of crushing the entire raw coal presents more 
judicious solution to liberate sulfur and ash while improving yields.  
The Ohio Coal testing and Development Research Facility (OCTAD), 1992, has 
experimented on capturing of middlings and their subsequent crushing and retreatment. 
The test aimed to remove sulfur and ash from Ohio coals. Tests were conducted on the 
Meigs Creek Seam Coal. The studies involved different circuitry arrangement to produce 
coarse and intermediate size fractions middlings. A total of twelve different flowsheet 
configurations were investigated to compare the results with conventional coal preparation 
circuits. All the twelve flowsheets used the similar cleaning circuit for +28 Mesh size 
fraction. Twelve different circuit configurations for cleaning the fine coal (28M x 0) were 
discussed. Different combinations of heavy media cyclone and froth flotation were 
employed. Further, the recirculating medium densities and reagent dosages of flotation 
were also varied. The circuitry arrangement with fine heavy media cyclone to treat 28M x 
150M size fractions showed best performance for SO2 reductions and recovery 
12 
 
improvements. Tests conducted showed significant SO2 reductions of around 127% with a 
decrease of 17% in energy recovery as compared to existing commercial plants.  
2.5 Problem Being Addressed 
The HGI of Illinois basin coal is around 50-60, which is considered as a hard coal. The 
Illinois No. 6 coal used for this study is not a friable coal which will likely result in 
minimizing fines production when crushing for liberation purposes.  
2.6 Three Product DMC to Capture Middlings 
Guohua Technology Corporation (GTC) is a commercial manufacturer of three product 
DMC. The GTC cyclone is a gravity fed cyclone. It can be successfully applied to treat 
coal with particle size less than 110 mm. 
The GTC three-product cyclone consists of two vessels in series. Figure 2.1 represents a 
schematic diagram of the GTC three product dense medium cyclone.  There is a cylindrical 
vessel for the primary stage of separation at a relatively low density while, a conical 
cyclone is used for secondary stage of separation at a higher density There are three 
discharge openings for clean coal, middlings and refuse, respectively. The use of 
cylindrical vessel for primary separation facilitates homogeneous and stable media. The 
use a conical cyclone in secondary stage assists in an increase in the actual separation 
density which in turn minimizes the misplacement of middlings into refuse. 
13 
 
 
Figure 2-1: GTC Three Product DMC 
 As opposed to the conventional heavy media cyclones, the raw coal and heavy media are 
fed separately into the three-product dense medium cyclone. The medium tangentially 
enters the first stage cyclone under desired head pressure. The raw coal is fed from the top 
under gravity. The lighter clean coal moves towards the central air core under the influence 
of centrifugal force and discharged through the bottom of the cylindrical vessel. The heavy 
media entering the second stage cyclone is already concentrated and thickened due to the 
action of centrifugal force in the first stage. The secondary cyclone operates at a higher 
separation density as compared to the primary cyclone to produce middlings and reject. 
The GTC three product DMC offers several advantages over conventional dense medium 
cyclone. As opposed to the conventional approach where coal-media mixture is pumped to 
the DMC, the gravity feeding approach of the GTC cyclones significantly reduces size 
degradation, power consumption, and mechanical wearing of the cyclone parts. Moreover, 
the GTC cyclones are equipped with device for online adjustment of separation density of 
the secondary stage. This can be achieved by varying the depth of the vortex finder. 
Another advantage of the GTC cyclones is the cylindrical primary vessel which increases 
the particle retention time thus, resulting in a cleaner product.

The coal samples were collected from the Dotiki coal preparation plant located in Western 
Kentucky.  Alliance Resource Partner, LP operates the Dotiki Plant. This coal reserve falls 
in Illinois Basin, which is characterized by high sulfur content. The Dotiki coal preparation 
plant utilizes a standard 48-inch Krebs dense media cyclone to beneficiate the coarse coal 
(+ 18 Mesh) and the fine beneficiation (18 x 100 Mesh) uses water only cyclone and spiral 
circuit. While the ultra-fine coal (-100 Mesh) is treated using froth flotation. The dense 
media cyclone is a two-product system producing clean coal and rejects. The plant uses a 
circulating medium density of 1.5. The plant yield ranges between 46 – 50 %. The prep 
plant is losing significant amount of valuable coal due to low separation densities. The high 
sulfur content of the coal is another big problem. However, fine generation is not an issue 
with the Illinois basin coal as it is a hard coal with HGI in the range of 50-60. 
The typical monthly average plant performance of the Dotiki preparation plant is shown 
on table 3.1. As shown in table 3.1, the average plant yield ranges between 46-50%. The 
typical ash content of the clean coal is 10-11%.

4 Experimental Work 
 
4.1 Experimental Methods and Equipment 
The experimental work has been divided into the following three sections: 
1. Collection and characterization of middling fraction 
2. Crushing of Middlings to different top sizes 
3. Float and sink analysis of crushed middlings to study the liberation 
 4.1.1 Collection of Sample 
Alliance plant facilitated to conduct a test at Dotiki Plant by setting the cut density at 1.35 
for 3 hours. Samples were collected around the entire plant every 20 minutes for 3 hours. 
Samples of feed, clean coal, coarse reject, fine reject and thickener underflow were 
collected. DMC circuit sampling was conducted every 20 minutes over a period of 3 hours. 
DMC samples were collected by the stop belt method.  Feed, clean coal and reject samples 
were taken simultaneously by the stop belt method. Six barrels of coarse DMC reject was 
collected. Incremental sampling method was used to collect the samples of thickener 
underflow.

Figure 4-1: Sample collection from clean coal product of Dense Medium Cyclone 
 
The Table 4.1 shows the plant performance on the day of sample collection. The above 
table indicates that while cutting at a medium density of 1.35, the Dotiki plant produced a 
yield of 38.44%. The ash content of the clean coal was 8.22% and sulfur content was 
3.15%.

The Dotiki plant currently has a two-product Dense Media cyclone for coarse coal 
beneficiation. The existing DMC produces clean coal and rejects. The coarse reject coal 
sample was sent to SGS Minerals laboratory achieve a cut at 1.8. Middlings were generated 
by preparing a float-sink analysis of the reject material using a medium of 1.8 Specific 
gravity. A middlings fraction having specific gravity of 1.35 x 1.8 was generated. High 
specific gravity (1.8 sink) coal was the final reject. The middlings fraction (1.35 x 1.8 SG) 
was used for further testing and analysis in the laboratory of the Department of Mining 
Engineering, University of Kentucky.  
4.1.2 Sampling of Material 
After receiving the middlings coal samples at the laboratory, a representative sample was 
obtained from the bulk sample using coning and quartering method. The success of any 
experiment depends on the accuracy of sampling. Sampling is a very important procedure 
from the very beginning of any experiment. Sampling is a technique used to obtain 
representative samples that will show the characteristics of the bulk material and it must 
be done with extreme precautions. The sample size obtained from the plant is often larger 
than as required for the test procedures in the laboratory. Samples must be reduced in a 
manner that it reproduces the properties of the original sample.  It is often difficult to obtain 
a representative sample of raw coal at a top size of plus 75 mm. To achieve this, coning 
and quartering method was used. It involved making conical heaps of the sample on a clean 
floor, and then flattening it out with the help of shovel. The flattened sample was divided 
into four zones; the two opposite quarters were discarded, while the other two quarters 
were combined to form the reduced sample. The same process is repeated until an 
appropriate sample size is obtained. The final sample left behind is used for further 
analyses.

4.1.3 Washability Analysis of Uncrushed Middlings 
After obtaining the sample of appropriate size, a particle size analysis was done using 
screens of following apertures: 1 inch, ½ inch and ¼ inch. The screening was done 
manually with hand screens. This was done to avoid the undesirable breakage of coals 
which may occur in case of mechanical screening. Following the screening, each size 
fraction was weighed. The weight of each size fraction was calculated as a percentage of 
total coal samples. Table 4.2 shows the particle size distribution of middlings before 
crushing. It is observed that nearly half of the coal falls in 1 x ½ inch size fraction. The + 
1-inch fraction in middling is 39% while ½ x 1/4-inch fraction is nearly 13% of the total 
coal sample. The overall average ash content of each size fraction was around 20%.

-1/2" + 1/4" 12.86 19.52 5.00 
 
The washability characteristics of coal samples were evaluated by performing float and 
sink tests. This test determines the distribution of mass in various density fractions. An 
inorganic liquid LMT was used for preparing media of desired density. LMT liquid is 
chemically lithium metatungstate. LMT is a heavy liquid of specific gravity 2.95. LMT is 
preferred because it is economic, safe, affordable and thermally stable liquid. The float and 
sink analysis was performed using the following specific gravities: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 
and 1.8. To start with the test, each sample was first placed in 1.3 specific gravity bath. The 
float was removed with a strainer and washed properly with hot water several times to 
remove any traces of lithium metatungstate remaining on the surface of coal particles. The 
cleaned samples were dewatered using filters and dried subsequently. The sink fraction 
was washed with hot water and then transferred to subsequent higher specific gravity baths. 
This process was continued until the particles floated and sunk in specific gravity 1.8. The 
20 
 
sample was separated into six specific gravity fractions. After the float and sink tests, 
various float and sink fractions obtained are weighed and assayed for mineral matter 
content. The float and sink tests were done for all three-size fractions of middlings received 
after screening:  +1 inch, 1 x 1/2 inch and 1/2 x 1/4 inch.  
Table 4.3 shows the washability characteristics of +1-inch size coal sample in uncrushed 
middlings. For +1 inch uncrushed middlings, the analytical data indicates that 81% of total 
mass has a relative density less than 1.5 and has a cumulative ash content of around 
17.89%. The material heavier than 1.7 S.G. is very less.

4.2 Comminution using Hammer mill 
In this research, a laboratory scale Hammer mill crusher, Model 401XLA1-FC, 230/3/60Hz 
was used for the crushing the middlings coal which is shown in Figure 4.2. This crusher 
has a maximum throughput capacity of 4000 pounds per hour while using a 3/8" diameter 
perforated screen plate; 2500 pounds per hour when using a 3/16" diameter screen. It can 
be used for crushing 6 inch and smaller size material down to minus 4 mesh sizes. This 
Hammer mill has a standard rotor speed of 1260 rpm. A 7.5 HP TEFC motor, of 
specifications 230V, 3 phase, and 60 Hz, powers it. The screen plates determine the top 
size of the crushed product. Screen plates have round-hole perforations. Screen plates with 
perforation diameters of 1/8 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/2 inch and 1 inch are used for crushing of 
middlings. 
In hammer mills, comminution occurs by impact rather than compression. Material is fed 
into the mill’s crushing chamber uniformly. Fracture in coal particles occurs by sharp 
blows applied by the high-speed hammers, which are attached to a shaft. Particles finer 
than the screen aperture will pass through the screen plate while coarser particles are 
retained on the screen plate. The oversize particles will be impacted and crushed by the 
hammers until grounded to the required particle size.

Scientific) 
After the screen analysis at 1 inch, ½ inch and ¼ inch, the obtained size fractions were 
weighed and crushed using a hammer mill at different top sizes. Figure 4.3 shows a detailed 
sampling process done at the laboratory. Four representative samples were obtained from 
+1-inch coal middlings fraction. The first sample of +1-inch coal was crushed to a top size 
of 1 inch in hammer mill. The other portion of +1-inch material was crushed to top size ½ 
inch. The remaining samples were crushed to top sizes 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch. From the 1 x 
1/2-inch coal middlings fraction obtained after screening, three representative samples 
were obtained. The samples were subjected to crushing in a hammer mill at 1/2 inch, 1/4 
24 
 
inch and 1/8-inch top sizes, respectively. From the 1/2 x 1/4-inch coal middlings fraction 
obtained after screening, two representative samples were obtained. The first sample was 
crushed to a top size of ¼ inch using hammer mill. The other sample of 1/2 x 1/4-inch coal 
was crushed to 1/8-inch top size.

4.3 Liberation from Middlings 
4.3.1 Crushing of +1 inch middlings coals to different size fractions 
+1 inch middlings coals crushed to top size 1 inch 
After crushing the +1-inch coal sample to a top size of 1 inch in a hammer mill, a screen 
analysis was done using screens of following apertures: 1/2 inch, 3/8 inch, 1/4 inch, 18 
mesh and 100 mesh. The size fractions obtained from screening were weighed. The weight 
of coal in each size fraction was calculated as a percentage of total coal. Table 4.6 shows 
the particle size distribution of +1 inch middlings fraction after crushing to top size 1 inch. 
It can be seen that nearly 55% of coal went down to size 1/4"+1 mm after being crushed to 
1-inch top size. However, the amount of +1mm coal is 71.8% of total crushed material, 
which can still be treated using a dense media cyclone in coarse coal beneficiation circuit.

+1 inch middlings coals crushed to top size 1/2 inch 
After crushing the +1-inch coal sample to a top size of 1/2 inch in a hammer mill, a screen 
analysis was done using screens of following apertures: 3/8 inch, 1/4 inch, 18 mesh and 
100 mesh. The size fractions obtained from screening were weighed. The weight of coal in 
each size fraction was calculated as a percentage of total coal. Table 4.7 shows the particle 
size distribution of +1 inch middlings fraction after crushing to top size 1/2 inch. Most of 
the size fraction again went to size 1/4"+1 mm after crushing. The +1mm coal is 65% of 
total crushed material, which can still be washed using a dense media cyclone in coarse 
coal beneficiation circuit. However, the -1mm fraction increased by 7% as compared to 
crushing to 1inch top size.

weighed. The particle size distribution of +1 inch middlings fraction after crushing to top 
size 1/4 inch is presented in Table 4.8.  Crushing generated majority of - 1mm + 100 mesh 
coal fraction, which will be treated in fine beneficiation circuit. However, 38 % of coal is 
still +1mm, which can be treated using DMC.

coal in each size fraction was calculated as a percentage of total coal. Table 4.10 shows the

4.4 Experimental Results 
Liberation studies can be done using float and sink analysis.  The washability 
characteristics of a coal can be provided by float and sink tests using liquids of required 
specific gravity. The washability tests were conducted to obtain seven density fractions, 
beginning at 1.3 and increased in increments of 0.1 till specific gravity of 1.9. 
4.4.1 Crushing of +1 inch middlings coals to different size fractions 
Table 4.15 shows the washability characteristics of +1-inch size coal middlings sample 
after crushed to a top size of 1 inch in a hammer mill. The analytical data indicates that 
crushing of middlings have generated 12.4% of 1.3 floats with 6.66% ash and 2.98% sulfur. 
In the crushed sample, nearly 71% of total mass has a relative density less than 1.5 and has 
a cumulative ash content of around 12.51% and 3.51% sulfur. The material heavier than 
1.9 S.G. is around 7%.

From these washability tables, it can be seen that by crushing to finer sizes, the amount of 
material in 1.5 floats decreases. However, the quality of 1.5 floats improves as ash and 
sulfur values decrease. 
The relative cleanability of middlings after being crushed to different top sizes can be 
assessed by plotting the cumulative float curves against ash and sulfur values for various 
regrinding sizes. The above washability data have been used for plotting the cumulative 
float curves. 
Figure 4.4 shows the cumulative mass yield –ash curves for +1 inch middlings coals before 
crushing and after being crushed to top sizes 1 inch, 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch. The 
curves show the changes in coal cleanability characteristics resulting from crushing to 
various sizes. From these mass yields – ash plots, it is observed that although crushing coal 
+1-inch coal to different top sizes resulted in decrease of ash percentage. However, the 
percent reduction in ash remained fairly constant across all the sizes.

Figure 4.5 shows the cumulative float– sulfur curve for +1 inch middlings coals before 
crushing and after being crushed to top sizes 1 inch, 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch and 1/8 inch. By 
crushing +1-inch coal to different top sizes, sulfur percentage reduced significantly as 
compared to the uncrushed middlings. The percent reduction in sulfur increased with finer 
crushing sizes.

4.4.2 Crushing of 1 x 1/2 inch middlings coals to different size fractions 
Table 4.19 shows the washability characteristics of 1 x ½ -inch size coal middlings sample 
after crushed to a top size of ½ inch in a hammer mill. It can be seen that crushing has 
generated nearly 12% of 1.3 floats with flow ash content. The analytical data also indicates 
that a fairly easy density based separation can be achieved at 1.5 S.G. In the crushed 
sample, around 66% material is lighter than 1.5 relative density with cumulative ash 
content of 12.62% and 3.42% sulfur.
