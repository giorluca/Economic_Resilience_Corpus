Specifically, information relating to both longer term climate change and weathervariability are combined to identify potential resource implications for health service planning whenfaced with higher frequencies of heatwaves. A range of climate projection-city combinations are exploredin order to test the robustness of the economic justification for heatwave warning systems (HWWS) inEurope – London, Madrid and Prague. Our results demonstrate that in most cases the HWWS optioncan be justified in the current climate – it is therefore a ‘‘no/low regret” option. Our results also show thatwhilst costs increase slightly under climate change scenarios, benefits of HWWS are likely to increasemore steeply in European contexts. However, whilst the majority of cost-benefit analysis (CBA) outcomesare found to be positive, (i.e. economic benefits are greater than economic costs), across alternative cli-mate projection-city combinations, in sensitivity analyses it is possible to generate negative results incertain geographical contexts. Indeed, with respect to this climate change risk, this analysis has identifiedthat the analysis of key uncertainties, such as effectiveness of HWWSs and the valuation of healthimprovements, is critical in strengthening the case for HWWS implementation. 2016 The Authors.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-NDlicense (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).Practical ImplicationsThe paper undertakes a quantitative analysis of both the costs and benefits of heatwave warning systems, (HWWSs), in the citiesof London, Madrid and Prague from the present day to 2050 – the mid-point in the period, 2035–2064, for which the climate projec-tions exist. These HWWSs currently exist and rely on the local meteorological institutes to provide advance warning of heatwaveconditions. We compare the discounted benefits and costs of the HWWSs to derive net present value (NPV) and benefit-cost(B-C) ratio estimates under a baseline (no climate change) and three climate change scenarios. Unlike previous assessments thisanalysis uses real-world data, combined with current climate scenario and population projections to provide results that can informstrategies to respond to heat-wave conditions. The central results are presented in Table 1. These results show that under the coreassumptions adopted the existing HWWSs pass the economic criterion – known as economic efficiency – since they have positiveNPV and B-C ratios greater than one.However, the paper also shows that the effectiveness of theHWWS is not well-established and may vary depending on loca-tion. Thus, in sensitivity analysis it is demonstrated that when alow rate of effectiveness is assumed for the London HWWS eco-nomic efficiency is no longer guaranteed. One implication for pol-icy makers – at least in London – is therefore to ensure thateffectiveness is likely to be reasonably high; this may entail mon-itoring the performance of HWWS in the near future, as well asensuring that lessons are learnt from the experience of other cities,im.

Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxxparticularly those like Paris and New York who are of a similar sizeto London and who face similar summer weather patterns. Com-plementary to such monitoring is the impetus that this findinggives to the exploration of other options – such as those presentedin Table 6 – that help to reduce the health risks of heatwaves.These include cross-sectoral options that incorporate spatialplanning.A second important finding from a policy perspective is that thepreventative resource costs – as well as the resource health treat-ment costs avoided – implied by the operation of the HWWS rise asthe frequency of heatwaves in the three cities increases underfuture climate change. However, the three climate scenarios indi-cate that the uncertainty surrounding these estimates is signifi-cant. A policy implication of this is that in order to better informhealth service resource planning, it would make sense to continueto invest in climate services that were able to reduce the range ofuncertainty over time.1. IntroductionAn increase of heat-related mortality and morbidity is identifiedas being a potentially significant consequence of climate change inEurope (Menne and Ebi, 2006; Confalonieri et al., 2007; Smithet al., 2014). This is of particular concern to people living in largeurban areas because the high population density in these areas –combined with the fact that heat exposure may be exacerbatedby the urban heat island effect – is likely to result in sizeable publichealth challenges (Patz et al., 2005). The need to respond to suchclimate change risks has highlighted the essential role of informa-tion provision (Fankhauser et al., 1999). Specifically, knowledgeabout expected timing and extent of risks, derived from climateprojections, can be used to inform design and implementation ofadaptation actions that reduce the impact of heat on humanhealth.This paper identifies the roles that climate and weather servicesplay in responding to risks resulting from climate variability andchange before undertaking an economic appraisal of heat warningsystems based on weather service provision. The appraisal is ofexisting heat warning systems in three major European citiesunder climate change projections for the period 2035–2064. Thepaper therefore builds upon the literature on the economic apprai-sal of heat warning systems (Ebi et al., 2004) which is limited toconsidering current climate risks, and the growing literature ofex-post evaluation of the effectiveness of such warning systems(Toloo et al., 2013). Bringing these together in a future-orientatedeconomic appraisal allows us to make initial estimates of theresource implications of adaptation to climate change, as well asthe economic justification for committing these resources in bud-getary planning.The public health context is chosen since private individuals arelikely to have imperfect knowledge of the health risks of highambient temperatures, indicating that this is an area where thereis a role for public policy intervention. The paper investigates mor-tality and morbidity associated with high temperatures. Regardingmorbidity, the study focused on respiratory hospital admissions inPlease cite this article in press as: Hunt, A., et al. Climate and weather service(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.10.004the elderly population. The rationale for this choice is that theelderly have consistently been shown to be particularly vulnerableto high temperatures, and demographic projections have identifiedthat this segment of the population is going to grow significantly inEurope throughout this century. Respiratory illness is understoodto be the dominant risk associated with high temperatures for thisage group.Section 2 describes the steps that constitute the methodadopted in this paper. Section 3 then presents the results of theeconomic appraisal of the heat warning system, before concludingthoughts are given in Section 4.2. MethodsThe methodology consisted in several steps. First, we estimatedthe impact of heat on mortality and morbidity in three Europeancities with large populations, selected as representative of threegeographic/climatological sub-regions, defined as MediterraneanEurope, North-Western Europe and Eastern Europe. Respectively,these cities are Madrid, Spain (6.5 million population in 2014),London, UK (8.6 m) and Prague, Czech Republic (1.2 m). We thenidentified potential adaptation options that could be implementedto reduce these impacts. In order to demonstrate the potential foreconomic appraisal of adaptation options, we focused on a specificoption – heat-health warning systems – whose existing featuresare described in the relevant geographical locations. This optionis then evaluated against an economic efficiency criterion acrossalternative locations. The heat health warning system in each ofthe three selected cities was evaluated separately.The analysis was undertaken over the fifty-year period to 2064,matching the lifetime assumed for adaptation options considered.This time period coincides with the period – 2035–2064, which hasbeen assessed as the period when 2 C of warming globally,relative to pre-industrial, will occur under the RCP4.5 stabilizationscenario (Vautard et al., 2014) based on a multi-model ensembleanalysis. Beyond this period, climate projections diverge signifi-cantly between scenarios, depending on the underlying assump-tions regarding the variables such as socio-economics,population, technology, etc. that drive future emissions and radia-tive forcing.(1) Identification of heat-health climate risksA principal health risk from climate change identified in Europeis the risk of mortality and morbidity associated with higher ambi-ent temperature. The epidemiological literature, (e.g. Hajat et al.,2005; Johnson et al., 2005; Carson et al., 2006; Kovats et al.,2004; Hajat et al., 2007; Kovats and Hajat 2008), reports a strongcorrelation between current temperature and mortality, with thetemperature-mortality relationship characterized by a U, V or Jshaped curve, the bottom of which indicates the level of tempera-ture where the mortality incidence is minimum (threshold).In the literature, this temperature-mortality curve is frequentlydescribed by two key parameters: the threshold value and theslope above the threshold, usually expressed in terms of changeprovision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim. Ser.A. Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxx 3in mortality associated with each 1 C change of temperatureabove the threshold value. Heat-related mortality is understoodto occur when mean daily temperature exceeds the country and/or city-specific threshold (Baccini et al., 2008).Table 2 summarizes the estimated heat-mortality relationships,or functions, for Mediterranean Europe, North-Western Europe andEastern Europe, derived from three meta-analyses conducted onthe city-specific heat-mortality functions reported in Bacciniet al. (2008). In order to capture the risk resulting from combinedheat and high humidity, daily mean temperature was used as ameasure of exposure. The estimated thresholds were 29.4 C,23.9 C and 22.6 C for Mediterranean, North-Western, and EasternEurope, respectively. The estimated increase in mortality associ-ated with 1 C increase in mean temperature above the city-specific threshold was 3.12% in the Mediterranean region and1.84% in the North-Western and Eastern European regions. Theheat-mortality curve was estimated separately by sub-region inorder to account for the heterogeneity of climate and projected cli-mate health risks across Europe (Baccini et al., 2008).In order to estimate the impact of heat on mortality during thefuture time slice 2035–2064, the estimates reported in Table 2were combined with meteorological projections arising from threedifferent regional climate model simulations reflecting the range ofuncertainty from a full multi-model ensemble (Vautard et al.,2014). These projections spanned a 25 km  25 km grid over theEuropean domain and consisted in daily time series (one for eachgrid cell) of several meteorological indicators. We considered pro-jected mean temperatures and relative humidities, and for eachcell and day, we calculated mean apparent temperature (AT)according to the following formula:AT ¼ c1 þ c2  T þ c3  RH þ c4  T  RH þ c5  T2 þ c6  RH2 þ c7 T2  RH þ c8  T  RH2 þ c9  T2  RH2where T and RH are daily mean temperature (C) and relativehumidity (%), respectively, and ci, i = 1. . .9 are fixed coefficients(c1 = 42.38, c2 = 2.04901523, c3 = 10.14333127, c4 = 0.22475541,c5 = 0.00683783, c6 = 0.05481717, c7 = 0.00122874, c8 =0.00085282, c9 = 0.00000199). Apparent temperatures were setto T if T < 27 C and RH <40%, following Rothfusz (1990) andAnderson et al. (2013).Then, for each cell and day, we calculated the daily attributablefraction (AF), i.e. the fraction of deaths attributable to mean appar-ent temperatures (AT) above the threshold:AF ¼ 1 1= expðbðAT hÞÞ ifAT > hAF ¼ 0 ifAT P h ð1Þwhere b is the estimated slope above the threshold assuming a Vshape for the heat-mortality curve on a log scale, and h is the esti-mated threshold. The average AF during each warm season (April1st-September 30th) in the period 2035–2064 was thus estimatedfor Spain, UK and Czech Republic by averaging AFs over days andcells by country. Finally, indicating with AFc,m,t the average AF forTable 2Heat-mortality functions – EU regions.Threshold meantemperatureHeat-mortality function(% increase in mortality per 1 Cincrease in temperature)Mediterranean EU 25.7 3.12North-western EU 21.1 1.84Eastern EU 19.3 1.84Note: in Baccini et al.

The population was assumed tochange over time according to the scenario SSP2 scenario con-structed by OECD (Chateau and Dellink (2012).1 The crude mortalityrate was projected under the assumption of constant fertility.Table 3 summarizes the results for the three EU countries. Theresults are presented for the three regional climate models: SMHIRCA4 (hottest), LSC REMO (coolest) and KMNI RACMO22E (med-ian). In the second column block, the average attributable fractionsfor each region during the time slice are given. The estimated attri-butable deaths per year are reported in the third column block. Inthe last column, the estimated numbers of attributable deaths peryear under the assumption of no climate change are reported. Forexample, we expect that in Spain during the future period 2035–2064, under the hot scenario, around 2.13% of deaths during sum-mer will be due to temperatures exceeding the threshold of 25.7 Cestimated for the Mediterranean region. This percentage corre-sponds to 6721 attributable deaths per year.Table 4 then shows the average number of attributable deathsper year for the three cities: London, Madrid and Prague, in the2035–2064 time-slice, under the three climate models as well asunder the assumption of no climate change.2.1. MorbidityIt is likely that there exist morbidity-based health impacts inaddition to mortality impacts, although these are less clearlydefined in the underlying health studies. Heatwaves (i.e. continu-ous days of exceptional heat) have been shown to increase respira-tory and cardiovascular illnesses (Patz et al., 2005). Exposure tohigh temperatures during heatwaves may cause dehydrationpartly attributable to certain side-effects of drugs (e.g. impairedthermoregulation and suppressed thirst) (Stoellberger et al.,2009), heat cramps caused by fluid and electrolyte imbalancesoften caused by exertion, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke whichcan result in organ failure, brain damage or death. Despite varia-tion in findings relating to the different morbidity impacts of hightemperatures, there is clear evidence of increased overall morbid-ity associated with historical heatwaves. For example, there were35 % more hospital admissions of the elderly (aged 65 or older)during the 1995 heatwave in Chicago, compared with the typicalaverage number of admissions (Semenza et al., 1999). Similarly, atotal of 3% excess emergency department visits and 1% excess hos-pitalizations in California were identified during the 2006 heat-wave (Knowlton et al., 2009), and an excess of 1% totalemergency hospital admissions in England were found during the2003 heatwave (Johnson et al., 2005).There are a number of reasons why the morbidity results aremore disparate and less conclusive, including a lack of convergencein the metrics used in different locations as well as the lack ofreporting of many more minor health conditions. Moreover, dueto the number of available hospital beds is usually decided basedalso on logistic and administrative issues, the number of hospitaladmissions might in some case poorly reflect the actual populationdemand for health assistance. However, it can be concluded that1 Data downloaded from https://secure.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/ene/SspDb.provision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim.

Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxxgenerally hotter climatic conditions and more frequent and intenseheatwaves are likely to cause an increase in patient-days per yearin hospital in the EU due to heat-related illness (i.e. hospital admis-sions attributable to high temperatures but not necessarily diag-nosed as hyperthermia, heat stroke, etc.). The rate of change ismore uncertain than that of heat-related mortality. However,Donaldson et al. (2002) indicates a linear relationship betweenheat related mortality and heat related patient-days which theyestimated as 102 patient days in hospital for every one death.Although this figure can be considered uncertain due to the verylimited published evidence, it can be used as an indication of asuitable function for this metric. Heat related morbidity is there-fore tentatively determined by multiplying the heat related mor-tality deaths by 102. The resulting morbidity cases per year inthe three cities are presented in Table 5.The results presented in Tables 3–5 are generated under theassumptions that currently heat-health warning systems do notexist and that acclimatization mechanisms do not occur. As out-lined in the Discussion section below these mechanisms are notyet well understood and so we are not yet able to make allowancesfor them under future climate projections with confidence; it istherefore more transparent to hold temperature-health relation-ships constant at current levels. The next step – 2 – is to identifywhat options are open to reduce the size of these risks.(2) Identify adaptation responsesAcross Europe, there are generally understood to be a largenumber of potential adaptation options available to address manyof the identified climate risks. Adaptation options may take a num-ber of forms including, but not limited to: infrastructure invest-ments; financial incentives: autonomous and regulated priceadjustments; voluntary behavioral change, and; undertakingTable 5Expected annual number of attributable patient-days in the three cities for the period 2035–globally and assuming no climate change.Location Attributable Patient-Days per yearClimate model Hot MedianMadrid 94,605 56,120London 3386 2581Prague 10,373 8048Please cite this article in press as: Hunt, A., et al. Climate and weather service(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.10.004management decision-making processes that incorporate climatechange risks. These options also vary widely between aggregationlevels and governance and according to different socio-economicfutures. In the context of heat-health risks, a range of options canbe identified that may either be introduced immediately or overa longer passage of time. Examples of these are presented inTable 6.The options identified in Table 6 clearly have degrees of bothsubstitutability and complementarity with each other. Indeed,recent adaptation frameworks have moved away from thinkingabout single time-bound solutions for adaptation and insteadadvance iterative risk management and the use of adaptation path-ways (Downing, 2012). These recognize the evolving nature offuture risks under increasing levels of climate change – as wellas the high uncertainty involved. The response is to advance adap-tive management approaches that include complementary portfo-lios which allow for learning and updated responses.In this paper we select the Heat-Health Watch system for eco-nomic appraisal. We focus on this option because experience todate in its implementation can shed light on the quantitative needsof this appraisal. It also has the merit of being flexible with respectto the degree of climate variability and change that occurs over thelifetime of the system.The Heat-Health Watch system that currently operates in Lon-don is incorporated in the Heat Wave Plan for England. This is out-lined below.The Heat Wave plan for England, 2015The heat-wave plan (NHS England, 2015) and supporting docu-ments describe the responsibilities of a number of implementingorganizations, including Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), Local Author-ities (LAs), Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) and NHS Trusts. Thecore elements of the plan are:– ‘Heat-Health watch’ over the summer months which triggerslevels of response (Levels 1–4);– Advice and information direct to the public and health andsocial care professionals;– Guidelines for the identification of individuals at risk and localadvice for assisting these individuals;– Extra assistance from the voluntary sector, families and othersto care for those most at risk;– The use of the media to get the information disseminated bothbefore and during a heatwave;– Long term multi-agency planning to adapt to and reduce theimpact of climate change, including ‘greening the built environ-ment’, increasing shading around and insulation of buildings,increasing energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.2064 under the three climate models (hot, median and cool models) for 2 C warmingCool No climate change55,988 20,7062183 6127742 3774provision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim.

Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxx 5The first five elements listed above are incorporated in the UKHeat Health Watch System (HWWS). In the HWWS, the UK Mete-orological Office issues heat-wave weather warnings when there isan expectation of significantly higher than average temperatures inone or more regions of England. The HHWS comprises four levels ofresponse based upon threshold maximum daytime and minimumnight-time temperatures. These thresholds vary by English region,though an average threshold temperature is 30 C by day and 15 Covernight.The HWWS operates in England from 1 June to 15 Septembereach year. The four levels of response are:Level 1 – Awareness — the minimum state of vigilance duringthe summer.Level 2 – Alert — triggered as soon as the risk is 60% or above forthreshold temperatures being reached on at least two consecutivedays to have significant effects on health. This will normally occur2–3 days before the event is expected.Level 3 – Heatwave — triggered as soon as the MeteorologicalOffice confirms threshold temperatures will be reached in one ormore regions.Level 4 – Emergency — reached when a heatwave is so severeand/or prolonged that its effects extend outside the health andsocial care system.This HWWS has a common four level structure with the equiv-alent systems in the Czech Republic and Spain.(3) Estimate the costs and benefits of heat-health warningsystems2.2. Resource costsStep 2 demonstrates that the heat-health warning systems cur-rently implemented in the three countries have very similar struc-tures and component actions. We therefore assume that themedical labour time resource requirements associated with thefour component actions – i.e. the levels of alarm – are equivalentin the three cities. Table 7 documents the roles of these health pro-fessionals and the associated resource implications of these rolesthat we assume in this analysis.The three warning systems are formulated principally as requir-ing action by health professionals, notably local Health Visitors andPlease cite this article in press as: Hunt, A., et al. Climate and weather service(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.10.004District Nurses, who are primarily involved in the care of the localpopulation in their homes, rather than in hospitals. We assumethat the co-ordinating action of nurse and health visitor team lead-ers is included in the time that is allocated to nurses/healthvisitors.The warning systems are evaluated on the basis of the costs andbenefits associated with their implementation. The HWWS is con-sidered over a 50-year time period, from 2015 to 2064. The currentand future costs of the warning systems are calculated according toa series of stages:(a) The total number, (full-time equivalents), of Health Visitors(HVs) and District Nurses (DNs) currently working in eachcity, allocated to ‘‘acute, elderly and general” populations,are calculated.2 As of July 2010 these totals are 743 and733, for HVs and DNs, respectively in London. For Madridand Prague, these are scaled on the basis of total population– 37% and 15%, respectively. The sum of these HVs and DNsare the total Health Professionals (HPs) assumed to beemployed and engaged in the demographic group most vul-nerable to heat-waves.(b) The employment totals are projected over the 50 year timeperiod under the IIASA SSP2 population scenario. It isassumed that the population-HP ratio is kept constant attoday’s levels over this time period.(c) The annual cost of employing an HP is calculated from costinformation identified for the three cities. Cost informationincludes: salary, on-costs, non-capital overheads, capitaloverheads. These are converted to Euro 2010 prices anddivided by 220 (annual working days) to give costs of€202/day (London),3 €97/day (Madrid)4 and €71/day(Prague).5provision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim.

Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxx(d) The total HP costs for the three cities are calculated for thefour different warning levels. We adopt the Summer 2003heatwave as a historical analogue to which costs can be cal-ibrated. The 2003 heatwave is characterized as a 1 in100 year event, which is projected to become more frequentunder all climate change scenarios.a. For Level 1, as identified in Table 7, it is assumed that each HPtypically spends one hour of time per year meeting itsrequirements. This day-fraction, (0.125), is first multipliedby the day resource cost identified above. This HP unit costis then multiplied by the total numbers of HPs in each city.In addition to these costs, the costs associated with theweather office annual contract fee, plus the costs of printing,distribution and storage of information leaflets and documen-tation are derived to give a total annual fixed cost of thewarning system. This is estimated to be €200,000 for the UKMeteorological Office; we assume this to be the same for bothPrague and Madrid. This relates to the additional marginalcost for the information provision, and assumes that a base-line climate service is already in place (WHO RegionalOffice for Europe (2009).b. For Level 2, the HP unit cost is estimated in the same way asfor Level 1. The incidence costs of a level 2 event are esti-mated on the basis of those incurred in the Summer 2003event. The probability of an equivalent event occurring isderived from the climate model projections adopted. Theseprobabilities are multiplied by the unit cost; the resultingexpected annual HP unit cost is then multiplied by the totalnumbers of HPs deployed in each year to produce a Level 2total annual variable cost.c. For Level 3, the total annual variable cost is estimated in thesame way as for level 2. The weather event is assumed to lasteight days.d. For Level 4, using the Summer 2003 experience in London asan analogue, there are assumed to be no additional HP coststo those associated with Level 3. This is a conservativeassumption: a more severe event – of the type experiencedby Paris in 2003 – is estimated to justify an increase in HPcosts of 25–50%.It should be emphasized that this method under-estimates thetrue resource costs of heat-waves. The principal reason for this isthat the cost estimates derived here are made on the basis of theprojection of a single heat-wave frequency/intensity, characterizedPlease cite this article in press as: Hunt, A., et al. Climate and weather service(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.10.004as equating to the dimensions of that which occurred in August2003 in Europe. The true total resource costs will be those associ-ated with the heat-wave events to 2064 resulting from the fullrange of projected heat-wave frequencies/intensities which maybe more or less frequent than the 1:100 year event used here asa cost analogue. Our cost estimates are therefore likely to beunder-estimates of the true costs.2.3. BenefitsWe measure the benefits of implementing a heat warning sys-tem as the reduction in health impacts – whether prematuredeaths or patient-days. The benefits are determined by the effec-tiveness of the warning system. To date, there is no publishedquantitative evidence of the effectiveness of these systems in thethree cities we are studying. However, a recent review of the rele-vant literature by Toloo et al. (2013) identifies a small number ofstudies on heat warning effectiveness that have been undertakenglobally. Two studies in Europe include Fouillet et al. (2008) thatcompares deaths before and after HWS implementation in France,in 2003 and 2006, respectively and Morabito et al. (2012) thatundertake the same comparison in Florence, Italy. Whilst theFrench study finds effectiveness of 68% when the number of fatal-ities avoided is used as the measure of effectiveness, the Florentinestudy finds effectiveness of 9%, using the same metric. Outside Eur-ope, two studies in North America compared fatalities avoidedbetween the 1995 and 1999 heatwaves as a result of HWWSs beingintroduced between these events. Weisskopf et al. (2002) show areduction in mortality of 88% in Milwaukee, USA, whilst Paleckiet al. (2001) find a mortality reduction of 84%. The Toloo et al.review does, however, highlight the fact that these studies do notattempt to isolate other factors that might have influenced themortality data, such as people’s preparedness based on their recentexperience, and the different intensities of the heatwave eventsthat are compared.In looking to transfer these results to the context of the threecities discussed in our study, other factors such as lack of compa-rability of HWWSs, availability and cost of air conditioning, andforms of social capital that exist in communities within cities allreduce the reliability of doing so. Furthermore, the type of datathat might enable such a transfer to be approximated is not pre-sented in these studies. In the absence of any other data we ini-tially adopt the assumption that for the core analysis, the rate ofeffectiveness is the mid-point between the two observations fromprovision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim. Ser.A. Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxx 7the European studies. The mid-point is 38% and, given the lack ofevidence on which to differentiate, we apply this same value inall three cities. This is not meant to imply that the three citiesare likely to have similar contextual influences; rather, the mid-point value serves as a way of facilitating our method. Subsequentsensitivity analysis adopts the lower estimate of 9%. This uncer-tainty emphasizes the need for further research effort on HWWSeffectiveness.In order to make an initial comparison between the costs andthe benefits of the cities’ warning systems, we estimate the bene-fits in monetary terms that result when the warning systems areimplemented. We adopt the values that are currently used by theEuropean Commission in economic appraisal of environmentalpolicy proposals (see e.g. AEA 2011). Thus, in order to monetizethe benefits we adopt central unit values of €1.16 m for the Valueof a Prevented Fatality (VPF) and €750 per patient-day. There isconsiderable uncertainty in these unit values and therefore a rangeof monetary values are often used in appraisals. The measurementuncertainties are captured in the range of low, central and high val-ues given for each of the specific health impacts estimated. Uncer-tainty ranges are €315,000 (equivalent to seven life-years) and€5.5 m, and €420 and €1080, for the VPF and patient-day, respec-tively, reflecting those adopted in current appraisal guidance inEurope (AEA 2011).3. ResultsTables 8 and 9 present the annualized discounted costs andbenefits over the next 50 years for the baseline case where no cli-mate change is included. In order to be consistent with the currentpractice of the EC, a discount rate of 4% is used. These tables serveto provide an indication of the scale of costs and benefits for a sin-gle, given, year during the period of interest. Table 8 shows theannual average costs for the three cities, disaggregated by theimplementation level of the HWWS.Level 1 costs are the highest associated with the levels, reflect-ing the high annual fixed costs associated with having a heathealth warning system. Level 3 costs are higher than Level 2 costs,reflecting the fact that in the event of a heat event of this magni-tude occurring, the time incurred in providing the care to the pop-ulation will be substantial. The costs for London are greatest,reflecting the larger number of health professionals who areemployed to serve the higher population size.Table 9 present the annualized benefits of the warning systemsin the three cities in the absence of climate change – disaggregatedby mortality and morbidity.

Com-parison of the annual total benefits with the annual total costs foreach of the cities indicates that benefits are significantly greaterthan costs.For the three cities, Tables 10 and 11 give the present value (PV)– i.e. discounted – costs and benefits, respectively, summed overthe 50 year period for which the HWWS is assumed to operateover, in the baseline ‘‘no climate change” scenario, and under thethree climate change scenarios adopted.Table 10 shows the PV costs in each city. Although the costs areshown to be larger in London and Madrid as the climate changesignal increases across the scenarios, the variation in costs is lessthan 10%. In Prague, although the results differ across scenarios,rounding of the results has removed any clear variation. This pat-tern results from the fact that costs are dominated by the annualcosts of weather information provision that are incurred irrespec-tive of heatwave incidence.Table 11 presents the PV benefits for each of the three cities,assuming a rate of effectiveness of the HWWS of 38% and the useof the core economic values – €1.16 m for each fatality preventedand €750 per patient-day prevented. The results show that thebenefits under the climate change scenarios range between 25%and 170% higher than those under the no climate change baselinescenario. In relative terms, the climate signal effect is greatest inLondon and least in Prague whilst in absolute terms the benefitsare greatest for Madrid and least in London. These results seemto reflect the fact that the epidemiological evidence finds that Lon-don populations are currently most sensitive to high temperatures,whilst on average temperatures in Madrid are significantly closerto the health vulnerability threshold that is breached in heatwaveconditions.Table 12 presents the results of the cost-benefit analysis under-taken with the PV cost and benefit data shown above. The net pre-sent value (NPV) – PV benefits minus PV costs – is presented foreach city-scenario combination, alongside the benefit-cost ratio.The results show that in all twelve combinations the NPV is posi-tive and benefit-cost ratio greater than one, suggesting that theseHWWS can be justified against the criterion of economic efficiency.The results are most striking for Madrid where the benefits out-weigh the costs by between €2 billion and €4.7 billion. The positivebaseline results confirm that the HWWS schemes that exist in thethree cities are economically efficient, whilst the net benefitsincrease under the three climate change scenarios adopted.The Methods section of this paper highlights the fact that thereare a number of uncertainties accompanying the assumptionsTable 10Warning System Present Value Costs 2014–2065 (€, 2010).London Madrid PragueBaseline 5,400,000 2,300,000 1,300,000Cool 5,600,000 2,400,000 1,300,000Median 5,700,000 2,400,000 1,300,000Hot 5,800,000 2,500,000 1,300,000Table 11Warning System Present Value Benefits – Core (€, 2010).London Madrid PragueBaseline 60,000,000 2,100,000,000 400,000,000Cool 120,000,000 3,300,000,000 500,000,000Median 130,000,000 3,300,000,000 500,000,000Hot 160,000,000 4,700,000,000 600,000,000provision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim.

Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxxadopted in our economic modelling. Principal uncertaintiesinclude: climate sensitivity; valuation of health risks, and; effec-tiveness of adaptation options. Other potentially significant uncer-tainties include: discount rate; resource costs of HWWS;population size, life-time of the HWWS, and; heath sensitivity tohot ambient temperatures. Consequently, we re-run our CBAmodel to test whether the core results are likely to be differentwhen the core assumptions are dropped. Specifically, our sensitiv-ity analysis changes the assumptions relating to the valuation ofhealth risks and effectiveness of HWWS in the benefits analysisin order to test whether the positive CBA findings are altered. Inboth instances we lower the values; the effectiveness of HWWSis assumed to be 9% – the lower-bound value found in the existingevidence base – whilst the mortality and morbidity risk values areassumed to be €315,000 and €420, respectively.Table 13 shows the PV benefits resulting from the sensitivityanalysis. In all scenario-city combinations, these benefits are verysubstantially lower than those derived using the core assumptionsin Table 13 – at least two orders of magnitude smaller.Table 14 presents the CBA indices that result from our sensitiv-ity analysis. The most notable finding is that – in the case of Lon-don – the NPVs are now negative, and B-C ratios are below one.Thus, for this city the economic efficiency rationale no longer existsunder either ‘‘no climate change” or climate change scenarios. InMadrid and Prague, the indices are also significantly lower thanin the core analysis, though still positive.4. DiscussionThis paper has sought to demonstrate that the value of climateprojection information can be used to derive quantitative esti-mates of both the costs and benefits of information-based mea-sures introduced to reduce climate-related risks. Specifically,information relating to both longer term climate change andPlease cite this article in press as: Hunt, A., et al. Climate and weather service(2016), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cliser.2016.10.004weather variability are combined to identify potential resourceimplications for health service planning when faced with higherfrequencies of heatwaves. In practical terms, this may requireincreased recruitment and training of health professionals on aseasonal basis.A range of climate projection-city combinations are explored inorder to test the robustness of the economic justification for heat-wave warning systems in Europe. The analysis highlights thatwhilst such systems have substantial annual fixed costs, the addi-tional costs incurred in the instance of heatwave events occurringare relatively low, on an annualized basis. The HWWS option alsohas the merit that it is, in principle, flexible to whatever the degreeof climate change – and the frequency/severity of associatedextreme weather events – that materializes in the future. However,in practice there is some evidence to show that increased frequen-cies of extreme weather events may ‘‘over-familiarise” people tothe risk, leading to a likelihood that they ignore warnings therebyreducing their effectiveness (Sheridan, 2007). This potentialityargues that the HWWS option may be insufficient on its own andthat as residual climate risks increase over time there is increasedjustification for moving along an adaptation pathway that offersdiverse and complementary options for risk reduction.Our results demonstrate that in most cases the HWWS optioncan be justified in the current climate – it is therefore a ‘‘no/lowregret” option. Our results also show that whilst costs increaseslightly under climate change scenarios, benefits of HWWS arelikely to increase more steeply in these European city contexts,whilst the uncertainties in assessment of these benefits preventseasy generalization of these results to country-scale. However,whilst the majority of CBA indices are found to be positive acrossalternative climate projection-city combinations, in sensitivityanalyses where important assumptions are modified together, itis possible to generate negative results in certain geographical con-texts. Indeed, with respect to this climate change risk, this analysishas identified that the analysis of key uncertainties is critical instrengthening the case for HWWS implementation.In interpreting our results it should be considered that our anal-yses were conducted under the assumption of no future change ofthe heat-mortality association resulting from population acclimati-zation/adaptation under a climate change scenario. Despite the factthat some authors have recently found that mortality risk due toheat decreased over time in several countries (Gasparrini et al.,2015), more evidence would be needed to allow formulation ofappropriate hypotheses on how much and when in the future theheat-mortality curve will change. This is the reason why in thiswork we preferred to assume the absence of changes in physiolog-ical, behavioral and external factors that could determine futureacclimatization.Additionally, whilst the risk measure used in this study is for thewhole population, certain groups, particularly the elderly and thosewith pre-existing respiratory and/or cardiovascular diseases are at ahigher risk of dying during hot weather (Matthies and Menne,2008). The evidence for this was seen clearly in the France 2003heat-wave, where excess mortality rates rose dramatically for the75–94 age group (Pirard et al., 2005). Similarly, the effects of the2003 heat wave were greatest amongst the elderly in London inprovision: Economic appraisal of adaptation to health impacts. clim. Ser.A. Hunt et al. / Climate Services xxx (2016) xxx–xxx 9terms of the number of deaths per head of population (GLA, 2006).Other factors have also been identified as determining the heat-mortality incidence and include whether people live on their own,their ability to look after themselves, the availability and qualityof social care or family/peer groups and the quality of care in carehomes and hospitals. There is also a further set of factors relatedto the built environment. Finally, temperatures are often higher inurban environments because of the urban heat island (UHI) effect.London already has a well-documented heat island effect (GLA,2006), and UHI intensities in excess of 7 C have been recorded. Inour analysis we did not account for these factors, leading to a likelyunder-estimation of the impact of heat on the three cities.AcknowledgementsThe research leading to these results has received funding fromthe European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007–2013) under the project: IMPACT2C: Quantifying projectedimpacts under 2 C warming, grant agreement no. 282746, andthe project: ECONADAPT: Economics of Climate Change in Europe,grant agreement no. 603906.ReferencesAEA, 2011.
