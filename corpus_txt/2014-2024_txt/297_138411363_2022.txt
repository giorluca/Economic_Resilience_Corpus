However, high suspended solids and dissolved organic matter concentrations canreduce the effectiveness of the technology. In this study, coagulation–flocculation (C/F) and aerationpre-treatments were evaluated to reduce chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity, suspendedsolids and alkalinity before the ammonia recovery stage using a membrane contactor. The masstransfer coefficient (Km) and total ammonia (TAN) recovery efficiency of the membrane contactorincreased from 7.80 × 10−7 to 1.04 × 10−5 m/s and from 8 to 67%, respectively, after pre-treatingthe real sidestream centrate. The pre-treatment results showed that dosing aluminium sulphate(Al2(SO4)3) at 30 mg Al/L was the best strategy for the C/F process, providing COD, turbidity andTSS removal efficiencies of 50 ± 5, 95 ± 3 and 90 ± 4%, respectively. The aeration step reduced51 ± 6% the HCO3− content and allowed reducing alkaline consumption by increasing the pH beforethe membrane contactor. The techno-economic evaluation showed that the combination of C/F,aeration and membrane contactor can be economically feasible for ammonia recovery. Overall, theresults of this study demonstrate that C/F and aeration are simple and effective techniques to improvemembrane contactor performance for nitrogen recovery from the anaerobic digestion centrate.Keywords: gas permeable membrane; coagulation–flocculation; resource recovery; circular economy;techno-economic evaluation1. IntroductionNutrient pollution is one of the major environmental problems due to excessivedischarge of nitrogen and phosphorus into the environment. Anthropogenic activitiesand population growth have increased the amount of nitrogen contained in wastewater.The recovery of this nitrogen is particularly important considering that ammonia is thesecond most produced chemical in the world [1–3]. Ammoniacal nitrogen recovery has thepotential (i) to reduce the dependency of the Haber–Bosch process to obtain nitrogen-basedfertilizers, (ii) to produce a fertilizer (e.g., NH4NO3, (NH4)2HPO4, (NH4)2SO4) suitable forcommercialization and (iii) to reintroduce nitrogen into its cycle contributing to the circulareconomy [4,5]. For this reason, it is important to develop efficient technologies for nitrogenrecovery to support the transition of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) towards waterresource recovery facilities (WRRF) [6].Several technologies have been proposed to recover nitrogen from wastewater treat-ment plants (WWTPs), such as ion exchange (IX) technologies [7], membrane contactors(MC) [8–10] or ultrafiltration (UF) [11]. For instance, Wan et al. [12] effectively recoverednutrients from the sludge fermentation liquor in a WWTP (N-NH4+ and P-PO43-) usingMembranes 2022, 12, 1251. https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes12121251 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/membranesMembranes 2022, 12, 1251 2 of 19natural zeolites and proposed a model to predict that a maximum recovery of 94% ammo-nium and 98% phosphate could be achieved. Among them, ammoniacal nitrogen recoverythrough membrane contactors has been reported as a suitable technology to achieve highnitrogen recovery efficiencies with relatively low energy inputs [5]. By this technology,ammonia in gas form diffuses through a porous hydrophobic membrane from the feedsolution to the acidic stripping solution. Subsequently, it can be recovered in ammoniumform as a nitrogen-rich fertilizer. [13]. Vecino et al. [14] used a membrane contactor forammonium recovery as a nutrient-based fertilizer product and achieved a maximum am-monium recovery of 94% using a regenerated stream with ion exchange from an initialsidestream wastewater. Sheikh et al. [15] also achieved similar values (>95%) of recoveryusing synthetic water and liquid–liquid hollow fibre MC (LL-HFMC). Additionally, bothmembrane contactors and ion exchange technologies can be combined as proposed bySancho et al. [16]. In that study, a concentrated ammonium stream was generated by meansof liquid–liquid membrane contactors, by previously passing it through zeolites, achievinga recovery of 95% [16]. Thus, these publications highlight that membrane contactors havepotential to achieve high recovery efficiencies and to obtain ammonium-free streams.However, membrane contactors still need to overcome some challenges when usingstreams with high concentration of organic matter. Membrane fouling, caused by organicmatter and/or suspended solids, can lead to the deposition of solids as a thin cake layerand increase pore clogging [17]. This phenomenon generates a reduction in the flux duringlong-term operation. Thus, to maintain adequate flux levels, it is necessary to increaseenergy and chemical consumption with a direct impact on the membrane lifetime andeconomic feasibility [18]. In this regard, some pre-treatment strategies have been proposedto reduce fouling of membrane contactors, such as UF [19], coagulation–flocculation (C/F)processes [17] or ion exchange [20]. For example, Rivadeneyra et al. [20] used ion exchangetechnology and observed a maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencyof 70% with an initial COD load of 4500 mg O2/L. Raghu et al. [21] combined ion exchangewith coagulation–flocculation and achieved a COD removal of 80% from an industrialwastewater effluent.C/F consists of destabilization of colloids by surface modification. This reduces theelectrostatic repulsive forces between the particles and leads to the formation of larger flocswith improved settling properties [22]. The most common coagulants and flocculants usedare iron and aluminium salts because these chemicals have demonstrated their effectivenessto reduce the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of liquid streams [23,24]. C/F has beenwidely applied in wastewater treatment applications as it allows removing organic andinorganic matter with relatively low costs [19,25]. For instance, Al-Juboori et al. [26]evaluated the use of PAX/polymer or starch as a coagulant to pre-treat the centrate beforea membrane contactor.Besides C/F, aeration could also be a useful pre-treatment to reduce the amount ofchemicals needed to increase the pH before the membrane contactor stage. Garcia-Gonzalezet al. [27] applied low flow-rate aeration and increased the pH above 8.5 before the mem-brane contactor, which allowed reducing the operating costs of ammonia recovery by 57%.However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the combination of C/F technology withaeration has not yet been used to pre-treat anaerobic digester centrate prior to a membranecontactor. Therefore, an experimental and economic study is needed to understand howC/F pre-treatment impacts the technical and economic competitiveness of implementing amembrane contactor system for nitrogen recovery.The aim of this work is to evaluate the combination of C/F, aeration and membranecontactor processes to recover ammoniacal nitrogen from the effluent of an anaerobicdigester (centrate). To this end, different operating conditions and chemical reagents wereevaluated for the C/F process. After the C/F process, an aeration stage was used to reducethe amount of bicarbonates in the centrate with a direct impact on the amount of chemicalsneeded for pH adjustment. Subsequently, the pre-treated centrate was fed to a membranecontactor system to understand how pre-treatment conditions impacted the performanceMembranes 2022, 12, 1251 3 of 19of the membrane contactor and ammonium recovery efficiency. Finally, the economicpotential of implementing these pre-treatment technologies before the membrane contactorwas analyzed.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Chemical Reagent and Wastewater SourceThree types of coagulants were used for the coagulation–flocculation tests: (i) alu-minium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3 18·H2O) from Panreac® with a 96% of purity, (ii) iron chloride(FeCl3) from Acros Organics® with a 98% of purity and (iii) a commercial coagulant HT20from Derypol®. On the other hand, a mixture of Magnetite (Fe3O4) from Aldrich® with a98% purity and silicon oxide (SiO2) from Merck® with a purity of 98% (relation of 30:70%)was used as flocculant.Different reagents were used for the chromatographic analysis: Methanesulfonicacid (CH3SO3H, 99%), sodium hydrogen carbonate (NaHCO3, 99%), anhydrous sodiumcarbonate (Na2CO3, 99%), nitric acid (HNO3 69%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH 1 M). Allthese chemicals were analytical grade reagents and were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.The wastewater used in this study was the anaerobic digester centrate from a municipalWWTP located in the region of Barcelona (Spain). The centrate was decanted before thetests for 24 h to reduce its concentration of COD, total suspended solids (TSS) and turbidity.The centrate used for the C/F tests contained COD and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN)concentrations of 786 mg COD/L and 650 mg N/L, respectively, which were within therange reported in the literature [28,29]. It is worth mentioning that the water used forthe flocculant tests came from the same location and had a similar ion concentration tothat used in the other tests, although it contained a higher COD concentration (1650 mgCOD/L).2.2. Experimental DesignThe study was divided into 2 distinct stages (Figure 1). The first stage correspondedto the pre-treatment stage, selection of the optimum coagulant reagent and setting theoptimum operating conditions with a specialized experimental design program. The spe-cialized software allowed optimization of the mixing speed, mixing time and sedimentationtime to maximize COD, TSS and turbidity removal efficiencies. Besides C/F, an aerationcolumn for the removal of carbonate and the consequent increase in the pH was alsoconsidered. In the second stage, the performance of the membrane contactor (pH, concen-tration factor, ammonium recovery percentage) was tested with the untreated sidestreamwater and with the pre-treated water to evaluate the effectiveness of the pre-treatment onmembrane contactor performance. Finally, an economic analysis was conducted to evaluatethe feasibility of the application of this process train.Membranes 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 20    Figure 1.

Coagulant Selection The selection of the best coagulant reagent and dosage was based on combining lit-erature screening and lab-scale tests. Initial bibliographic research was carried out to de-termine the most common coagulants (Table 1) and it was observed that the most widely used coagulants were based on metals, such as aluminium or iron. After this initial screen-ing, aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3), iron chloride (FeCl3) and a commercial coagulant Derypol®  HT20 (which is in the category of vegetable coagulants) were chosen. Table 1.

Two set of experiments were conducted to determine the best coagulant and the dosage strategy for the C/F process. The first set of experiments was designed to determine the two most favourable co-agulants. In these tests, the type of coagulant was changed, while keeping the operating conditions constant. The dosage was set at 50 mg/L and the mixing time was 5 min at a mixing speed of 200 rpm (see Table S1 of the Supplementary Information), which was based on available literature [31,34–36]. The experiments were conducted in triplicate. The second set of experiments was designed (i) to determine the optimum dosage for the two flocculants selected in the previous experiments and (ii) to obtain the most favourable coagulant at this optimum dosage. All the coagulant dosages referred to the quantity of metal added. The impact of dosage on the efficiency of the C/F process was evaluated for the best coagulant. To this end, the dosage was varied from 10 to 800 mg/L with the Jar-test con-ditions mentioned above. Table 2 lists the experimental conditions for these tests.

Determination of the Optimal Operational Conditions for the C/F ProcessOnce the optimum coagulant chemical and dosage were selected, the most favourableoperational parameters (i.e., mixing time, mixing speed and settling time) were determinedby using the Jar-test equipment. For this purpose, a design program was used to optimizethe number of tests required and to determine the best operational conditions for theC/F process.Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 5 of 19The Design Expert® 11 software was used following the factorial design of Box–Behnken, which is based on dependent and independent variables [37]. The dependentvariables were those investigated and measured in the study, whereas the independentvariables were modified to study their effect on the dependent variables [38]. Table 3 sum-marizes the dependent variables studied in this work. The coded variables were assignedvalues of +1 (maximum), 0 (central) and −1 (minimum) depending on the variation ofeach variable.Table 3.

The number of experiments (N)needed according to the Box–Behnken design can be obtained from Equation (1).N = 2 · k(k − 1)+C0 (1)where k is the number of variables, and C0 is the number of central points [8,39]. In thiscase, three variables (MT, MV and RT) and five central points were studied resulting inseventeen experiments. The Box–Behnken experimental designs were applied by means ofEquations (3) and (4) [8].y = β0k∑i=1βiXik∑i=1k∑j≥1βijXiXj+ε (2)y = β0k∑i=1βiXi+β0k∑i=1βiiX2i +k∑i=1k∑j≥1βijXiXj+ε (3)where βo is the constant factor, βi represents the coefficients of the linear parameters, k is thenumber of variables, Xi and Xj represent the independent variables, ε is the residual factorassociated with the experiments, y is the dependent variable, βij represents the coefficientsof the interaction parameters and βii represents coefficients of the quadratic values.Finally, the software allows for analysis of the obtained results to provide the optimalconditions (e.g., removal of each of COD, TSS and turbidity) through the analysis ofgraphics and data.2.3.3. Coagulation Test for the Optimal Coagulant Conditions and DosageThe optimal coagulant and dosage obtained from stage 1 and 2 were tested to de-termine the experimental COD, TSS and turbidity removal efficiencies under the mostfavourable conditions. In this assay, the optimal conditions determined by the two previoustests were applied in the Jar-test equipment and it was verified if the theoretical results pro-vided by the experimental design software were experimentally fulfilled. The experimentswere conducted in triplicate.2.3.4. Flocculation TestFlocculation tests were conducted to evaluate if combining coagulant and flocculantaddition improves solids removal efficiency when compared with stand-alone coagulantaddition. The flocculation experiments were carried out with the optimal conditionsobtained from the previous experiments and adding different dosages (0–50 mg/L) of a clay-based flocculant (Fe3O4(s) and SiO2(s)) that works effectively with metal-based coagulantsfor COD reduction [33]. The flocculant was prepared by pulverizing and mixing Fe3O4Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 6 of 19and SiO2 with a relation of 30% Fe3O4 and 70% of SiO2. Table S2 of the SupplementaryInformation shows the operational parameters used for the flocculation tests.2.3.5. Aeration TestsThe possibility of adding an aeration stage [27,40,41] was evaluated: (i) to increase thepH of the centrate and (ii) to reduce the concentration of carbonates present in the sample.The aeration tests were carried out in an open aeration column of 3.5 m height and 30 cmdiameter with a capacity of 25 L. The air was introduced at the bottom of the tank throughan electric compressor at a flow rate of 2 Nm3/h. The column was filled with the centrateand a constant air flow rate (364 L/h) was applied for a period of time adequate to causereactions described by Equations (4)–(6).HCO−3(aq)+H+(aq) ↔ CO2(aq)+H2O(l) (4)CO2(aq) ↔ CO2(g) (5)NH+4(aq) ↔ NH3(g) +H+(g) (6)Thus, these experiments allowed bicarbonate conversion to CO2(g) (aq) /Equation (4)due to the aeration process promoting the removal of dissolved CO2(g) (aq) as CO2(g)(Equation (5)) and consequently increasing the pH. Subsequently, the pH increased allowedthe conversion of NH4+ into ammonia. (Equation (6)). The aeration experiments wereperformed in duplicate.2.3.6. Flat-Sheet Membrane ContactorThe different pre-treatment processes were aimed at conditioning the centrate to reducefouling and clogging in the membrane contactor. A flat-sheet membrane contactor similarto the one used by Hasanoĝlu et al. [10] was used in this study. The polytetrafluoroethylene(PTFE) membrane had a surface area of 90 cm2 and a pore size of 0.2 µm. The pH of the feedsolution was increased up to 10.2 with NaOH 1 M, to displace the equilibrium towards NH3.The feed solution was stored in a 5 L tank, whereas the acid stripping solution (0.4 M nitricacid) was stored in a 1.5 L tank. Both tanks were continuously agitated, while nitric acidwas continuously added to maintain the pH of the stripping solution in the acidic regime(pH < 2). The feed and stripping solutions were circulated at 450 mL/min in counter currentmode towards both sides of the membrane. Further details of the membrane contactorset-up can be found elsewhere [9].The ammonia flux through the membrane is driven by the difference between thepartial pressure on both sides of the membrane, (pNH3,f − pNH3,s) and the mass transfercoefficient(Km(NH3))(Equation (7)).JNH3 =Km(NH3)(p NH3,f − pNH3,s)RT(7)where pNH3,s is the partial pressure of ammonia in the shell side (atm), pNH3,f is the partialpressure in the feed side (atm),Km(NH3) is the ammonia mass transfer coefficient (m/s), R isthe universal gas constant coefficient (0.082 atm·m3/k mol·K) and T is the temperature ofthe system (K).Subsequently, Equation (7) can be expressed as Equation (8) considering that: (i) thepartial pressure of ammonia on both sides of the membrane can be assumed as the con-centration of ammonia on either side, (ii) the pH does not vary during the experimentalprocedure, meaning that the concentration of ammonia is proportional to the TAN concen-Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 7 of 19tration in the feed solution and (iii) the ammonia partial pressure in the stripping side isnegligible [8,14].lnC0(NH3)fCt(NH3)f=Km(NH3)AmVft (8)where Am is the membrane area (m2), C0(NH3)f and Ct(NH3)f are the feed ammonia concen-tration (mg/L) at the initial time and at the experimental time, respectively, and Vf is thefeed volume (m3).The tests were conducted for both untreated and pre-treated centrate to evaluate andcompare the membrane contactor performance before and after pre-treatment implementation.2.4. Analytical MethodsThe anions and cations were analyzed by an ion chromatography system (DionexICS-1000 and ICS-1100 Thermo-Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with a cationic detector(ICS-1000) and an anionic detector (ICS-1100) and controlled by Chromeleon® chromato-graphic software. A CS16 column (4 × 250 mm) and an AS23 column (4 × 250 mm)(Phenomenex, Barcelona, Spain) were used for cation and anion determination and quan-tification, respectively. The mobile phase was a 0.03 mol/L CH3SO3H solution for thecation system, and a mixture of 0.8 mmol/L NaHCO3 and 4.5 mmol/L Na2CO3 for theanion system.The COD was analyzed through the Standard Method 5220C using a multiparamet-ric photometer HI83224 (Hanna Instruments, Padua, Italy), whereas TSS were analyzedthrough the Standard Method 2540D [42]. A turbidimeter HI 93703 (Hanna instruments,Padua, Italy) was used to measure the turbidity. Total alkalinity was measured by titrationfollowing the Standard Method 2320B and using a T70 titrator (Mettler Toledo, Columbus,OH, United States).2.5. Economic AnalysisAn economic analysis was conducted to evaluate the techno-economic implicationsof implementing a membrane contactor system for ammonia recovery from the anaerobicdigester centrate. Figure S1 of the Supplementary Information shows the configurationevaluated in the economic analysis, which included four different stages: (i) C/F withAl2(SO4)3 to enhance solids sedimentation, (ii) precipitation for suspended solids removal,(iii) aeration to desorb part of the solubilized CO2 and reduce the alkalinity and (iv)membrane contactor system for nitrogen recovery. The membrane contactor system wasoperated by using an HNO3 trapping solution and considering a relation between the feedand trapping solution flow rate of 1:1. The pH of the feed solution was adjusted to 10.2with NaOH to displace the NH4+/NH3 equilibrium towards NH3. The trapping solutionwas continuously recirculated from the acid tank to the membrane contactor and replacedwhen the pH increased by up to 6 [28]. The mass balance was obtained considering thatthe WWTP generated 150 m3/day of centrate, containing TAN and TSS concentrations of0.71 g N/L and 0.24 g TSS/L, respectively. Detailed information on the mass balance canbe found in Table S3 of the Supplementary Information.The capital costs, operating costs and revenues were calculated using both lab-scaledata and literature average values. The capital costs accounted for membrane contactor,tanks, stirrers, blowers and pumps, whereas the operating costs accounted for energyconsumption, sludge disposal, equipment replacement and the purchase of chemicals(i.e., Al2(SO4)3, NaOH and HNO3). Finally, the revenues were obtained considering (i)the commercialization of the produced NH4NO3 and (ii) the lower nitrogen load to betreated in the mainstream of the WWTP. Tables S4 and S5 of the Supplementary Informationsummarize the main design and cost parameters used for the economic analysis.Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 8 of 19The present value (PV) of the gross cost and revenues was calculated for the nitro-gen recovery configuration by using Equations (9) and (10), respectively. Subsequently,Equation (11) was used to calculate the net present value (NPV):PVGC= CAPEX+T∑t=1OPEXt(1 + i)t(9)PVR =T∑t=1Rt(1 + i)t(10)NPV =T∑t=1Rt − OPEXt(1 + i)t− CAPEX (11)where CAPEX is the capital expenditure (EUR), OPEXt is the operating expenditure at yeart (EUR), Rt is the revenue at year t (EUR), PVGC is the PV of the gross cost (EUR), PVR isthe PV of the revenues (EUR), NPV is the net present value (EUR), i is the discount rate(5%) and T is the plant lifetime (20 years).3. Results and DiscussionThe following sections discuss the results concerning the application of C/F andaeration pre-treatments before a membrane contactor.

Coagulant and Dosage Selection for the C/F ProcessTable 5 collects the COD and turbidity removal efficiencies for the three coagulants(FeCl3, Al2(SO4)3 and Derypol® HT20) analyzed in this study. Al2(SO4)3 reported the bestCOD removal efficiencies (50.2± 1.1%), followed by FeCl3 (38.9± 0.3%) and Derypol HT20(36.0 ± 0.3%). Thus, Al2(SO4)3 and FeCl3 were selected for the next set of experiments.The turbidity removal efficiencies ranged from 74.2 to 84.7%. The lowest turbidity valueswere obtained by using FeCl3 (74.2 mg/L) and they were similar to those achieved byAbdessemed et al. [43], which achieved turbidity removal values of 66.1% using FeCl3.Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 9 of 19Table 5.

The results showed that Al2(SO4)3 providedbetter COD removal performance in comparison to FeCl3, which reinforces the idea thatAl2(SO4)3 is the most favourable coagulant–flocculant to be used as a membrane contactorpre-treatment. On the one hand, the COD removal efficiency increased from 42.5 to 51.8%as the FeCl3 concentration increased from 10 to 800 mg/L, respectively. On the other hand,the COD removal efficiency increased from 51.5 to 62.1% as the Al2(SO4)3 concentrationincreased from 10 to 200 mg/L, respectively. However, in the case of Al2(SO4)3, dosagesabove 200 mg/L only led to minimal improvements in the COD removal efficiency. Thisbehaviour is due to the fact that applying coagulant dosages above the optimal level doesnot lead to considerable improvements [44].Table 6.

In the case ofAl2(SO4)3, when the metal ion (Al+3) hydrolyzes in water, it reactsto form complex (Al(OH)n +(n−3)) compounds. This leads to the formation of CO2(g), whichincreases the acidity of the solution [23]. From the results of Table 6, it can be concluded thatdosing 30 mg/L of Al (Al2(SO4)3) can be considered as the optimum strategy because thisdosage achieved similar COD removal efficiencies than those achieved above 200 mg/L,while reducing the coagulant dosage more than seven times.3.2. Optimization of the Operating Conditions for the C/F ProcessAfter selecting the optimum coagulant and dosage (Al2(SO4)3, 30 mg Al/L), theimpact of the operational conditions (i.e., mixing time, mixing speed and settling time)on the C/F efficiency was evaluated. Seventeen experiments were tested based on theoutputs provided by the Design Expert 11 software (see Table S6 for further details onthe experimental conditions tested). These experiments were conducted changing themixing time, the mixing speed and the settling time. Figure 2 shows the theoretical TSS,turbidity and COD removal values obtained from the Design Expert 11 software for thedifferent mixing time and mixing speed conditions at a fixed settling time of 30 min. Itis worth mentioning that only the results of 30 min settling time are illustrated becausethis condition provided the best results when compared with the other settling times. Theresults highlighted that reducing the mixing time to 5 min and the mixing speed to 100 rpm,Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 10 of 19would theoretically increase removal values up to 100% in turbidity and suspended solidsand up to 70% in COD. Accordingly, the software revealed that there was better removalwhen mixing time and speed were reduced to the minimum tested values. This behaviourwas in agreement with Kan et al. [45], who reported that higher mixing speed did not givea better coagulation performance.Membranes 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 20   3.2.

A test without flocculant was alsoconducted, which consisted of applying the optimum dosages and parameters obtainedfrom the coagulant stage tests (Section 3.1). The results illustrated maximum COD removal(89.7%) when the flocculant dosage was 10 mg/L and maximum turbidity removal (83.6%)when the dosage was increased up to 30 mg/L.

According to the results obtained, it could be concluded that the addition of coagu-lant + flocculant did not provide a consistent positive improvement compared to the ad-dition of only coagulant. 3.4. Aeration Stage An aeration step was added after coagulation–flocculation to promote CO2(g) strip-ping to reduce alkalinity and increase the pH before the membrane contactor system [41]. Figure 4 shows the evolution of HCO3- removal and pH over the aeration time. The HCO3- present in the centrate was reduced by about 50% after 240 min of constant aeration, alt-hough almost 30% of elimination was reached after 15 min. The results showed that after 1 h of operation time, a compromise between carbonates removal (34%) and pH increase (8.83) was achieved, although higher removal values could be reached at expenses of higher times of operation. This agrees with the pH results, where a sudden increase was observed after 15 min of aeration, reaching a constant value after 240 min.

TheHCO3− present in the centrate was reduced by about 50% after 240 min of constant aera-tion, although almost 30% of elimination was reached after 15 min. The results showedthat after 1 h of operation time, a compromise between carbonates removal (34%) and pHincrease (8.83) was achieved, although higher removal values could be reached at expensesof higher times of operation. This agrees with the pH results, where a sudden increase wasobserved after 15 min of aeration, reaching a constant value after 240 min. It is worth men-tioning that the application of aeration could also lead to NH3 losses due to volatilization,although they did not account for more than 2% in our study (data not shown).García-González et al. [27] also used an aeration system as a membrane contactorpre-treatment stage. The aeration system increased the pH above 8.5, which allowed thepartial displacement of NH4+/NH3 equilibrium towards NH3 without the addition ofexternal chemicals. Besides technical aspects, aeration implementation has the potential toreduce the total cost of the process by 70% due to the reduction in alkaline purchasing cost(Dube et al., 2016). It is also relevant to mention that it is possible to use recycled chemicalsto further reduce the operating cost of the system.Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 12 of 19Membranes 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 20   mentioning that the application of aeration could also lead to NH3 losses due to volatiliza-tion, although they did not account for more than 2% in our study (data not shown).

Flat-Sheet Membrane Contactor Stage Figure 5 shows the membrane contactor results for the treated and untreated centrate during the experimental time. The results illustrated that the TAN recovery efficiency in-creased from 7.5 to 66.6% after implementing the pre-treatment train (Figure 5B). This highlighted that C/F and aeration pre-treatments are crucial to improve the TAN recovery efficiency from the anaerobic digester centrate using membrane contactors. In the case of the pre-treated centrate, the TAN concentration in the feed solution decreased from 0.9 g/L to 0.3 g/L (Figure 5A), whereas the TAN concentration in the acid solution increased from 0 to 2.7 g/L (Figure 5C). This agrees with the outputs of other studies recovering TAN using membrane contactors [10,14]. Similarly, the results obtained in terms of con-centration factor are in line with the results of TAN in the acid tank. The concentration factor corresponded to 3.8 and was obtained from the relationship between the ammo-nium concentration in the acid tank (3.5 g/L) and the initial ammonium concentration in the feed tank (0.9 g/L). 7.67.88.08.28.48.68.89.09.20102030405060701 2 3 4 5 10 15 20 30 60 120 180 240 300 360pHHCO3-removal (%)Time (min)Carbonates removalpHFigure 4.

Thishighlighted that C/F and aeration re-tre tments are crucial to improve the TAN recoveryefficiency from the anaerobic digester centrate using membrane contacto s. In the case ofth pre-treated centrate, the TAN conc tration in the feed solution decreased fro 0.9 g/Lto 0.3 g/L (Figur 5A), whereas the TAN concentration in the acid solution increased from 0to 2.7 g/L (Figure 5C). This agrees with the outputs of other studies recovering TAN usingmembrane contactors [10,14]. Similarly, the results obtained in terms of concentration factorare in line with the results of TAN in the acid tank. The concentration factor correspondedto 3.8 and was obtained from the relationship between the ammonium concentration in theacid tank (3.5 g/L) and the initial ammonium concentration in the feed tank (0.9 g/L).Besides the TAN recovery efficiency, the ammonia mass transfer coefficient (Km) wasalso calculated. The Km of the pre-treated centrate (1.04 × 10−5 m/s) was almost twoorders of magnitude higher than that achieved with the non-treated centrate (7.80 × 10−7m/s). These results corroborate that the implementation of C/F and aeration before themembrane contactor is needed to achieve efficient TAN recoveries from the anaerobicdigester centrate. Interestingly, the Km achieved in the present study with the pre-treatedcentrate and flat-sheet membrane contactors was higher in comparison with Km valuesreported in the literature using hollow fibre contactors (Table 8). The highest Km achievedin this study could be attributed to the high efficiency of the pre-treatment process sinceCOD, TSS and turbidity were substantially reduced. This led to almost negligible fouling,no clogging and no reduction in ammonia transfer during the operation of the membranecontactor for the pre-treated centrate.Membranes 2022, 12, 1251 13 of 19Membranes 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 20    Figure 5.

Economic Analysis3.6.1. Economic Feasibility of Membrane Contactor ImplementationFigure 6 illustrates the economic balance of implementing a membrane contactorsystem to recover ammonia from the anaerobic digester centrate. The results show thatmembrane contactor implementation in a WWTP led to a negative NPV. Ammoniacal nitro-gen recovery from the anaerobic digester centrate allows (i) achieving revenues from theammonium nitrate fertilizer produced and (ii) reducing the nitrogen load to the mainstreamof the WWTP with a direct impact on energy consumption. However, these revenues didnot offset the additional costs associated with the construction and operation of the differ-ent process units. From these results, it is conceivable to state that further improvementsare still necessary to make nitrogen recovery through membrane contactors economi-cally attractive. Besides economic considerations, ammoniacal nitrogen recovery from theanaerobic digester centrate has the potential to reduce disturbances in the mainstreamnitrification–denitrification process and improve the WWTP effluent quality [52,53].Membranes 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 20    Figure 6. Gross cost, revenues and net present value for the nitrogen recovery scenario under study. The membrane contactor system was the costliest process (55%), followed by aeration (36%) and coagulation–flocculation (9%) (see Figure S2A of the Supplementary Infor-mation). The high cost of the membrane contactor system is mainly associated with the intensive consumption of HNO3 and, to a lesser extent, NaOH. In this regard, chemical consumption features the highest cost contribution, representing 57% of the gross cost (Figure S2B of the Supplementary Information). Energy consumption also represents an important fraction of the gross cost (34.1%), which can be attributed to the high energy requirements of the air blower system. These results highlight that chemical consumption and aeration requirements are two important operational factors influencing the economic competitiveness of the system. 3.6.2. Sensitivity Analysis Figure 7 shows the sensitivity analysis for a ± 30% variation of the main economic parameters. The results illustrate that the NH4NO3 price featured the highest impact on the NPV. This is particularly important considering that the cost of fertilizers is expected to increase in the future due to the progressive increase in fuel and electricity costs [54]. To better understand how NH4NO3 price impacts the economic balance of the system, a sensitivity analysis was conducted for NH4NO3 prices between 0.30 and 0.70 EUR/kg (Fig-ure 8). The results show that the NPV of ammoniacal nitrogen recovery increased from EUR −350,000 to 300,000 as the NH4NO3 price increased from 0.30 to 0.70 EUR/kg, respec-tively. This implies that a positive NPV was achieved at NH4NO3 prices above 0.52 EUR/kg. Overall, these results highlight that the commercialization of the produced NH4NO3 fertilizer has the potential to make membrane contactor configuration economi-cally feasible. i r 6.

This reinforces the idea that chemical consumption and aeration re-quirements are two important aspects influencing the economics of this configuration. Conversely, membrane purchase cost variation did not lead to important changes in the NPV. The low impact of the membrane purchase cost on NPV can be attributed to the high Km coefficient (1.04 × 10−5 m/s) achieved in this study, which is substantially higher than in other studies [5,55]. However, it is worth mentioning that the Km could be sub-stantially lower during long-term membrane contactor operation due to organic and in-organic membrane fouling development on the membrane surface.

However, asharp decrease in the NPV was observed at Km values below 1 × 10−6 m/s. These resultshighlight that Km could have a large influence on the economic balance due to its impacton the membrane requirements of the system. For this reason, it is important to lookfor suitable physical and chemical cleaning strategies able to achieve effective control oflong-term membrane fouling without excessive consumption of chemicals and energy.4. ConclusionsThis study evaluated the implementation of C/F and aeration pre-treatments prior toa membrane contactor stage to recover nitrogen from the anaerobic digester centrate. Theresults revealed that dosing aluminium sulphate at 30 mg Al/L was the best strategy for thecoagulation process. The maximum COD, turbidity and TSS removals (58 and 95 and 90%,respectively) were achieved with a mixing speed of 100 rpm, a mixing time of 5 min and asettling time of 30 min. The flocculation stage using Fe3O4(s)/SiO2(s) (30–70% (w/w)) didnot lead to noticeable improvements in the removal efficiencies. The aeration stage reducedHCO3− content up to 51% and increased the pH up to 9, without the addition of externalchemicals. Subsequently, the effluent from the C/F and aeration stages was fed to themembrane contactor for nitrogen recovery. The membrane contactor recovered 67% of TANand achieved a concentration factor in the acid solution of 3.8. Finally, the techno-economicevaluation showed that the combination of C/F, aeration and membrane contactor has thepotential to be an economically competitive alternative for nitrogen recovery.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/membranes12121251/s1; Table S1: Initial conditions for coagulantselection; Table S2: Flocculation parameters; Figure S1: Schematic representation of the nitrogenrecovery scheme; Table S3: Main flow data for the nitrogen recovery scenario under study; Table S4:Main design parameters used for the economic evaluation; Table S5: Main economic parameters usedfor the economic evaluation; Table S6: Experiment sets of Design Expert 11 software; Figure S2: Grosscost contribution of the nitrogen recovery scenario under study for: (A) the different processes and (B)for the different capital and operating costs.
