Given the global commercial recession of 2014, it is not clear whether Woolworths’ marketing strategy is changing or how has Woolworths designed its marketing mix strategy to fit the consequences of the recession. The aim of this study is to assess the marketing mix strategy of Woolworths Company and offer solutions to future problems. This study is therefore centred on the marketing mix strategies that Woolworths has created to achieve the company’s aims and objectives. Woolworths was started in 1981 by Max Sonnenberg. Max believed that “success was in providing consumers with superior quality products at reasonable prices”. This being a significant factor which has influenced the manner Woolworths brands itself as a key retail outlet in South Africa. Furthermore, this sets Woolworths apart from other retail giants operating in South Africa. The company has an exceptional brand position which attracts the business of upper income customers with the living standards measure (LSM) categories 9 and 10 in terms of food and clothing. In addition, it is a highly desired shopping place for customers who seek LSM 7 and 8.  The prominent research question was how Woolworths managed to provide quality products at reduced prices. The study adopted a case study approach to investigate the research question. Findings from the study point out that Woolworths made some changes during the period of commercial recession. It was ascertained that Woolworths had created innovative ways to circumvent the consequences of recession, they achieved this by increasing stock orders, which has resulted in a decreased pro-rata price per item, and the discounted rates could be directly relayed to consumers. Woolworth’s strong relationship with its suppliers and managing logistics was a task that required efficiency and expertise. It was further observed that Woolworths avoided erratic responses to the economic downturn with applied constructed adjustments to their strategies to achieve its goals.  Finding from the research projects is envisaged to give intellectual contribution through identifying forthcoming trials which are faced by the marketplace arrangement, and recognizing resolutions. 1  CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 1. Introduction  This chapter introduces the research study by looking at the research background, problem statement, the aims and objectives of the study. It will further look at the literature review on thematic headings in the study, and conclude with the research design, research methodology, sampling techniques, ethical consideration, validity and reliability. 1.1 Background of the study  Economic crisis is a state in which the economy of a country experiences a sudden downturn created by a financial crisis. Countries faced with economic crisis will normally experience falling GDPs, reduction in liquidity and rising/falling prices due to inflation (Fosu and Naude 2009:5). Naturally, the recent global economic downturn is traceable to the United States of America. “In the year 2007, the country was faced by a liquidity crisis that emanated from the collapse of housing credit financing” (Baxter, 2009:105). “In 2008, the downturn reached critical levels, characterised by vehement downward fluctuations in the stock markets with significantly low economic growth and fickle exchange rates” (UNCTAD Secretariat, 2009:5-6). The result was a decline in industrial production and international trade in the USA. “Due to globalization, the crisis rapidly spilled over to many developing countries through reduction in trade finance and a slowdown in bilateral trade flows” (UNCTAD Secretariat, 2009:6). “Most developing countries rely heavily on economic markets; hence, the decline in demand from the latter due to crisis inevitably had a detrimental effect on the former. Thus, the negative effects of the economic crisis in the developing world were seemed to be evident through falling commodity prices, declining remittances and demand driven drops in exports (UNCTAD Secretariat, 2009:6). “Within the African continent and amongst developing countries, South African economy is by far the most integrated into the global economy” (Marumoagae, 2014: 380). The South African economy is relatively small but very open in transaction with other countries. The economy relies on international trade as well as attracting foreign investments to sustain its domestic investment, thus making it highly vulnerable to the 2  impacts of global economic crisis (Baxter, 2009:112). The effects of the global economic crisis on South Africa has been the slowdown in vital export markets, 1reduced capital flows and lower commodity prices and key sectors that have strongly been affected by the global economic crisis in South Africa include the automotive, mining and retail sectors (Baxter, 2009:112).   The retail sector in South Africa is quite dynamic, based on statistics by Stats SA (2009). They reported that “the retail sector is one of the highest economic contributors in South Africa accounting for 13.4% of the total GDP of the country” (2009:7). However, the global economic crisis has not spared the retail sector. The global economic crisis brought several challenges to the retail sector, thus challenging retailers to rethink their marketing plans to sustain their organizations whilst ensuring profitability. One South African retailer that bore the brunt of the crisis is Woolworths (Mills, 2011:78). During this period, Woolworths lost a significant percentage of its market share to its competitors like Pick n Pay, Spar and Shoprite. Statistics showed that during this period, consumers limited their supermarket visits and opted for efficient and convenient stores. To retain and gain back market share, Woolworths had to renovate its stores and ensure easy accessibility by consumers (Woolworth 2009:15).  Furthermore, the crisis demanded revision of their existing marketing strategy to reach a larger audience thereby becoming competitive in the market. In response to the global economic crisis, Woolworths formulated an adapted marketing mix strategy. “A marketing mix is a promotional tool that has stood the test of time and proven to be effective” (Kotler, 2015:127). It focuses on four variables which are product, price, promotion and place. The implementation of the marketing mix by Woolworths has seen it recover and on its way to gain a larger market share. 1.2 Research Problem  Given the pending concerns of the global commercial recession of 2014, it is not clear whether Woolworths’ marketing strategy is changing or how it has designed its marketing mix strategy to align itself with the consequences of the recession. Whether Woolworths have altered its marketing mix strategy or its marketing strategy remains the same, the main key point is to discover what adjustments they have made and how they were implemented. All customers need food since it is a necessity, hence 3  they do not hesitate to buy food. In addition, customers often change where they usually buy to suit their buying behaviour, which is affected by many things. It is thus vital for Woolworths to prepare a sound marketing mix strategy to change customers’ perceptions on Woolworths and create a good image in the mind of the consumers. In the retail industry there is a lot of uncertainty hence Woolworths ought to consider flexibility in developing the marketing mix strategy to contest in the unpredictable market challenges. Consumers should be able to acknowledge the value in Woolworths’ products as top of the range. According to Singh (2016:30), “customers have been laying complaints regarding professional services rendered by customer care department and products not meeting the perceived value. Woolworths should thus strategize to keep up with its standards despite the recession”. The aim of this study is to assess the marketing mix strategy of Woolworths Company and offer solutions to future problems. The study centres on the marketing mix strategies created and implemented to pursue company’s aims and objectives. This research project thus offers the intellectual premise on forthcoming trials which are faced by the marketplace arrangement with prescribed and recognized resolutions.  This research project serves as steppingstone for future investigations on commercial recession by academics and businesspeople alike. Investigating Woolworths as one of the biggest retail firms in this study brings quality data that will be amassed from marketing managers who possess some experience. Discoveries from these experts will be valuable to both the academic and the businesses fraternities. A key benefit which comes with this study is the combined data which can be utilised and added to the body of vision, besides, primary research data ascertained from the research will contribute to the body of existing information on the subject matter, since the issue under investigation has not been fully explored in the KwaZulu-Natal Province of South Africa. 1.3 Aim of the study The research project aims to assess the marketing mix strategies adapted by Woolworths in response to the global economic crisis. 1.4 Research Questions 1. Is Woolworths changing its marketing mix strategy to adapt to the global economic crisis? 4  2. If so, what are the changes that Woolworths made to the 4Ps? 3. How were these changes implemented in the marketing mix strategy? 4. What recommendations can be forwarded from the Woolworths case to other retail sector businesses? 1.5 Research Objectives 1. To investigate if Woolworths changed its marketing mix strategy to adapt to the global economic crisis 2. To investigate what changes did Woolworths make to the 4Ps 3. To identify how these changes were made 4. To offer recommendations to other retail sector businesses 1.6 Delimitations of the Study This study focuses on marketing mix strategy adaptation in response to global economic crisis at Woolworths in KZN, using a case study approach. It does not investigate responses to the economic crises by the general retail sector in South Africa, as it makes specific reference to Woolworths in KZN, which, by extension, covers the corporation at South African national level. In other words, since Woolworths operates across all nine provinces in South Africa, their business management strategies, including the marketing strategy, are developed for the corporation nationally and then implemented in individual outlets. Thus this research deals only with Woolworths and not the entire retail business.  1.7 Literature Review 1.7.1 The global economic crisis According to Kotler and Armstrong (2004:15) Global market changes are constantly occurring. Over time the shift has been noted from simple domestic trade to sophisticated international trade. This is due to better transportation systems, good communication channels and minimal trade obstacles; and international trade which was once regarded as luxury has become a requisite in many industries. These authors go on to claim that “the advent of globalisation has expanded the horizons for doing business and opened new channels that allow organizations to carry out business in multiple countries” (2004:17). In as much as globalisation has brought about many benefits, it has also brought a significant level of risk to economies. “To a certain extent, globalisation has produced 5  a domino effect in which the collapse of one market inevitably brings negative impacts on other economies linked to it. This is due to the nature of the monetary market” (Werner, 2014:120).  The global economic downturn/crisis is a typical example of the domino effect in globalised economies. According to Mills (2009:60), the global economic downturn is “a crisis in the financial sector and the financial markets”.   The global economic downturn/crisis originated from the collapse of America’s housing financial system. “The financial system became vulnerable because of the sophisticated and over-leveraged financial dealings. The downturn did not only affect the banking and credit systems but had a domino effect to monetary markets, forex trading, equity funds, public finance and other various sectors” (Frumkin, 2004:50). Furthermore, “the downturn spread to other countries and affected several economic sectors. The retail sector was heavily affected by the downturn. In response, most retail organizations modified their strategies to meet consumer needs which changed in response to the economic crisis” (Kotler and Armstrong 2014: 97-98). Prior to the global economic crisis, South Africa was enjoying an era characterised by rapid economic expansion, however the crisis exposed vulnerable sectors within the economy and created inflation. “There was a notable decrease in the monetary value of houses and a reduction in vehicle sales. Moreover; power shortages erupted with recurring blackouts. The unstable political frontier caused by the resignation of President Mbeki further worsened the economic situation in the country” (Finance 24, 2010:11). Some of the key sectors that felt the brunt of the global economic downturn include the mining, automotive and retail sectors.  1.7.2 South Africa retail sector  The South African economy is made up of various sectors. Some of the key economic sectors include the banking, agriculture, education, engineering, health, manufacturing and retail sectors (Stats SA, 2009:19). The retail sector in South Africa is dynamic and constantly evolving. “It is a vital sector of the economy in terms of transactions and turnover. In terms of employment opportunities, the retail sector is the largest employer in the country, it ranked third in terms of contribution to the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) of the country, contributing 18.2% of the GDP in 2008” (Stats SA.2009:19).  6  “The retail market in South Africa is growing and has a population of over 46 million people, the sector is supported by modern infrastructure that allows for effective and efficient distribution system of goods. In addition, the financial, legal and energy sectors in South Africa are well-established to promote retail operations” (Mills, 2009:62). The retail sector in South Africa comprises of a plethora of organizations and offers a wide range of products. It comprises of relatively sophisticated retail outlets such as Shoprite-Checkers, Pick n Pay, Spar, Woolworths and Clicks. It also consists of wholesale outlets, convenience stores, traditional stores, general dealers, forecourts, spaza shops and tuck-shops. These provide differing levels of convenience and accessibility to the consumers. “Although the retail market is quite broad, the major supermarkets account for over 54% of retail transactions countrywide” (Mills, 2009: 63). “The major retail stores and franchised stores stock both local and imported food products thus giving consumers more choices, however, only 10% of the products are imported” (Stats SA 2009:20). During the economic crisis in South Africa, “Woolworths lost a certain percentage of its customer segment to middle-low income retail outlets including Spar, Pick n Pay and Shoprite. Due to the tough economic environment at the time, consumers were not frequenting supermarkets as much, instead they resorted to shopping at cheaper and convenient stores. This phenomenon characterised with consumer demand for convenience drove Woolworths to modify their supermarkets to position them in accessible locations” (Woolworths 2009:17). The marketing division of the company came up with new strategies that ensured consumers good quality products for good value for money (Woolworths 2009:18). “Considering that Woolworths mainly catered for high income consumers, the economic downturn coupled with a competitive marketplace, pushed Woolworths to alter its marketing strategy to reach a broader target market” (Mills 2009:62). The competitive retail marketplace in South Africa has generally resulted in innovative marketing strategies by organizations. “Epoch of economic crisis in South Africa saw many companies close their doors due to bankruptcy hence to survive recession times. Companies need sound marketing strategies that are effective than their competitors” (Mills 2009: 63). 7  1.6.3 Woolworths’ Competitors There are several retail stores that compete for the market share with Woolworths. The two major competitors are Pick n Pay and Shoprite. Pick n Pay Group is regarded amongst the largest retail stores in the African continent. They retail food, clothes and general goods.  “In South Africa alone, Pick n Pay holds 40% of the market share for the food retail sector” (Corporate Research Foundation, 2014: 22). Pick n Pay Retails Pick n Pay branded products and other brands. “In the year 2006, Pick n Pay extended its market share through acquisition of Fruit & Vegetable City stores, a retailer that already owned several corporate and franchise stores countrywide” (Corporate Research Foundation, 2014:22). Similarly, Shoprite Holdings Ltd has approximately 40% market share in South Africa. The group has several entities that operate with varying names including Checkers and Usave. Other retail stores that form part of Shoprite Holdings include OK, House and Home, Megastore and Hungry Lion. “The Group focuses on middle to low income consumer markets” (Business Report, 2009:14). It is in the face of such a competitive marketplace and economic downturn that Woolworths had to come up with an effective marketing strategy to increase its market share and ultimately its profitability.  Marketing Strategy in Changing Environments According to Ferrell and Hartline (2011:62) “the marketplace is always evolving, hence the need for management to identify the changes and formulate strategies to deal with the changes”. Hooley, Piercy and Nicouland (2014:35) have also indicated that marketing strategies should be a response to changes in product positioning. “It should therefore meet the needs of the target group. Moreover, success in the changing market is a result of utilization of proactive strategies therefore organizations should adopt these” (Hooley et. al, 2014:35). Proactive marketing enables organizations to create opportunities out of challenges, for instance, “…organizations that view recession as an opportunity will look for market opportunities and solutions that allow them to benefit from the recession. While other organizations are hesitant and crippled by fear of financial losses during the recession, 8  proactive organizations invest in brand marketing. This ultimately contributes to their overall success even in the face of economic downturn” (Hooley et. al, 2014:37). During the economic downturn, it is crucial for businesses develop newer and alternative marketing strategies that respond to changes in the marketplace, aggressive competition and changing consumer purchasing patterns. “Marketing strategies that are developed as a reaction to such changes are called adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies aim to maintain brand positioning of an organization until the market conditions improve” (Nystrom 1979:2).   1.6.4 The marketing mix strategy According to Kotler (2015:127), “a successful marketing strategy is based on a marketing mix that truly reflects the desires of the target consumers”. “Marketing mix refers to the set of tools or actions that a company utilizes to promote its brand or product thus influencing sales” (Kotler 2015:128). Marketing mix is amongst the most popular and commonly used strategies in marketing as it blends integral variables encountered in product marketing. Four components that make up the marketing mix include place, promotion, product and price. “These components can be tailor-made to complement the objectives of an organization. It therefore becomes important for an organization to carry out strategic planning and interconnect the organizational marketing strategy with consumer demands” (Kotler, 2015:128).          9  Figure 1.1: The Marketing mix   Source: (Kotler, 2015:23)  1.6.4.1 Product The main component of the marketing mix is the product mix. In the absence of a product, marketing ceases to exist. Kotler and Armstrong (2016: 204) define a product as “anything that can be offered to a market for attention, acquisition, use or consumption that might satisfy a want or a need’’.  Kotler (2015:24) has also defined a product as “a bundle of utilities, consisting of various product features and accompanying services”.  A product is an organization’s offer to the market place. A product should be able to satisfy the needs of the consumer. “The needs satisfied can range from comfort to simple psychological satisfaction experienced by the consumer through consumption or use of the product. Products can be tangible or intangible” (Kotler and Armstrong 2014:204).  Since product is the most important aspect of the marketing mix, “marketers must invest energy in structuring a sound marketing strategy that clearly explains the value of the product to the market. Some of the key aspects of product mix include the product design, range, quality, packaging, branding and after sale services” (Kotler TARGET MARKET Product Price Promotion place 10  and Armstrong 2014:204). Once combined properly, these variables can be a recipe for market success of any product. 1.6.4.2 Price The price is the second variable in the marketing mix.  According to Kotler (2015:33), “Price is the amount of money charged for a product or service, or the sum of the values that consumers exchange for the benefits of having or using the product or service.” “Other aspects of the marketing mix such as product and promotion involve spending money, whilst the pricing aspect is the only variable that generates revenue for the organization” (Dominici, 2009:19). Appropriate pricing is therefore a prerequisite for any organization. Pricing is a critical decision area that affects both the market demand of the product as well as the profitability of an organization (Kotler, 2015:33) “Several factors are considered in determining the prices of products and these include the target market, production cost, market competition, government regulations on pricing and price elasticity of demand” (Kotler, 2015:33). 1.6.4.3 Promotion A product is only as good as its promotion. “An exceptional product with the right pricing cannot achieve market acceptance and success without proper promotional strategy.  The potential consumer must be made aware of the product features, it benefits and pricing through promotion” (Kotler and Armstrong, 2016:41). This makes promotion an equally important aspect of the marketing mix. Promotion is defined as “a process of communication that informs, influences and persuades a potential consumer to buy a product or service” (Dominici, 2009:19).   There is a plethora of methods that can be used in promoting products and these “…include advertising, personal selling, publicity, trade fairs, exhibition and sales promotion” (Beamish and Ashford, 2009:103). “The platforms allow for the provision of information to potential customers thereby arousing interest on the product. In the last decades, the proliferation of internet has greatly contributed in product promotion. Effective promotion strategies consider the budget, timing, media type and ensures that the effectiveness of the promotional methods is evaluated and adjusted when needs be” (Beamish and Ashford, 2009:103).  11  1.6.4.4 Place The fourth element of the product mix is the place also known as physical distribution. “An outstanding product, with good pricing coupled by effective promotion will be a waste if it is not transported from the production site to the place of consumption at the right time. Essentially, products are manufactured for consumer consumption therefore they must be availed to the consumers at convenient locations” (Kotler, 2015:33). “Place or distribution activities offer additional value to the products by generating time, distance and possession utilities. Some of the key considerations in the place mix include distribution channels, shipping, and warehousing and inventory control” (Kotler, 2015:33). When combined and applied appropriately, the four elements of the marketing mix are “a formidable force in achieving the desired levels of success by any organization” (Beamish and Ashford, 2009:106). However, it is also important for organizations to “constantly evaluate and revise the marketing mix to maintain profitability in changing marketing environments. Consumer needs and preferences are constantly evolving which affects the marketing environments.  Revision of the marketing mix thus allows organizations to retain and attract new customers hence thriving even in the face of economic crisis” (Beamish and Ashford, 2009:106). 1.7 Research Design According to Creswell (2015:4) “research design represents a design that is utilized to answer questions”. Yin (2014:13) states that “a research design provides a rational sequence to a researcher that will generate a connection to the aims and goals, inquiries of a study which will lead to the conclusions”. This study’s research design is in the form of a case study. Silverman (2011:16) states that a “Case study mentions to a research on an arrangement confined in space and period and implanted in a specific physical and sociocultural context”. “A case study involves studying phenomena across methodical research of an individual situation” (Cooper and Schindler 2012:212).  The case study technique “…depends on the fact that across such methodical research, generalizations can be utilized for supplementary cases that are comparable to the one under investigation. It offers a chance to examine the connection amongst countless aspects of data” (Cooper and Schindler 2012:218). “Case studies give 12  regard for specificity, eliminations and completeness of the study. It is functional after searching for outlines of associations’ actions inside each marketplace nature” (Cooper and Schindler 2012:218). A qualitative research strategy was utilized to gather data, making use of in-depth interviews to obtain data for this study. 1.7.1 Research methodology Creswell (2015:3) states that “…A qualitative study is structured by employing words and is entrapped by employing open concluded inquiries”. This research is qualitative in nature. “Qualitative research method allows prominence on processes and meanings that are not carefully examined and measured in words of number, quantity or intensity” (Cooper and Schindler 2012:215). In addition, qualitative approach “can adapt to the quality of data that is being collected” (Struwig and Stead 2013:52). “If the available data does not seem to be providing any results, the research can immediately shift the direction and framework of research to be revised quickly as fresh findings emerge. This provides more opportunities to collect vital clues about any subject instead of being narrowed to a limited and often self-fulfilling perspective. Moreover, qualitative research embraces the gut instinct as it is based on human experiences and observations and the data that can be collected is often better for it” (Yin 2014: 13). 1.7.2 Sampling Method According to Look, Leedy, Tomich and Bayraktaglou (2010: 212), “when a target population is diverse a sample to represent the total target population should be chosen”. Sekaran (2003:16) also alludes that “sampling is a procedure of choosing a representative part from the target population. In non-probability sampling the representative part is chosen depending on the subjective judgement of the researcher rather than random selection” (Carmo, Infante and Mendes, 2014: 478). Purposive non- probability sampling provides the chance of selection for each element in a population which is unknown and for some elements is zero. Winn et.al (2011:236) supports the idea that “purposive non- probability sampling is an ideal sampling method when developing interview schedule, exploration and theory development”. The sample was selected amongst higher management within the company based on their job responsibilities, position and involvement in the subject. In this research, eight (8) respondents were selected from Woolworths’ head office in 13  Durban City Centre to provide a wide understanding of the research problem, as well as to widen the accuracy of feedback given. 1.7.3 Data collection In-depth interview was employed to collect data from the participants. In-depth interview refers to “…an interview which is conducted with people whose knowledge on a subject matter or a phenomenon will shed substantial light on the matter being investigated”, according to Stacks (2017:196) Stacks (2017:196) goes on to observe that “in-depth interviews offer rich detail and the skill to understand the thoughts of the interviewee about the subject and adding the interviewer’s insight and opinions to enhance data”. Moreover, in-depth interviews provide the interviewer with understanding of both the problem being researched and the interviewee. In addition, “in-depth interviews allow for introspection on the part of the interviewee and can also allow the interviewer to keep control over the type and order of the interview questions and keeping the interviewee on the most important questions” (Sismanoglou and Tzimitra-Kalogianni 2011:171). According to (Weiss 1994:115), “it is vital to contemplate on the questions when creating an interview guide”.  1.7.4 Data Analysis The researcher examines and analyses the data collected from the respondents via thematic analysis. Vaismoradi et.al, (2013:398) state that “thematic analysis emphasizes discovering, scrutinizing and record themes across data sets that are critical to the description of a phenomenon for a specific analysis question”. In addition, “…thematic analysis is a data analysis method that identifies and analyse patterns of meaning in a dataset” (Farr and Moscovici 2004:143).  Thematic analysis was utilized because it illustrates themes that are important in the description of the phenomenon being researched. Moreover, “it highlights the most salient constellations of meanings present in the dataset” (Farr and Moscovici 2004:143). It also highlights the most noticeable collection of meanings presented in the data set. According to Braun (2013:78), “thematic analysis enables the collection of knowledge of the meaning made of the phenomenon being researched or studied and offers the needed ground work for creating effective models of human thinking, sensitivity and behaviour. This method of analysis holds both the prevalence of significant themes, without forgoing the depth of analysis. 14  1.7.5 Validity and Reliability Validity deals with the extent to which a set of data is considered credible, believable, trustworthy and reliable. Bonds-Raacke and Raacke (2012:84) claim that “validity is the skill of the researcher’s measurement instrument to precisely compute what it is hypothetical to measure”. “Reliability represents the productivity of stable aftermath of a measurement under the same conditions” (Leedy and Omrod 2010:93).  “Qualitative researchers must salvage the obligation for reliability and validity by requesting strategies, integral across the conduct of the study” (Kothari 2005:45). The researcher approved the concept of dependability which is a word that corresponds to the notion of reliability. The consistence of data was attained after the steps of the study were confirmed across examination of such items as raw data, data reduction analysis and interview notes. 1.7.6 Ethical Considerations Neuman (2011:33) states that “moral and professional responsibilities should be guided through ethics despite participants’ awareness of it”. The researcher was prudent and subtle of the replies across the sequence of data collection and fieldwork. The researcher further safeguarded truth, uprightness and respected the opinion of respondents ‘across the research process with the intention to create honesty in the research. The researcher also ensured the autonomy of respondents to leave at any period from the research process, without causing harm either to themselves or to the study results. These ethics were followed to give procedures to the researcher in relation to the participant’s privileges across the study.   The researcher applied for ethical clearance from the University of KwaZulu-Natal, and obtained the gatekeeper’s letter from Woolworths Company to conduct the interviews at Durban Woolworths Head Office.  1.8 Outline of the study The study is structured as follows: Chapter One: Introduction; Chapter one outlines the introduction of this study, aim of the study, objectives, the problem statement and the methodology. 15  Chapter Two: Literature Review: This chapter reviews related literature on the concepts from the insight of other authors regarding the economic crisis, the marketing mix, the retail sector and Woolworths as a retailer.

The significance of the study was also discussed. That chapter also outlined the aim, objectives, research methodology and delimitations of this study. Chapter two will cover the literature review of this study. This review of literature discovered a gap in investigating effective and efficient marketing mix strategy adaptation in response to the global economic crisis at Woolworths in KwaZulu-Natal. Prior researches focused on one or more tools or have studied marketing mix strategies in different industries or specified cases of the retail industry. This chapter reviews literature on the concepts, arguments, developments and findings from the insight of different scholars and researchers about the marketing mix, the global economic crisis, effects of growth and inflation, South African retail sector, Woolworths’ competitors and the marketing strategy in changing environments. The chapter ends with a conclusive note. 2.2 The global economic crisis The global market is constantly changing. According to Kotler and Armstrong (2016:15), “over time there has been a notable gradual shift from simple domestic trade to sophisticated international trade.”  In the face of better transportation systems, good communication channels and minimal trade obstacles, international trade has become a requisite in many sectors yet was once regarded as a luxury. The advent of globalization has expanded the horizons for doing business and opened new channels that enable organizations to carry out business in multiple countries”. In as much as globalization has brought about many benefits, “it has also brought a significant level of risk to economies. To some extent, globalization has produced a domino effect in which the collapse of one market inevitably impacts negatively on other economies linked to it, which is due to the nature of the monetary market” (Werner, 2014:120).  The global economic downturn/crisis is a typical example of the domino effect in globalized economies. According to Mills (2009:60) the global economic recession refers to “a disaster in the financial sector and the financial 17  markets”. “This global economic crisis was born from the collapse of America’s housing financial system. The financial system became vulnerable because of the sophisticated and over-leveraged financial dealings” (Mills 2009:60).  “The downturn impacted the banking systems, monetary markets, forex trading, equity funds, public finance and various other sectors” (Frumkin, 2004:50). Furthermore, “the downturn spread to other countries as it affected several economic sectors, including the retail sector which was also heavily affected by the downturn. However most retail organizations modified their strategies to meet consumer needs that also changed as an adaptation to the economic crisis” (Kotler and Armstrong 2014:97). Prior to the global economic crisis, South Africa was enjoying an era characterised by rapid economic expansion, however the crisis exposed vulnerable sectors within the economy and created inflation. “There was a notable decrease in the monetary value of houses and a reduction in vehicle sales. Moreover; power shortages erupted with recurring blackouts. The unstable political frontier caused by the resignation of President Mbeki further worsened the economic situation in the country” (Finance 24, 2010:10). Some of the key sectors that felt the brunt of the global economic downturn include the mining, automotive and retail sectors. “A struggling economy creates its own downward spiral fearing worse days ahead, with consumers and businesses become very careful about using money hence spending less, with demand for products also dropping immensely” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:74). In other instances, “less demand compels employers to take astonishing steps just to stay in business thereby reducing working time salaries or their work force.  During a downturn a marketer needs to stress value in their products, some cut their prices or offer sales promotion to assist consumers stretch their budget” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:74). Furthermore, markets need to reconsider their approaches and concentrate on favorable products, however, they need to perceive how customers used to reduced prices and sales promotions will respond when the economic crisis is over” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:75). Over and above this, “during times of global economic crisis unemployment increases thus declining customers’ buying power. When a customers’ buying power decline they become more price conscious and value sensitive, hence, they look for basic affordable products” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:77). Also, “in such situations, marketers 18  should not reduce their marketing efforts since it damages their survival, rather they must consider changing their marketing strategies because customers are more worried about the functionality of the product. Marketers should escalate their marketing research to ascertain factors that influence consumer’s buying behaviors. Their promotional significance should highlight value and utility”, as alluded to by Hurt, Pride and Ferrell (2010:65). In addition, some of the global economic crisis results are discussed below. 2.2.1 Resource shortages Resource shortages, either permanent or temporary, result from numerous conditions, including lack of raw materials or labor etc. According to Kurtz and Boone (2012:76), “the global economic crisis attached with adverse weather conditions like drought signals the likelihood of food shortages. When there is a shortage, it is essential to de-market to reduce the demand for the product to a level that the company can manage its supply. This can happen even in developed countries as well. “During the period of shortage, marketers have a challenge, they have either to share limited supplies or apply different marketing strategies from the traditional marketing with the aim of increasing sales volume” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:76). “Marketers must decide whether to spread the limited supplies over all customers, or limit purchase by some customers, so that the company can totally satisfy others” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:76).  2.2.2 Effects on growth and inflation “Economic growth is vital for development even if it is not a perfect indicator of progress” (Fosu and Naudé, 2009:81). “In the early stages of the economic crisis, there was the view that the effect on African countries would be low possibly because of their low integration into the global economy. However, presently, there is significant proof of the negative impact of the crisis in the continent. The crisis caused serious obstacles for African countries because it happened at a time when the region was making developments in economic performance and management” (Fosu and Naudé 2009:81).  “The impact of the global crisis came on the heels of the food and fuel price shocks of 2007-08. The growth of the global economy that was average 4.1% drastically dropped after the beginning of the crisis in 2008” (Truman 2009:70). “The unanticipated drop in African economic growth rate has scared the prospect of the 19  region to meet one of the Millennium Development Goals of splitting the number of people living on less than one dollar a day. It is projected that African countries must have economic growth of around 7% per annum to meet this goal however, none of the countries have its economy growing at this percentage and the percentage change of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita which became worse in 2009 exacerbated the situation” (Fosu and Naudé 2009:82).  “The decline in economic growth rate has been blamed on the direct drop in export demand and tourism revenues, decreasing product prices, decrease in the availability of credit and trade finance, fewer inflows of payments, private portfolio movements and foreign direct investment” (Ratha and Xu 2008:54). Moreover, “factors such as higher unemployment and poverty, increases in infant mortality rates, and adverse coping with long-lasting effects such as higher school drop-out rates, decreases in healthcare, environmental degradation, and political instability cannot be ruled out of the causative factors” (Naude and Fosu, 2009:82). Furthermore, “the global economic slowdown is decreasing the flow of payments to the region as African migrant workers in Europe, North America and the Gulf States are laid off and return home”. Recent data released by the World Bank indicate that the economic crisis has reduced remittance inflows to sub-Saharan Africa by close to between $1 billion and $2 billion dollars in 2009 relative to 2008 (World Bank, 2010:36). 2.2.3 Inflation Inflation is increasing prices caused by combination of extra demand and growth in the costs of raw materials, employees and other factors of production. “It diminishes the value of money by reducing the products it can buy through price rise. The increase in prices also affects marketing expenses thus decreasing sales” (Kurtz and Boone 2012:75). 2.2.4 Effect on commodity prices and trade The economic crisis also has a negative impact on trade in African countries. “There has been a major decline in the prices of main commodities exported by African countries since the second half of 2008. The same author observed that though commodity prices shown an overshooting behavior before the crisis, the current global crisis could not bring the prices to a balanced level. Findings indicate a downward 20  trend in prices of commodity groups (food, fuel, agricultural materials and metal) since the second half of 2008” (Fosu and Naudé 2009:83).  2.3 South Africa retail sector The South African economy is made up of various sectors, some of the key economic sectors include the banking sector, agriculture, education, engineering, health sector, manufacturing and retail sector (Stats SA, 2009:56). The retail sector in South Africa is dynamic and constantly evolving, it is a vital sector of the economy in terms of transaction and turnover. “In terms of employment opportunities, the retail sector is the largest employer in the country. It is ranked third vis-à-vis the role it plays to the Gross Domestic Production (GDP) of the country, contributing 18.2% of the GDP” (Stats SA.2009:56).  “The retail market in South Africa is growing and has a population of over 46 million people. The sector is supported by modern infrastructure which allows for an effective and efficient distribution system of goods” (Mills, 2009:62). In addition, “the financial, legal and energy sectors in South Africa are well-established to facilitate retail operations” (Kotler, 2015:62). The retail sector in South Africa comprises of a plethora of organizations and offers a wide range of products. It comprises of relatively sophisticated retail outlets such as Shoprite-Checkers, Pick n Pay, Spar, Woolworths and Clicks. It also consists of wholesale outlets, convenience stores, traditional stores, general dealers, forecourts, spaza shops and tuck-shops. These provide differing levels of convenience and accessibility to the consumers. “Although the retail market is quite broad, the major supermarkets account for over 54% of retail transactions countrywide” (Mills 2009: 63). “The major retail stores and franchised stores stock both local and imported food products thus giving consumers more choices, however, only 10% of the products are imported” (Stats SA 2009:20). During the economic crisis in South Africa, “Woolworths lost a certain percentage of its customer segment to middle-low income retail outlets including Spar, Pick n Pay and Shoprite. Due to the tough economic environment at the time, consumers were not frequenting supermarkets as much, instead they resorted to shopping at cheaper and convenient stores. This phenomenon characterised with consumer demand for convenience drove Woolworths to modify their supermarkets to position them in 21  accessible locations” (Woolworth 2009). The marketing division of the company came up with new strategies that ensured consumers good quality products for good value for money (Woolworths 2009:33). “Considering that Woolworths mainly catered for high income consumers, the economic downturn coupled with a competitive marketplace, pushed Woolworths to alter its marketing strategy to reach a broader target market” (Mills 2009:62). The competitive retail marketplace in South Africa has generally resulted in innovative marketing strategies by organizations. “Epoch of economic crisis in South Africa saw many companies close their doors due to bankruptcy hence to survive recession times. Companies needs sound marketing strategies that are effective than their competitors” (Mills 2009: 63). 2.4 Woolworths’ Competitors A. The Pick n Pay Group Pick n Pay is a large conglomerate and a serious business concern. According to past research, “The Pick n Pay Group has been one of Africa’s largest retailers of food, clothing and general merchandise for the past three decades. Pick n Pay has 40 percent of the South African retail food sector. The Retail Division manages Pick n Pay branded products such as food, clothing and general merchandise in hypermarkets, Supermarkets, Family Franchise Stores, Mini Markets Franchise, Clothing, Butcheries and Meat Markets, Home Shopping and Gas Centres” (Corporate Research Foundation, 2014:22). “The Group Enterprises Division operates the Group’s other non-Pick n Pay branded Group activities including Score Supermarkets, TM Supermarkets, property franchises, Go banking, as well as finding new investment opportunities for the group worldwide” (Business Standard, 2009: 3). “Pick n Pay has a total number of 706 stores made up of 14 Hypermarkets, 18 Clothing Stores, 115 Score Supermarkets, 57 Boxers, 5 Pick n Pay Auto Centres, 79 Franklins in Australia, and 92 retail stores in stores in the rest of Africa” (Business Standard, 2009:3). “In July 2006 Pick n Pay (South Africa) acquired Fruit & Vegetable City stores. Fruit & Vegetable was established as a family business in 1993 and operates a total of 86 corporate and franchise stores in South Africa. The 86 corporate franchise stores are excluded from the 706 Pick n Pay stores mentioned earlier” (Corporate Research 22  Foundation, 2014:22). Traditionally, “Pick n Pay Score supermarkets have had a presence in townships when other retailers have stayed away. Pick n Pay is the most modest of high-end super market chains” (Business Standard, 2009:4). B. Shoprite Holdings Ltd “Shoprite Holdings Ltd on the other hand has about 40 percent of the market, focusing on the broad middle to lower-end of the market, and include the following entities; the Shoprite Checkers Supermarket Group, which consists of 348 Shoprite supermarkets, 110 Checkers Supermarkets, 24 Checkers Hyper, 92 Usave stores, 20 distribution Centers supplying group stores with groceries, non-foods and perishable lines, 158 OK  Furniture outlets, 13 OK Power Express stores, 27 House & Home stores, and 74 Hungry Lion fast food outlets. Through its OK franchise division, the Group procures and distributes stock to 31 OK minimarket convenience stores, 24 OK Food supermarkets, 52 OK Grocer stores, 59 Megasave wholesale stores and 91 Sentra, Value Stores and buying partners” (Business Report, 2014:33). “Checkers Hyper has a special section devoted entirely to imported foods as well as Kosher, a halaal section. It caters for middle to higher income groups. Price points are also comparable to the United States. Shoprite stores are similar to a super Wal-Mart or a Food Warehouse type of shopping experience. Shoprite have volume growth of 20 percent in the prepared food category. The overall growth of 11 percent in frozen prepared food sales, and meals solutions 8 percent” (Business Report 2009:12)  It was in the face of such a competitive marketplace and economic downturn, that Woolworths had to come up with an effective marketing strategy to increase its market share and profitability. 2.5 Marketing strategy in changing environments According to Ferrell and Hartline (2011:61) the external environment is constantly changing and it is important that management understands these changes and act decisively. Hooley, Piercy and Nicoulaud (2014:35), explain that the “marketing strategy is supposed to develop effective responses to changing positioning product offerings for those target markets’’ Furthermore, to be successful in the market, especially a changing one, an organization has to use proactive strategies” (Hooley, Piercy & Nicouland 2014:35). 23  Proactive marketing can be a tool for any organization to turn challenges into opportunities. “Organizations that view recession as an opportunity attempts to find solutions and gaps in the market. As a result, they invest in marketing when competitors are hesitant and continue to invest, trusting in their brand”. “The opposite is true for organizations that view a downturn as a threat” (Hooley, Piercy & Nicouland, and 2014:37). During the economic downturn, it was crucial for organizations to develop newer marketing strategies, which adapts to the changing environment, fierce competition, and changing consumer buying patterns. A marketing strategy developed in response to such changes is known as an adaptation strategy. T
