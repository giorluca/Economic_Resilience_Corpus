INTRODUCTION
Wastewater is increasingly viewed as a ‘water-carried waste’, 
presenting opportunities for recovery of both nutrients and 
energy. Amongst the sewage-borne resources, phosphorus 
is an important, non-substitutable nutrient for all life forms, 
particularly in the growth of plants, and is therefore essential in 
ensuring universal food security (Liu et al., 2008; Kalmykova 
et al., 2012). Human activities have disturbed the natural 
phosphorus cycle and remain heavily dependent on mining of 
non-renewable rock phosphate. It is estimated that 78% to 90% 
of the global phosphate demand is directly attributed to the 
production of synthetic fertilizers and livestock feed additives in 
the agriculture industry (Liu et al., 2008; Kalmykova et al., 2012).
In tackling the growing global food crisis, it will be 
important to consider the quality and usefulness of the recovered 
phosphate product for potential agricultural use (Schröder, 
et al., 2009). Urine separation and sewage nutrient recovery 
technologies that yield high quality and useful products are being 
explored and implemented globally (Wilsenach, 2003; Ganrot, 
2005; Etter, 2009; Kalmykova et al., 2012). Due to South Africa’s 
sanitation and economic backlogs, it should be in the best 
interest of the South African society to not only treat the access 
to sanitation issue as a high priority, but to also consider the 
employment of such ecologically and economically sustainable 
sanitation solutions to meet future needs, as it strives to meet the 
Sustainable Development Goals.
Industrial and commercial uptake of technologies is 
hindered through inadequate development of problems within 
the technology transfer pipeline. Cultural and geographical 
influences on a technology’s penetration into a new market are 
further complicated by perceived health and social risks, aspects 
of technology development that are often overlooked. Today, 
research has taken a turn to better understand and tackle these 
issues, as is shown by the development of holistic technology 
sustainability assessments demonstrated by Balkema (2002) and 
Muga and Mulchelci (2008). These frameworks are conceptual 
and have been applied to existing nutrient-recovery case studies, 
but are yet to be applied in the prefeasibility step of phosphate 
recovery techniques, let alone in the South African context. The 
need for a more holistic approach, which includes both a social 
and techno-economic assessment of potential technologies, has 
shaped the aims and methodology of our research on phosphate 
recovery (Sikosana et al., 2014).
It was thus an overarching objective of our research to 
determine whether phosphate recovery technologies are likely to 
produce a socially acceptable product and what determines their 
affordability. In this paper, we focus on the latter and present the 
techno-economic analysis of a case study, which demonstrates 
how a nutrient recovery process could be incorporated into a 
biological wastewater treatment works in South Africa. Links 
are made to our earlier social acceptability study (Sikosana 
et.al, 2014), which maps potential market avenues for recovered

ABSTRACT
Phosphate is one of the substances which wastewater treatment works (WWTW) have to lower in order to meet the 
South African regulatory discharge standard of 1 mg/L. Wastewater is increasingly viewed as a ‘water-carried waste’, 
presenting opportunities for resource recovery. South Africa has commenced its transition to a low-carbon and resource-
efficient economy, all whilst it struggles to provide universal access to basic needs and is faced with massive infrastructure 
maintenance as well as upgrading backlogs in the sanitation sector in particular. Although phosphate recovery methods 
exist, there is little evidence to indicate that these techniques would be economically viable or socially accepted in South 
Africa. This paper explores the potential for centralized recovery of nutrients, through the conceptual design and techno-
economic pre-feasibility assessment of two phosphate recovery options, at the largest WWTW in the Western Cape, South 
Africa. This assessment revealed that the digestate stream at the 200 ML/d Cape Flats WWTW (CFWWTW) has the 
potential to produce ~470 kg/d of struvite fertilizer, whilst recovering 4–8% of the plant’s costs in 20 years. When contrasted 
with the more familiar, yet less sustainable, chemical precipitation process, low-grade and high-grade struvite production 
establishment costs are 10 and 25 times higher, respectively. Still, to reduce effluent phosphate loading to within regulated 
standards, the low-grade struvite production option at an estimated net present cost of R25.4 million over a 20-year lifetime 
is more affordable than chemical precipitation at a net present cost of R51.2 million. Low-grade struvite production is 
thus concluded to be technically feasible and the economically most affordable option from a lifecycle-costs perspective. 
Although it is a simple process, it is not cheap. Municipalities will need to consider the lower operating costs, as well as the 
environmental benefit of producing a useful phosphate fertilizer, over the immediate capital investment, if they decide to 
install such an operation.

phosphate – an important factor used to determine both pricing 
and economic viability. 
BACKGROUND
The sludge liquor stream in a biological WWTW with anaerobic 
digestion has been identified as one of the most promising 
points for nutrient recovery (Strom, 2006; Bilyk et al., 2011). In 
the South African context, and more specifically in the Western 
Cape, the 200 ML/d Cape Flats WWTW (CFWWTW) is a 
good example of a treatment facility in which such a phosphate-
enriched stream arises, and forms the basis of this techno-
economic analysis.
Mineral precipitation issues (mostly struvite) experienced 
at the CFWWTW, has led to the poor performance of the 
digestate centrifuge, as well as blockages in the Thermal Drying 
Plant pipeline. Batch dewatering may cause nutrient peaks and 
instability in secondary processes, hence causing effluent nutrient 
spikes and spontaneous struvite precipitation (Bilyk et al., 2011). 
Excess phosphorus in the waste activated sludge (WAS) as well as 
the loss of CO2 (which increases pH) along the sludge treatment 
line, are the main causes of struvite precipitation (Van Rensburg et 
al., 2003). An additional nutrient sink would recover these excess 
nutrients and could mitigate blockages in the anaerobic digester’s 
(AD) sludge centrifuge and pipeline. Therefore, this paper explores 
the technical and economic viability of applying a globally proven 
and advanced crystallisation technology at the CFWWTW to 
address this issue. 
Case studies: Ostara installation at Nansemond Treatment 
Plant (2010); Multiform Harvest at Yakima WWTW (2012)
Ostara installation by Hampton Roads Sanitation District 
(HRDS), at the Nansemond Treatment Plant, Suffolk, Virginia, 
USA, and Multiform Harvest in Yakima WWTW, USA, provide 
commercial scale, crystallisation nutrient recovery technologies. 
Their installations have been shown to successfully treat the 
sludge liquor exiting anaerobic digester units at centralised 
WWTWs.
Ostara’s Pearl Reactor installed at the HRDS Nansemond 
WWTP, Virginia, recovers-excess nutrients to help mitigate 
blockages in the digested sludge pipelines. This full-scale facility 
extracts up to 85% of the excess phosphates, as 1 650 kg/d high-
quality struvite, when operating at a maximum capacity of 416 
m3/d. The struvite is further processed and packaged on site, 
before it is sold by Ostara, under the brand name Crystal Green. 
Similarly, the Multiform Harvest process installed at Yakima’s 
75 ML/d WWTW, comprises of conical fluidized bed reactors. 
Although a recovery of up to 90% of the excess phosphate is 
possible, the lack of a recycle stream and the short retention time 
results in 450 kg/d of wet, powdery and low-grade fertilizer. In 
this case, the 830 kL/d nutrient recovery facility, reduces the 
phosphate concentrations of the WWTW effluent entering the 
Yakima River to curb seasonal eutrophication. The Ostara set-up 
is illustrated in Fig. 1 and the two processes are compared in 
Table 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Engineering economic assessment methods were used to 
investigate the potential for centralized recovery of nutrients, 
through the conceptual design and a techno-economic pre-
feasibility assessment of two phosphate recovery options at 
the largest WWTW in the Western Cape, the CFWWTW. 
The first option considers the recovery of high-grade struvite 
crystals which is based on the Ostara process, whilst the second 
produces a lower grade struvite slurry similar to that achieved by 
Multiform Harvest installations. These options were contrasted 
with the more traditional chemical precipitation process, a 
phosphate removal technique commonly practiced in South 
Africa. During the study, significant fluctuations in process 
operations were observed. Hence, the process model and techno-
economic assessment were based on theoretical plant data and 
literature values pertaining to the CFWWTW. The techno-
economic assessment consisted of the following steps:
Concept design
Concept designs for three phosphate-focused project 
interventions were developed to assess the potential for struvite 
production as a viable side-stream treatment option for the 
CFWWTW. The approach to conceptual design involved:
• Generation of three distinct alternatives, informed by 
the technology review and analysis of global case studies 
presented in Sikosana et al. (2014), as well as knowledge of 
the plant configuration at the CFWWTW
• Development of process flow diagrams and process 
summaries
• Linking the potential products to the market routes 
identified in the South African based market assessment 
described by Sikosana et al. (2014)
Technical assessment (mass and energy balances)
The high-grade struvite, low-grade and phosphorus precipitation 
options (described in more detail in the Results section) were 
then evaluated based on the following key technical criteria 
(summarized in Table 2): 
• Production rate of solid products (kg/d and kg/year)
• Energy use (kWh/d)
• Chemical consumption rates (kg/d)
• Plant land requirements (m²)
• Additional labour requirements (over and above the needs 
for the existing WWTW)
• Additional maintenance requirements (over and above the 
needs for the existing WWTW)
Financial assessment
Based on the struvite production rates and chemical input 
requirements, engineering economic calculations were used to 
evaluate the financial feasibility of struvite production at the 
CFWWTW. The economic viability of struvite production was 
assessed based on the following economic indicators:
• Plant establishment costs: capital expenditure (CAPEX)
• Operating expenditure (OPEX)
• Cost recovery from struvite production (revenue)
• Net present value/net present costs (NPV/NPC) over a 
20-year investment period
Comparison of the three options was made based on the NPV/
NPC values achieved.  The economic assessment criteria used in 
NPV/NPC calculations for all three options are summarized in 
Table 3.

Sensitivity analysis
Various assumptions were made for the baseline techno-
economic evaluation. Therefore, it was necessary to consider to 
what extent variations in process parameters would affect these 
results and how best they could be controlled. The impact of 
various parameters on the NPV costs and, hence, feasibility were 
tested. The most significant parameters were:
• Maintenance costs (as a percentage of CAPEX)
• Retail selling price of struvite fertilizer (high- and low-grade 
struvite)
• CAPEX (all options)
• Discount rate
These parameters, with the exception of sludge disposal, struvite 
selling price and discount rate, were varied over a range from 
−50% to 100% increase and their effects on NPV were compared 
to the base case.
RESULTS 
Technical assessment
Concept design 
The CFWWTW anaerobic digester liquor stream has a 
phosphorus concentration of 89 to 190 mg/L and magnesium 
(Mg) ranging from 29 to 67 mg/L (Van Rensburg et al., 2003), 
as well as a design flow rate of approximately 1 060 m3/d. Table 
4 summarizes the design basis and concept design features for 
all process options. Figure 2 is a process schematic, illustrating 
a high-grade struvite production facility. The low-grade 
struvite and phosphorus precipitation options were designed as 
variations of this process.
Unlike the Ostara process shown in Fig. 2, the Multiform 
Harvest process produces a less refined product (20wt% DS), 
which is collected from the bottom of the reactor in a skip, 
retrofitted with a filter. This skip is collected weekly from the

WWTW and may be further treated off-site before being sold 
to secondary markets. The conical fluidized bed reactors are 
typically smaller than the Ostara installations, with a lower 
retention time, and do not require recirculation pumps. In 
addition, unlike high-grade struvite, no drying or bagging 
equipment is required, which drastically reduces capital costs. 
Technical assessment summary 
At 90% conversion, both the high-grade and low-grade struvite 
options produce approximately 469 kg/d of struvite (on a dry 
basis), recovering 58 kg/d of phosphorus. When packaged 
and dried, this amounts to 510 kg/d (92 wt% dry solids (DS)) 
high-grade struvite and 568 kg/d (80 wt% DS) low-grade (wet) 
struvite. Chemical precipitation results in 242 kg/d of chemical 
sludge (aluminium hydroxide + phosphate) and an additional 
25% suspended solids removal (WEF, 2005), to give 601 kg/d 
of dry sludge. Once mechanically dewatered to 25% dry solids, 
2 400 kg/d excess sludge is to be disposed of. This is an 0.2% 
increase in the overall Cape Flats sludge production. Aluminium 
solution dosage for chemical precipitation is about 2 630 kg/d 
which is 5 times that of the magnesium dosing material required 
for high-grade and low-grade struvite production.
Chemical precipitation generally has a higher energy 
footprint, but only slightly, than that of low-grade struvite 
production (Bilyk et al., 2010). High-grade struvite production 
carries a significant electrical/carbon footprint, which should 
be ignored. The technical assessment of all three options is 
summarised in Table 5.
Link to potential markets 
Expert interviews were conducted in a preceding study by 
Sikosana et al. (2014) to assess the acceptability of phosphate 
fertilizer production from human waste, as well as the potential 
markets within the South African context. Three academic 
experts in struvite production, an organic farming expert, 
an organic farmer, one representative from retail, and one 
representative from the fertilizer industry, as well as two 
representatives from two different organic certification boards, 
were interviewed, giving a total of nine participants.
It is believed by the industry experts that the South African 
organic market is immature and its consumer may not be ready 
for fertilizers produced from human waste, let alone for use 
of these fertilizers in food production. Higher acceptability 
could be experienced within the inorganic fertilizer production 
market, regardless of source, if struvite is proven to be safe and a 
reliable purification process is identified. More feasible markets 
could lie within ornamental plant fertilization, commercial 
fertilizer production and fertilizer use within closed community 
gardens. Therefore, there is potentially a larger market for 
lower-grade struvite. Based on these findings, the possible 
market avenues for high-grade and low-grade struvite, as well as 
chemical precipitation products, determine and differentiate the 
market value of these three process products and the calculations 
to followed.
Economic assessment
At 90% conversion, 470 kg/d of dry struvite can be produced at 
a cost of R22/kg struvite for high-grade and R8.90/kg struvite 
for the unprocessed fertilizer. This production rate recovers 4.2% 
and 8.0% of the operating costs for the low-grade and high-grade 
struvite options, respectively. Chemical precipitation produces 
2 400 kg/d (25 wt% DS) excess sludge for landfill disposal. 
Phosphate removal at the CFWWTW will incur additional 
treatment costs of R0.05, R0.03 and R0.12 per kilolitre to the 
business-as-usual rate, for high-grade struvite, low-grade and 
chemcial precipitation, respectively. In comparison to recovering 
water for reuse at a cost of R7.00/kL and sewage costs at R2.90/
kL, all options come in cheaper than these costs. 
The estimated net present costs are R76.2, R25.4 and R51.1 
million for the high-grade struvite, low-grade struvite, and 
phosphorus precipitation, respectively. Higher operating costs 
due to chemical dosing and sludge disposal amplify the net 
present costs of phosphorus precipitation. The high flow rate to 
phosphate loading ratio makes the high capital cost associated 
with on-site processing of high-grade struvite impractical. 
Despite the higher market value, low production rates of high-
quality struvite will not generate enough revenue to recover the 
cost of production, let alone the investment. Table 6 compares 
the economic viability of all three options.

Sensitivity analysis
The base case techno-economic assessment was calculated using 
approximations, which relied on assumptions, heuristics and 
literature data. Therefore, it is useful to assess the sensitivity of 
this assessment to changes in key parameters. This will account 
for uncertainty in the design criteria and assumptions made. In 
addition, the main design parameters that could positively affect 
the feasibility of the proposed options can be identified.
Comparing high-grade struvite and low-grade struvite
Figure 3 shows the effects of a −50% to 100% increase in selling 
price, CAPEX and related maintenance costs on the NPV for 
both high-grade and low-grade struvite production. Changes 
in high-grade struvite’s CAPEX and maintenance drastically 
influence the NPC. Changes in selling price have very little effect 
on the overall profitability of the plant in both instances. 
Best-case high-grade struvite vs. low-grade struvite
If the municipality were to consider the production of high-
grade struvite over the unprocessed low-grade struvite, key 
process parameters would have to be adjusted to yield an 
NPV within an acceptable cost bracket. In this case, the high-
grade struvite’s NPV is most affected by CAPEX. Thus, if a 
prefabricated Ostara Pearl 2000 reactor is used instead of a 
reactor manufactured to the specific design capacity of the 
CFWWTW, even though it is larger than the required capacity, 
the NPC of the whole installation may be reduced to R48 
million. At best, the high-grade struvite product can be sold at 
R6.60/kg struvite, resulting in an NPC of R41.4 million; which 
would be 1.6 times greater than that of the low-grade option. 
To reduce the cost even further to R32.5 million, maintenance 
costs could be lowered to the business-as-usual option of 
2%. It is evident that unless the phosphate concentration in 
this CFWWTW side stream increases, low-grade struvite 
production, based on the Multiform Harvest design, will always 
come in cheaper than high-grade struvite (Ostara-based design).
Comparing low-grade struvite and phosphorus precipitation
Figure 4 compares the effects of the low-grade struvite and 
chemical precipitation NPCs with the change in chemical dosing 
costs and CAPEX. Chemical dosage costs have the highest 
effect on the phosphorus chemical precipitation NPC, but has 
little effect on that of the low-grade struvite process. However, 
even with a 50% drop in the chemical price for the traditional 
precipitation treatment method, low-grade struvite is still a more 
affordable option for phosphate removal at CFWWTW.
Best-case phosphorus precipitation vs. low-grade struvite
Key process parameters can be changed in a number of ways 
and may make phosphorus precipitation and low-grade struvite 
even more comparable, or at the very best, with NPVs within 
10% of each other. If phosphorus precipitation can use an 
existing clarifier and belt press for dewatering, the CAPEX value 
can drop to R0.78 million and consequently the NPC to R50.7 
million. At best alum sells for R1.08/kg; this results in a drop 
in the NPC to R38.6 million, which is now 1.5 times that of 
low-grade struvite. If possible, the excess sludge may be treated 
in the thermal drying plant, hence eliminating sludge disposal 
costs and reducing the NPC to R34.6 million. But even then, the 
base case design (no parameter changes) of low-grade struvite 
production is cheaper than phosphorus chemical precipitation 
over a 20-year period. In addition, as illustrated by Table 7, 
with these parameter changes, phosphorus precipitation comes 
within 10% of the high-grade struvite’s best-case scenario. In 
this case high-grade struvite could be cheaper than phosphorus 
precipitation, but low-grade struvite prodcution would still be 
the most economical option.

Discount rate for all three options
When calculating the NPV over a given period, discount 
rates apply to and may differ for public, private and public-
private partnership (PPP) investments. Typically, public sector 
discount rates are lower, and range between 3% and 10% and 
represent long-term project investments. Private investment 
or PPP schemes discount rates have been quoted to be as high 
as 15%, which usually accounts for capital financing (Burger 
and Hawkesworth, 2011). Figure 5 shows how the NPCs of all 
three options vary with a change in discount rate from 3–20%. 
High-grade struvite production experiences the greatest drop in 
NPC from R100 million to under R63 million at 20%. At higher 
discount rates, low-grade struvite and phosphorus precipitation 
become more comparable, a R15 million difference in NPV 
between 15 and 20%. At 5%, rates more representative of public 
sector investment, high-grade struvite, low-grade struvite and 
phosphorus precipitation increase to R90.5, R30.5 and R73.4 
million, respectively.
DISCUSSION
This paper set out to determine whether phosphate recovery 
technologies are likely to produce a socially acceptable product 
and what determines their affordability. 
In terms of affordability, if a WWTW is to reduce 
effluent phosphate loading to within legislative standards for 
environmental discharge, low-grade struvite production using 
a Multiform Harvest based set-up, has been shown to be the 
most ecologically and economically sustainable option from a 
lifecycle-costs perspective. It was found that CAPEX has the 
highest effect on NPV for both the high-grade and low-grade 
struvite options, whereas chemical dosing cost significantly 
affects chemical precipitation. Low-grade struvite is the 
most affordable and can be profitable within 19 years if the 
hypothetical selling price of struvite is increased to about R14/kg 
struvite. Despite optimistic changes in key design parameters for 
both high-grade (Ostara process) and phosphorus precipitation, 
a low-grade struvite (Multiform Harvest) process installed at the 
CFWWTW will always work out cheaper.

From a social standpoint, the experts interviewed believe 
that the South African food market could resist fertilizers 
derived from human waste, hence potentially ruling in favour 
of low-grade struvite for use in secondary non-food markets. 
Although the production of low-grade struvite is a simple 
process, it is not cheap; the capital investment is 10 times that of 
South Africa’s more familiar chemical precipitation route. Hence, 
a WWTW will have to consider the environmental benefits over 
the capital costs, if they are to consider phosphorus recovery 
instead of the more familiar chemical precipitation option. 
Recommendations
The following theoretical and policy implications should be 
considered: 
1. A shift is required to more sustainable wastewater 
treatment techniques: Although common and affordable, 
chemical precipitation incurs significant costs and diverting 
the phosphate from wastewater to solid waste merely shifts 
the environmental burden. Policy that bars sewage sludge 
disposal to agriculture as of 2015 (CDM Executive Board, 
n.d.), seen against increasingly limited landfill space, already 
has decision-makers exploring new options for sludge 
treatment and disposal.
2. Implementing low-grade struvite treatment is a beneficial 
alternative to current methods, from an environmental 
point of view: Similar to findings by Bilyk et al. (2010), 
low-grade struvite production is the cheapest of the three 
options investigated. Despite having the most attractive 
economics, local municipalities may find it hard to justify the 
high capital investment and unprofitable operations. When 
compared to most struvite production case studies, which 
have shown profitable outcomes within the 20-year period, 
struvite production from the current CFWWTW will not be 
profitable. However, this option does fall within the global 
cost bracket for struvite production at R8.90/kg struvite and

may be justified from this angle. Municipalities will have to 
consider the environmental benefits over the costs.
3. Identify and quantify the implications of phosphate 
recovery on other plant activities at the CFWWTW: Side-
stream treatment does not only reduce nutrient discharge 
into surrounding water bodies, but affects overall plant 
performance – in this case, nutrient concentrations typically 
received by both the secondary treatment and thermal 
drying plant will be affected. It is therefore essential to obtain 
more detail on such plant effects from installations globally 
and integrate these findings into a model for local WWTWs.
4. Phosphate loading to flow rate ratio affects profitability: 
High CAPEX associated with high-grade struvite production 
makes this the most costly choice, especially as the South 
African market may be better suited to lower-grade struvite 
production. However, this process only marginally increases 
treatment costs to R1.42/kL, which is cheaper than both the 
wastewater recycling for reuse (R7.00/kL) and sewage costs 
(R2.90/kL).
5. Wastewater may not be the ‘right’ phosphate stream to 
concentrate on in South Africa: Other WWTWs with 
a higher phosphate loading to flow rate ratio may yield 
economics in favour of high-grade production. However, 
one may need to consider the substantial electrical/carbon 
footprint. Even then, relative to phosphate run-off on 
farms and other urban sinks, the small amount of nutrients 
extractable from the wastewater profile makes it technically 
and economically difficult to justify. Mapping of an 
economy-wide phosphate pathway may identify larger sinks 
– organic matter sent to landfills may have more potential, 
especially as organic waste processing is at its infancy in 
South Africa.
6. There is space for innovation: The CAPEX for struvite 
production is substantial. Locally constructed reactors, with 
improved kinetics, might be cheaper than both the Ostara 
and Multiform Harvest installations and may lead to both 
funding and research opportunities in South Africa. 
7. Change phosphate policy to address scarcity rather than 
just pollution: Although progressive, the recent South 
African legislation limiting effluent phosphate to 1 mg/L 
treats phosphate as a nuisance rather than an essential 
resource. Policy could be modified to promote the reduction, 
reuse and recycling of phosphate; this would inherently 
tackle the pollution issue. The Nutrient Credit Trading 
system described by Algeo and O’Callaghan (2013) is an 
example of such a policy.
8. There are other South African market considerations: 
Government does not regulate the fertilizer markets. Both 
struvite processes were shown to be unprofitable, partly due 
to the low struvite prices, which are subject to South African 
phosphate fertilizer prices on the local market. As such, 
fertilizer policy and price regulations would help to better 
understand the placement of struvite in the fertilizer market. 
In addition, this could increase fertilizer prices to values 
more comparable to the global market.
CONCLUSIONS
This paper set out to compare three options for meeting 
phosphate discharge limits at a large biological wastewater 
treatment works in Cape Town, South Africa. Two options for 
phosphate recovery (high-grade vs low-grade struvite) were 
compared to conventional phosphate removal by chemical 
precipitation using metal salts. The main findings are that:
• The net present costs for high-grade, low-grade and chemical 
precipitation installations at the Cape Flats Wastewater 
Treatment works (CFWWTW), discounted at 10% over 
a 20-year period, were R76.2, R25.4 and R51.2 million, 
respectively: low-grade production suited for secondary 
markets is cheapest, regardless of key parameter changes 
• Chemical precipitation CAPEX is the lowest and is within 
the allocated budget for the planned CFWWTW upgrade.
• WWTWs with a higher phosphate loading to flow rate ratio 
may yield better economics. 
• Struvite will have to establish its own niche market, because 
the current phosphate market price in South Africa is too 
low to offset the costs of phosphate recovery.
• New policies for phosphate recovery require a paradigm 
shift in viewing phosphate, from a nuisance in WWTW to a 
valuable resource.
Limitations
This research used standard engineering techno-economic 
methods to assess and contrast three conceptual retrofit 
designs for phosphate recovery/removal, using data collected 
from various literary sources. Although plant samples 
and experimental work would have been preferred, plant 
irregularities at the CFWWTW made it difficult to attain 
trustworthy data. As such, this work is limited by the availability 
and reliability of the CFWWTW’s reported data as well as the 
‘engineering’ assumptions made. However, the results were 
scrutinized under a large degree of uncertainty, presented in the 
sensitivity analysis; thus this method provides decision makers 
with reasonable cost estimates, for comparing potential WWTW 
nutrient recovery projects.
