The results showed that the total 7 normalized midpoint value of the dross process is 32.16% lower than that of the 8 bauxite process. The cost of producing 1 t alumina by dross process is 130.01 $, 9 accounting for only 49.54% of that of bauxite process. Ammonium sulfate as a 10 by-product also brought in a profit of 22.18 $. These findings could be attributed to 11 the decrease in energy and raw material consumption (i.e., steam, sodium hydroxide, 12 electricity) and the relatively low cost of secondary luminum dross. Adjusting raw 13 materials for steam production and optimizing electricity structure could reduce the 14 overall environmental impact of secondary aluminum dross recovery. Based on the 15 forecast of environmental impact and policy adjustment in the future, inter-provincial 16 dross transportation and southwest aluminum industry migration in China could be 17 feasible solutions. 18  19 Keywords Life cycle assessment; Secondary aluminum dross; Recovery; Bauxite; 20 3 1.Introduction 21 In recent years, China has become the world's largest aluminum producer. During 22 the process of producing 1 t aluminum, more than 40 kg of aluminum dross is 23 generated (Meshram and Singh, 2018). In 2017, China produced 32.3 million tons of 24 primary aluminum, which means that the output of aluminum dross exceeded 1.29 25 million tons (National Bureau of Statistics of China, 2018). The component of 26 aluminum dross is determined by its source, usually containing aluminum metal, 27 aluminum oxide, iron oxide, silicon dioxide, aluminum nitride, aluminum carbide and 28 other metal oxides, chlorides and fluorides (Mahinroosta and Allahverdi, 2018b). 29 According to the number of times of aluminum dross recovery and the metal 30 aluminum content in dross, aluminum dross is usually divided into two categories: 31 primary aluminum dross and secondary aluminum dross. Secondary aluminum dross 32 has a low metal aluminum content of about 5-10 wt%, high oxide and salt content, 33 whereas primary aluminum dross contains a high metal fraction of about 30 wt% and 34 small amounts of oxide and salt compounds (Mahinroosta and Allahverdi, 2018). 35 Secondary aluminum dross is regarded as a hazardous waste in many countries. 36 In humid environment, secondary aluminum dross easily reacts with water, forming 37 flammable or toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen, and ammonia. Direct landfill 38 may let heavy metals such as Cd, Cr and Pb in the dross penetrate through soil and 39 water, causing harm to animals and plants (Mahinroosta and Allahverdi, 2018b). 40 Besides, the aluminum metal and aluminum oxide in the secondary aluminum dross 41 are both components with recovery value. The alumina resources contained in 1 t 42 secondary aluminum dross are generally equivalent to hat from 1.8 t bauxite. 43 Therefore, the accumulation of aluminum dross not only causes environmental 44 pollution, but also causes loss of valuable materials. 45 At present, primary aluminum dross recovery technology is relatively mature in 46 various countries around the world. However, secondary aluminum dross recovery 47 technologies are still in the stage of laboratory exploration. Hiraki et al. (2005) used 48 aluminum dross to produce hydrogen but ignored its economic utility. Murayama et al. 49 used aluminum dross to make specific materials such as AlPO4-5 type zeolitic 50 materials (Murayama et al., 2006) and Zn–Al type layered double hydroxides 51 (Murayama et al., 2012). Nevertheless, these methods cannot solve the practical 52 problem of massive dross accumulation. Mahinroosta et al. (2018a) successfully 53 4 extracted alumina from secondary aluminum dross in a low-energy and safe process. 54 However, the purity of alumina is hard to reach thestandard. In a nutshell, these 55 existing secondary aluminum dross recovery processes have shortcomings such as 56 high cost, small scale, and low value. Fortunately, our research group successfully 57 recovered alumina from secondary aluminum dross by using sodium hydroxide, 58 which not only had good yield but also met the national quality standard (Li et al., 59 2019; Jin et al., 2019; Song Ming, 2018). 60 In order to evaluate the environmental and economic superiority of our process, 61 life cycle assessment (LCA) coupled with life cycle osting (LCC) method is used, 62 which is an effective method to quantify the energy and materials invested in a 63 process and analyze the economic and environmental burdens caused by the process 64 (Hong et al., 2018). Unfortunately, there are very f w LCA studies on aluminum dross. 65 Nakajima et al. (2007) conducted LCA of hydrogen production from aluminum dross. 66 However, the output only included waste and carbon di xide emissions. Hong et al. 67 (2010) compared the resource consumption and waste discharge of aluminum-silicon 68 alloys production and alumina production from aluminum dross. Nevertheless, no 69 common LCA model was used to characterize the inventory, making their LCA results 70 lack systematicity and comparability. In conclusion, current LCA studies on 71 aluminum dross have serious limitations. 72 Since the process for recovering alumina from secondary aluminum dross is 73 promising and its environmental impact remains unknow , this study aims to use the 74 LCA coupled with LCC method evaluating the environmental impact and economic 75 cost of this innovative process. For comparison, the currently widely used process for 76 extracting alumina from bauxite through Bayer method was chosen as a baseline 77 scenario. The results are expected to provide data support for the industrialization of 78 secondary aluminum dross recovery. Based on the prediction of industrial adjustment 79 for China's aluminum industry, suggestions for process optimization and site selection 80 of dross recovery industry in China were proposed. 81 2. Methodology 82 2.1 Goal and scope 83 This study chose Bayer process as a baseline scenario to compare the 84 environmental impact and economic cost of recovering alumina from secondary 85 aluminum dross. The production of 1 t alumina was selected as the functional unit, 86 which was the base for life cycle inventory comparison. All materials, energy 87 5 consumption, emissions, waste disposal and economic costs were based on this 88 functional unit (International Organization for Standardization, 2006).  89 System boundaries were set by applying a cradle-to-ga e approach, which only 90 focused on industrial production in the entire life cycle of alumina. Since the 91 composition of aluminum dross is close to bauxite from the perspective of resource 92 attribute, dross and bauxite were set as the start of the system boundary in two 93 scenarios. Figure 1 shows the system boundary for two processes. Since the 94 transportation of the two processes is similar and its impacts in alumina production 95 accounts for less than 1%, transportation was not included in this study. 96 For baseline scenario, bauxite is the raw material for producing alumina with 97 Bayer method. Under high temperature and high pressu , bauxite can be dissolved in 98 a solution of high concentration sodium hydroxide. After precipitation and filtration, 99 sodium aluminate solution and red mud are obtained respectively. Due to the chemical 100 nature, sodium aluminate will gradually transform into aluminum hydroxide crystals 101 through dilution and stirring. The remaining alkaline solution can be recycled after 102 evaporation and concentration. Aluminum hydroxide will be converted into alumina 103 after calcination. 104 For dross scenario, secondary aluminum dross is the raw material. The additional 105 process is ‘gas production’, in which metal aluminum, aluminum carbide and 106 aluminum nitride react with sodium hydroxide at 90 , producing hydrogen, methane 107 and ammonia. Ammonia is absorbed by sulfuric acid to obtain ammonium sulfate in 108 another unique ‘acid absorption’ unit. Hydrogen and methane are used as fuel for 109 ‘calcination’ unit, achieving energy recovery. Other processes in these two scenarios 110 were similar, in which dosage or condition may be slightly different. The alumina 111 from dross is dissolved by sodium hydroxide at 250 . After filtration and dilution, 112 clear sodium aluminate solution would be obtained. After being diluted 2.5 times and 113 stirred at room temperature for 72 hours, sodium aluminate solution will precipitate 114 out aluminum hydroxide. The remaining alkaline soluti n can also be recycled after 115 evaporation and concentration. After calcination, aluminum hydroxide will be 116 converted to alumina. Under the above conditions, the recovery rate of alumina in 117 secondary aluminum dross can reach 88.20% (Li et al., 2019). The entire process will 118 produce dust, wastewater, and filter residue.  119 6  120  121 Fig. 1. System boundary of two processes: a) bauxite scenario, b) dross scenario. 122 2.2 Life cycle inventory 123 Life cycle inventory data for the bauxite process was from the average data of 124 relative industries in China. Data for the secondary luminum dross process was 125 mainly from the average data of our experimental results (Li et al., 2019; Jin et al., 126 7 2019; Song Ming, 2018). Since some processes of two scenarios were identical, some 127 data for energy consumption and emissions also referred to bauxite scenario. The 128 electricity type in this study was a hybrid electrici y based on China's national 129 conditions (70.99% thermal power, 18.59% hydropower, and 10.42% other forms of 130 power) (Yu Chongde, 2018). The steam used in this study was co l based. In addition, 131 the environmental impact data was from the latest vrsion 3.6 Ecoinvent database 132 integrated in GaBi 6.0 software. The cost of raw materi ls referred to market prices. 133 According to EN ISO 14040 standard, the life cycle inventory is an inventory of 134 the input/output data of the processes (Internationl Organization for Standardization, 135 2006). Table 1 displays the inventory of two scenarios. 136 Table 1  137 Life cycle inventory 138  Materials Bauxite scenario Dross scenario Units Resources (Input) Bauxite 2.48×103 0 kg Secondary aluminum dross 0 1.42×103 kg Lime 3.20×101 0 kg Sodium hydroxide 6.15×101 5.70×101 kg Steam 2.43×103 2.21×103 kg Water 2.00×100 1.24×100 t Electricity 1.69×102 2.14×102 kwh Natural gas 7.25×101 2.34×101 m³ Sulfuric acid 0 3.01×102 kg Emissions (Output) Waste water 7.91×102 3.13×102 kg Filter residue 7.58×102 2.89×102 kg Dust 2.90×10-1 1.58×10-2 kg Ammonia 1.25×10-2 8.93×10-2 kg Chromium 1.32×10-3 1.32×10-3 kg Bromine 1.15×10-3 1.14×10-3 kg Carbon monoxide 1.16×100 8.60×10-1 kg Hydrogen fluoride 1.57×10-3 1.47×10-3 kg Hydrogen sulfide 6.44×10-3 3.57×10-3 kg Sulfur dioxide 3.41×100 2.77×100 kg Propane 2.52×10-2 1.99×10-3 kg Xylene 9.17×10-2 9.16×10-2 kg 8 Particulate matters 10 1.61×10-1 3.74×10-6 kg Particulate matters 2.5 1.03×100 9.90×10-1 kg Biochemical oxygen demand 9.52×10-3 1.39×10-3 kg Chemical oxygen demand 2.60×10-1 2.60×10-1 kg 2.3 Impact assessment 139 On the one hand, since secondary aluminum dross is an emerging issue in recent 140 years, there is no industrialized treatment process urrently. The process of recovering 141 alumina from secondary aluminum dross is promising, but it is still in the early stage. 142 Therefore, the LCA of dross process in this study is an ex-ante type. On the other 143 hand, the bauxite process is very mature and most units and materials of both 144 processes are the same, which helps to estimate the da a of dross process based on 145 industrial scale. Overall, in order to evaluate the en rgy consumption and emissions of 146 the two processes, the comparative LCA study of the two processes is an attributional 147 type. 148 The LCA results were calculated at midpoint level using the version 1.08 of 149 ReCiPe 2008 model, which is one of the most authoritative approaches in LCA 150 analysis, including eighteen representative environmental impact categories. The 151 characterization factors were based Ecoinvent database 3.6 integrated in GaBi 6.0 152 software. The reference values for normalization were the global midpoint values for 153 ReCiPe 2008 model, in which the normalization factors were updated in December 154 2014 (Goedkoop et al., 2014; Sleeswijk et al., 2008). The costs of two processes were 155 assessed through LCC method. The LCC method is similar to LCA, wherein the 156 evaluation considers the cost of energy and raw materials listed in the inventory 157 instead of the environmental impacts. Since the gap of costs of labor in the raw 158 material, energy production and manufacture stages between two processes is small, 159 those costs were not included in this paper. The LCC results were calculated based on 160 the price and amount of materials. 161 2.4 Interpretation 162 Main contributing processes and key substances were id ntified through life 163 cycle interpretation. In dross scenario, since the environmental impact and economic 164 cost caused by alumina production accounted for more than 95% of the entire process, 165 the allocation of environmental and economic burden from ammonium sulfate 166 production was not considered for the convenience of this work. In section 4.3.1, the 167 9 benefit of using natural gas based steam was discussed. Two new scenarios were 168 assumed: (1) Using natural gas as raw material to produce steam at 85% efficiency; (2) 169 Using natural gas as raw material to produce steam at 95% efficiency. In section 4.3.2, 170 the adjustment of electricity structure was proposed. Since Henan and Shandong, the 171 two largest alumina production provinces in China, strongly depend on thermal power, 172 the power structure of Qinghai Province (24.8% thermal power, 53.9% hydro power, 173 18.3% solar power, 2.9% of wind power) was taken as an example to analyze the 174 reduction of environmental impacts. In section 4.4.1, inter-provincial dross 175 transportation was proposed and its benefits and impacts were discussed. In section 176 4.4.2, suggestion for the south and southwest migration of the aluminum industry in 177 China was discussed. 178 3. Results 179 3.1 LCA midpoint results 180 Table 2 shows the midpoint results of life cycle impact assessment pointing out 181 the contribution of most significant processes. For b th scenarios, steam consumption 182 represented dominant contribution in most categories (usually over 50%), indicating 183 that alumina production is an energy-intensive industry. Furthermore, the dross 184 scenario had less potential impact in all categories and the improvements in most 185 categories was over 30%, which was mainly due to different alumina content in 186 bauxites and dross. Concretely speaking, the alumin in bauxite is relatively less 187 than secondary aluminum dross, resulting in higher material input and energy 188 consumption during the extraction. In addition, the characteristic value of metal 189 depletion category in secondary aluminum dross process was -0.257. That’s because 190 the dross process uses industrial residual as a raw material, avoiding the consumption 191 of bauxite. Another interesting point was that electricity was not found to dominate 192 the environmental impact, for example, its contribution to climate change was only 193 17.52%. That was because the amount of electricity used in both processes was much 194 lower than the amount of steam. Thus, steam replaced el ctricity as the main 195 contributor to the climate change category. 196 10 Table 2 ReCiPe midpoint results for two processes 197 Categories Units Bauxite scenario Dross scenario Improvement % Results Main contributing process Results Main contribu ing process Climate change kg CO2 eq 1.09×103 Steam (55.5%) + NaOH (23.1%) 7.36×102 Steam (68.1%) 32.48  Terrestrial acidification kg SO2 eq 2.16×100 Steam (47.8%) + NaOH (21.2%) 1.52×100 Steam (52.4%) + H2SO4 (31.2%) 29.63  Freshwater eutrophication kg P eq 1.60×10-3 NaOH (88.1%) 2.86×10-4 NaOH (46.9%) + H2SO4 (29.7%) 82.13  Ozone depletion kg CFC-11 eq 3.13×10-10 NaOH (87.5%) 3.09×10-10 NaOH (39.6%) + H2SO4 (37.9%) 1.28  Fossil depletion kg oil eq 4.26×102 Steam (55.0%) 3.21×102 Steam (52.5%) 24.65  Freshwater ecotoxicity kg 1,4-DB eq 1.55×10-1 NaOH (71.0%) 4.87×10-2 Steam (34.2%) + NaOH (24.4%) 68.58  Human toxicity kg 1,4-DB eq 7.86×101 Steam (48.1%) 6.29×101 Steam (77.8%) 19.97  Ionizing radiation U235 eq 2.62×101 NaOH (92.0%) 1.92×101 H2SO4 (47.9%) + NaOH (40.3%) 26.72  Marine ecotoxicity kg 1,4-DB eq 6.74×10-2 Steam (34.6%) + NaOH (35.9%) 4.23×10-2 Steam (55.0%) 37.24  Marine eutrophication kg N eq 7.40×10-1 Steam (50.3%) + NaOH (27.1%) 5.10×10-1 Steam (68.4%) 31.08  Metal depletion kg Fe eq 6.46×101 Bauxite (91.3%) -2.57×10-1 Dross (100.0%) 100.40  Particulate matter formation kg PM10 eq 1.53×100 Steam (36.6%) + Bauxite (28.2%) + Electricity (22.8%) 5.90×10-1 Steam (61.9%) 61.44 Photochemical oxidant formation kg NMVOC eq 2.11×101 Steam (52.2%) + NaOH (23.8%) 1.43×101 Steam (65.1%) 32.23  Terrestrial ecotoxicity kg 1,4-DB eq 4.03×10-2 Steam (54.7%)  3.39×10-2 Steam (79.7%) 15.88  Water depletion m3 6.11×102 NaOH (78.6%) 5.24×102 NaOH (35.7%) + Electricity (36.5%) 14.24  11 3.2 Normalized LCA midpoint results 198 In order to compare the differences between various categories, characteristic 199 values need to be normalized. As shown in Figure 2, human toxicity accounted for the 200 largest proportion in the normalized value of both processes, which was caused by a 201 variety of reasons: (1) Both processes produced particulate matters and harmful gases 202 such as hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, etc. (2) Harmful components such as 203 chromium and xylene were present in the waste water. (3) The amount of solid waste 204 was considerable, especially the red mud from bauxite process. (4) Alumina extraction 205 required high consumption of electricity, steam, and atural gas. During the 206 production of these energy, various toxic and hazardous substances were produced, 207 which was the hidden and main cause of high human toxici y value. Compared with 208 the proportion of 47.6% in bauxite scenario, the normalized human toxicity value of 209 dross process accounted for 63.0% of the total value. However, the actual human 210 toxicity normalization value was lower than that of the bauxite process, indicating that 211 the total values of all categories in dross scenario was significantly lower.  212 In addition, the normalized values of the two processes in the fossil depletion 213 category were apparently different. Fossil depletion was mainly caused by electricity 214 and steam consumption. Since the alumina that can be recovered from per unit mass 215 of dross was higher than that from per unit mass of bauxite, the energy requirement of 216 dross scenario was relatively low under the same output. Furthermore, according to 217 the dross process proposed by our group, hydrogen and methane generated by 218 aluminum and aluminum carbide was used as fuels in the calcination unit, which 219 made up part of the energy demand. 220 Overall, the total normalized values of bauxite process and dross process were 221 1.99 and 1.35 respectively, indicating that producing alumina by dross process had 222 better environmental benefits. 223 12  224 Fig. 2. Normalized midpoint results 225 3.3. Sensitivity analysis 226 Figure 3 presented the sensitivity analysis results of main contributors (steam, 227 sodium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid) for both process s. The amounts of these main 228 contributors were reduced by 5%. 229 For bauxite scenario, despite the high sensitivity of sodium hydroxide in 230 freshwater eutrophication, ozone depletion, ionizing radiation, and water depletion, 231 steam showed the highest sensitivity in other categori s. For dross scenario, due to the 232 reduced use of sodium hydroxide and the introduction of sulfuric acid, the sensitivity 233 of sodium hydroxide to the above categories was reduc  absolutely by 1% to 3%, 234 partly replaced by sulfuric acid. Steam showed the highest sensitivity in 12 categories. 235 However, this highlight was not due to the amount of steam but the decrease in the 236 sensitivity of other materials. While the consumption of other resources reduced, 237 steam consumption still accounted for 90.9% of the consumption in bauxite process, 238 making its sensitivity more pronounced. As for electricity and water, neither of the 239 two scenarios showed high sensitivity. Therefore, reducing steam demand or using 240 renewable energy is the key to reducing the overall nvironmental impact of dross 241 process. 242 13  243 Fig. 3. Sensitivity analysis: a) bauxite scenario, b) dross scenario. 244 3.4 LCC results 245 The LCA results proved that the environmental impact of dross process is less 246 than that of bauxite process. In order to find out whether dross process is also superior 247 in economic term, the raw material cost and energy cost of two processes were 248 compared in Table 3. In the calculation, the exchange rate of USD to RMB is set to 1 249 $ equal to 7.136 ￥. 250 The total cost of producing 1 t alumina from bauxite was 262.46 $, while the cost 251 of dross process was 130.01 $, accounting for only 49.5% of the bauxite scenario. 252 This gap was mainly caused by the difference in raw material prices. Since secondary 253 aluminum dross was regarded as an industrial solid waste and the dross used in the 254 14 experiment was freely donated by the enterprise, the price of the secondary aluminum 255 dross was set as 0 $. In fact, due to the dangerous properties of secondary aluminum 256 dross, ordinary companies do not have the processing qualifications (Meshram and 257 Singh, 2018), and even need to spend money to ask other qualified organizations to 258 properly handle the dross. In addition, when producing 1 t alumina, dross process 259 obtained 406 kg ammonium sulfate as a by-product, with a profit of 22.18 $, which 260 was higher than the cost of sulfuric acid, water, and electricity. The absorption of 261 ammonia by sulfuric acid not only reduced its pollution to the atmosphere, but also 262 achieved economic benefits. 263 Table 3 264 LCC results of two processes 265 Materials Price Units Cost [$] Bauxite scenario Dross scenario Bauxite 52.971 $/t 131.37 0 Secondary aluminum dross 0 $/t 0 0 Lime 11.911 $/t 0.38 0 Sodium hydroxide 197.590 $/t 12.15 11.26 Steam 28.728 $/t 69.81 63.49 Water 0.392 $/t 0.78 0.49 Electricity 0.149 $/kWh 25.10 31.79 Natural gas 0.315 $/m3 22.86 7.38 Sulfuric acid 51.850 $/t 131.37 15.61 Total   262.46 130.01 Figure 4 shows the environmental impact coupled with economic costs of the 266 key material used in dross process. The Y axis show the economic cost of water, 267 sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, electricity, and steam. The X axis represents the sum 268 of normalized values of all environmental impact categories for each material. As can 269 be seen, the polyline continues to extend to the upper right, meaning that for dross 270 scenario, the environmental loads of materials are proportional with the economic 271 costs. The use of steam brought the largest environmental impact and consumed 272 highest economic costs. Environmental pollution and economic costs caused by 273 electricity cannot be ignored neither. Therefore, reducing the use of steam and 274 15 electricity or using clean energy could be the key to reducing the environmental 275 impacts as well as economic costs of secondary aluminum process. 276  277 Fig. 4. Environmental impact coupled with economic costs analysis for dross process 278 4.Discussion 279 4.1 Unit analysis 280 Due to the differences in the partial process of two scenarios, the gas production 281 unit and the gas absorption unit are unique in dross process. To further optimize the 282 environmental benefits of the dross process, it is necessary to identify the 283 environmental impact of these two units. Figure 5 shows the ratio of the LCA 284 midpoint values of these two units to the total values of the entire process. 285  286 16 Fig. 5. Proportion of the characteristic values of two uniq e units 287 In the gas absorption unit, the proportion was relatively small because of the low 288 material and energy input in this unit. Fossil depletion had the highest proportion of 289 16%. As the main input of this unit, sulfuric acid used in the process was produced 290 from pyrites. During the production of pyrites, hig-temperature processing and 291 catalytic heating reaction were required, leading to high energy consumption (Yuan 292 and Wang, 2012). Together with the input of electricity and water, fossil depletion 293 accounted for the largest proportion. 294 In the gas production unit, freshwater eutrophication, freshwater ecotoxicity, 295 ionizing radiation, water depletion and fossil depletion accounted for a large 296 proportion of the total characteristic values. The characteristic value of ionizing 297 radiation in gas production unit accounted for 98.0% of that value of the whole 298 process, which was mainly caused by the consumption of sodium hydroxide for 299 dissolving secondary aluminum dross. In addition, sdium hydroxide also exacerbated 300 freshwater eutrophication and ecotoxicity to some extent. Furthermore, in order to 301 prepare the sodium hydroxide solution and reach the reaction temperature, this unit 302 also consumed a large amount of water as well as electricity, resulting in large 303 proportion of water and fossil depletion. However, despite of the environmental 304 hazards caused by sodium hydroxide in dross process, the bauxite process also 305 required large amounts of sodium hydroxide, which was even 8% higher (Zhang et al., 306 2016). 307 4.2 Key substances identification 308 Identifying key substances emitted by the two processes is beneficial to better 309 analysis of their environmental impact. Figure 6 shows the key substances produced 310 by two processes that mostly affecting the climate change and fossil depletion. Since 311 carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming, the key substances of climate 312 change for both processes were identified as carbon dioxide, with a proportion over 313 92%. Methane and Nitrous oxide accounted for about 2% of the contribution. 314 Although the distributions of key substances in two scenarios were similar, the 315 characteristic value of dross process was lower, threfore resulting less greenhouse 316 gas emissions. Additionally. the key substances of fossil depletion in two scenarios 317 were quite different. On the one hand, high energy consumption of bauxite process led 318 to the high proportion of natural gas. On the other and, secondary aluminum dross 319 process consumed 44.86 kWh more electricity than the bauxite process when 320 17 producing 1 t alumina, leading to higher contribution of coal based on China's current 321 power generation mode. As the backward small power plants gradually shutting down, 322 the energy source of electricity will be much cleanr (Cui et al., 2012; Wang et al., 323 2019). Furthermore, it can be reasonably inferred that if dross process can be 324 industrialized after years, electricity consumption and overall energy demand will be 325 significantly reduced (Zhang et al., 2015). Technology development will bring 50% 326 reduction in greenhouse gas emission factors after 10 years (Liu et al., 2016). 327   328    329 Fig. 6. Contribution of significant substances to the midpoint score: a) Climate change 330 from dross scenario, b) Climate change from bauxite scenario, c) Fossil depletion 331 from dross scenario, d) Fossil depletion from bauxite scenario. 332 4.3 Scenario analysis 333 Compared with the bauxite scenario, dross scenario represents lower economic 334 costs and higher environmental benefit in all categori s. According to the coupled 335 LCC and LCA in Figure 4, the environmental and economic burden of dross scenario 336 was mainly due to the strong dependence on steam and electricity. In order to further 337 reduce the environmental impact caused by dross process, adjusting its energy 338 18 structure was proposed. 339 4.3.1 Steam material replacement 340 Table 2 identified the key processes in most categori s as steam, which was 341 produced from coal at 95% efficiency in the original c lculation. As mentioned in 342 section 2.4, two new scenarios using natural gas based steam were proposed. Table 4 343 shows the changes of characteristic values of 10 categories that are most affected by 344 steam. 345 When using natural gas as raw material to produce steam at 85% efficiency, the 346 characteristic values of all environmental categories except fossil depletion 347 significantly decreased. When utilization rate increased from 85% to 95%, the 348 characteristic values were further decreased. Human toxicity, particulate matter 349 formation and terrestrial ecotoxicity showed the largest decline, all of which exceeded 350 50%. Since the characterization factor of natural gas in the fossil depletion category is 351 slightly higher than that of coal (Steubing et al., 2016), fossil depletion showed a 352 small increase of 9.91%. However, denying the use of natural gas based on only one 353 indicator is unreasonable. From other evaluation indicators of the ReCiPe model 354 (Goedkoop et al., 2014; Sleeswijk et al., 2008), the small increase in fossil depletion 355 was followed by a tremendous improvement in the enviro ment and human health. 356 Obviously, the advantages of using natural gas as the steam material outweighed the 357 disadvantages. Besides, if the utilization efficieny of steam is improved, the 358 characteristic value of fossil depletion may also decrease. Furthermore, changes in 359 steam production materials will also lead to changes in economic costs. Producing 1 t 360 steam at 95% efficiency consumes about 75.82 m3 natural gas, 21.62 kWh electricity, 361 and 0.17t water (Althaus et al., 2007). Based on the production of 1 t alumina, 362 compared with the original steam cost of 63.49 $, the cost of producing steam with 363 natural gas would be 60.05 $. Therefore, while the environmental impact was greatly 364 reduced, the economic cost also reduced by 2.65%. 365 Table 4 366 Changes of characteristic values in new scenarios 367 Categories Changes of Characteristic Values/% 85% Natural Gas 95% Natural Gas Climate change -14.65  -20.20  Terrestrial acidification -42.00  -43.00  19 Fossil depletion 19.44  9.91  Freshwater ecotoxicity -27.20  -27.92  Human toxicity -76.70  -76.80  Marine ecotoxicity -49.08  -49.69  Marine eutrophication -31.34  -35.20  Particulate matter formation -53.85  -54.95  Photochemical oxidant formation -30.98  -34.51  Terrestrial ecotoxicity -76.85  -76.95  4.3.2 Electricity structure adjustment 368 In dross scenario, the environmental impact of electricity ranked second only to 369 steam. Henan, Shandong and Qinghai are the three provinces with the highest primary 370 aluminum production in China (Hao et al., 2016). Asmentioned in section 2.4, 371 assuming the electricity composition of dross recovry follows the example of 372 Qinghai, the reduction in environmental impacts is hown in Table 5. 373 Table 5 374 Improvement of characteristic values under electricity structure adjustment 375 Categories Reduction /% Climate change 12.58% Terrestrial acidification 9.94% Freshwater eutrophication 4.34% Ozone depletion 14.34% Fossil depletion 10.07% Freshwater ecotoxicity 7.70% Human toxicity 14.30% Ionizing radiation 5.75% Marine ecotoxicity 10.76% Marine eutrophication 13.60% Metal depletion 0.19% Particulate matter formation 11.42% Photochemical oxidant formation 12.83% Terrestrial ecotoxicity 14.36% Water depletion 10.60% After adjusting the electricity structure, all environmental categories showed a 376 20 certain degree of improvement, mostly over 10%. Thereason why the improvement 377 of metal depletion is extremely slight was because the main process in this category is 378 aluminum dross. Since the recovery of second alumin dross has already achieved 379 environmental benefits in metal depletion, the current result is acceptable. Therefore, 380 if these high aluminum production provinces want to recover alumina from secondary 381 aluminum dross, increasing the proportion of hydro power could be an effective way 382 to solve environmental problems. However, since the aluminum industry is already 383 mature, it is not easy to change the local electricity structure. In this case, dross 384 transportation could be a feasible solution. 385 4.4 Industrial recommendations 386 4.4.1 Dross transportation 387 Transporting secondary aluminum dross from nearby povinces that heavily rely 388 on thermal power to hydropower-type provinces for further recovery could also be a 389 beneficial suggestion. Figure 7 shows the power structu e of each province in China. 390 As can be seen, Qinghai could be theransport destination for aluminum dross in 391 Xinjiang and Ningxia, which are also two provinces with high aluminum production. 392 Hubei could be the transport destination for aluminum dross in Henan and Shandong. 393  394 Fig. 7. The power structure of each province in China 395 Long-distance transportation may cause additional environmental problems, 396 especially climate change and particulate matter formation (Zhang et al., 2016). 397 Transportation distance is the most important factor (Fan et al., 2018). For the case of 398 21 dross transportation, as the distance increases, th greenhouse gas emissions will 399 gradually increase, eventually exceeding the enviromental benefits brought by 400 hydropower. According to the power structure of Qinghai and Ningxia (Yu Chongde, 401 2018), hydropower replacement can reduce the characteristic value of climate change 402 by 107.7 kg CO2 eq when producing 1 t alumina. As shown in Figure 8, when dross is 403 transported over 664 kilometers, electricity structure adjustment will no longer be a 404 wise choice. Similarly, when the distance exceeds 945 kilometers, the particulate 405 matter discharged from transportation exceeds the improvement from electricity 406 structure adjustment (0.2646 kg PM10 eq).  407 Furthermore, Qinghai Province has the lowest industrial electricity price in China 408 at 0.053 $/kWh. The industrial electricity price in Hubei is similar to that in Shandong 409 and Henan (Yu Chongde, 2018). If using the average hydropower price in Hubei and 410 Qinghai as the standard, the electricity cost can be reduced by 5.64 $ when producing 411 1 t alumina. According to trucks’ general energy consumption and diesel prices in 412 China (Ministry of Transport of the People’s Republic of China, 2018), the cost of 100 413 km transportation is about 0.717 $/t. When the transportation distance exceeds 554 414 kilometers, the economic cost of dross transportatin will exceed the original plan. 415 Therefore, from the perspective of economic cost, transporting the dross to Qinghai 416 and Hubei has limited benefits but acceptable. 417  418 Fig. 8. Relationship between environmental impact and transportation distance 419 4.4.2 Industry migration 420 According to bauxite and alumina statistics information from United States 421 22 Geological Survey (United States Geological Survey, 2019), compared with other 422 countries, China is facing a dilemma of low reserves and high demand for bauxite. 423 Such situation requires China to increase the utiliza on of bauxite, which means that 424 the aluminum industry must pay attention to the recov ry of million tons of tailings 425 such as secondary aluminum dross. Since dross recovery is the end industry of 426 aluminum production and it has not been industrialized, the site selection should 427 particularly focus on the future trends of aluminum industry. 428 Previous analysis showed that hydropower could bring s gnificant environmental 429 benefits for dross recovery. Therefore, hydropower-type provinces will be suitable 430 construction sites. Similar perspectives were obtained according to the LCA of 431 China’s aluminum industry (Guo et al., 2019; Hao et al., 2016). At the provincial level, 432 industry migration to south and southwest areas (hydropower-type provinces) was 433 reasonable from the perspective of environmental polluti n. 434 According to the mineral resources report from Ministry of Natural Resources of 435 China (Ministry of Natural Resources of the People’s Republic of China, 2019), as the 436 demand for bauxite increases year by year, Henan and Shanxi, which provides bauxite 437 for Shandong, is facing shortage of resources and decline in the bauxite quality. 438 Evaluation of China's bauxite potential indicated that more than 100 million tons high 439 quality laterite type bauxite was discovered in Guangxi Province in recent years. 440 Other southern provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangdong were believed 441 having huge exploration potential. The distribution of bauxite shows that aluminum 442 industry will likely migrate from traditional industrial provinces such as Henan and 443 Shandong to southern provinces in the future. 444 Both policy and environmental factors suggest the south and southwest migration 445 of the aluminum industry. Based on a comprehensive for cast of environmental 446 impact and policy adjustment, Yunnan and Guangxi are the most suitable destinations 447 for the aluminum industry migration and secondary aluminum dross recovery. 448 5.Conclusion 449 In this paper, LCA method is used to compare the enviro mental impacts and 450 economic costs of two processes for producing alumina from secondary aluminum 451 dross as well as bauxite. Both characteristic values and normalized values of all 452 environmental impact categories of the secondary aluminum dross process are lower 453 than the bauxite process. LCC results showed that dross process could reduce the cost 454 of 132.45 $ by producing 1 t alumina compared to bauxite process. The characteristic 455 23 value caused by sodium hydroxide accounts for the largest proportion of the unique 456 gas production unit in dross scenario, while it’s sill 8% lower than bauxite scenario. 457 The LCA coupled with LCC results showed that the usof steam and electricity 458 were the keys to reducing the environmental impacts s well as economic costs of 459 dross process. Using natural gas as raw material to produce steam instead of coal can 460 significantly reduce the environmental impact of the whole dross process. Increasing 461 the use of hydropower in China’s high aluminum production provinces can generally 462 bring 10% environmental benefits for dross process. Dross transportation within 591 463 km or south and southwest migration of aluminum industry could be feasible 464 solutions in China. 465 This study provides data support for the industrialization of secondary aluminum 466 dross recovery. However, the current study has several limitations. Some data of the 467 dross process were based on experiments, which might be small changes in actual 468 industrial production. Some background data were sel cted from the European 469 database, which may have slight difference from the actual situation in China. Thus, 470 further research on secondary aluminum dross recovery is necessary.  471 24 Author Contributions 472 Jin.Q. and Zhu.X. performed the experiments and design d the life cycle assessment. 473 All authors collected and analyzed the data.
