Firms in most sectors often operate in turbulent environments, where the frequency of economic andstructural shocks is increasing dramatically: both sudden events and more gradual transformations can profoundlyreshape the surrounding competitive scenario, leading local actors to a continuous process of readaptation andtransformation. In this evolving context, the ability to redesign the organizational structure and develop newgrowth paths plays a crucial role in determining firms’ long‐term competitiveness.The recent literature on economic resilience has provided evidence of the existence of asymmetric territorialdynamics after economic crises or other unexpected changes (Diodato & Weterings, 2014; Fingleton, Garretsen, &Martin, 2012, 2015; Martin, 2012), highlighting how local factors are crucial to explain the heterogeneous behaviorof economic agents in such circumstances. Most of the empirical investigations on resilience focus on the macro‐behavior of regions, countries or cities, while micro‐level analyses on firms operating in the same industry are lessdiffused (Behrens, Boualam, & Martin, 2019; Duschl, 2016; Modica & Reggiani, 2015). This lack of contributions issurprising, given the essential role of firms in driving local development (Frenken & Boschma, 2007; Martin, 2012).More important, firm‐level behavior might change significantly between industries, especially when shocks aresector‐specific. In such cases, the adjustment process of the industry at the local level is inevitably overlooked whenthe analysis is implemented on the region as a whole (Urban, Pazitka, Ioannou, & Wojcik, 2019).Given the above considerations, firm‐level empirical contributions can represent an important stream for futureresearch on economic resilience: however, the development of new empirical work must be supported by reliablemethodological tools. Resilience scholars are still in the process of developing analytical methods specifically targeted atidentifying and capturing the existence of asymmetric responses across local actors. Despite the presence of valuableattempts to fill the existing gap, the need to develop more rigorous statistical analyses of the reaction and recoverydynamics of regions is still pressing (Martin, 2012; Martin & Sunley, 2015; van Bergeijk, Brakman, & van Marrewijk, 2017).The aim of this paper is to contribute to advance the current empirical literature on economic resilience byproposing a novel parametric model that allows to study local responses to disturbances and to detect the presenceof specific space‐time patterns of firms’ performance in the data. The proposed specification combines twoframeworks—the geographically weighted regression (GWR) and the endogenous panel stochastic frontier model inthe style of Karakaplan and Kutlu (2017b)—to locally estimate the temporal patterns of technical efficiency inspecific firm populations, overcoming the main limitations of the existing methodologies. The empirical approachpresented in this paper is particularly beneficial to evaluate the resilience dynamics of firm populations affected byrelevant shocks and disturbances: during these periods, when the local responses of firms are likely to be highlyasymmetric, assuming the presence of a single global trend of performances and ignoring spatial factors isparticularly unrealistic. The empirical investigation employs data from the Italian wine industry and is focused onthe 2009–2014 period: the setting appears particularly appropriate for our goals for several reasons. First, wineproduction represents a strategic sector in the Italian economy: Italy is the world’s leading producer of wine and isthe second‐largest wine exporter in the world (International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV), 2018). Second,Italy’s wine sector is one of the major beneficiaries of funding from the European Union (EU), ranking second duringthe 2009–2018 period. Last but not least, this sector has been affected by a major institutional change in 2008, thatis, the Common Market Organization (CMO) reform, and producers’ performances are heavily dependent oncontext‐specific and localized tangible and intangible assets (Morrison & Rabellotti, 2017).This study contributes to the existing literature in three main ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, this isthe first paper which develops a specific methodology to evaluate economic resilience using a firm‐levelperspective, identifying an applicable model for future contributions in this underdeveloped area of research. Thefocus of this analysis is on the resistance phase, as regional differences in terms of resilience mainly concern thisinitial phase (Fingleton et al., 2012). Second, the empirical approach provides an important advancement in the fieldof efficiency analysis, combining the GWR and endogenous stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) frameworks withfunctional mixture models in a two‐step procedure: following this method, it is possible to isolate homogeneousterritorial clusters of farm holdings, defined as spatial regimes.1 This approach allows to overcome a limitation ofmost macro‐level analyses, that is the use of territorial boundaries imposed a priori (e.g., administrative regions):given these boundaries do not necessarily mirror the territorial dynamics occurring in the locality, the use ofsmaller subregional scales tend to generate more robust empirical results (Di Caro & Fratesi, 2018). Third, theproposed approach is specifically designed to meet the needs of policy makers to develop place‐based strategies1It is worth noting that the term spatial regime should not be understood as a perfect synonym of “cluster”; more precisely, the term “regime” is linked tothe production function underlying the spatial process. The identification of different spatial regimes, in a sense, is equivalent to the identification ofsimilar growth paths after a shock.654 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIthat overcome the limitations of the traditional one‐size‐fits‐all development policies, exploiting the potential ofboth the territories and the individuals that live and interact in them (Barca, 2009; Barca, McCann, &Rodriguez‐Pose, 2012; OECD, 2009). According to Ali et al. (2007), taking into account spatial heterogeneity iscrucial to develop effective policies: this is especially true as far as periods of crisis are concerned, given theliterature has shown that the reaction of firms in different regional contexts is highly differentiated.The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 contains an overview of the literature on regionaland sectoral resilience, focusing on the recent theoretical and empirical contributions in these fields of researchand on the identification of the main gaps in the existing debate. Section 3 introduces the novel parametric frontierframework and discusses the distinctive features of the proposed estimation algorithm, explaining how the modelallows to account for heterogeneous space‐time patterns in the data. After having highlighted some relevantfeatures and the recent transformations in the Italian wine industry, Section 4 presents an application to a sampleof Italian wine producers. The empirical exercise shows the effectiveness of the model in capturing some importantfeatures of the data, highlighting the presence of some relevant firm‐level and environmental and institutionalfactors associated with higher levels of resilience. Section 5 summarizes the main findings and presents someconcluding remarks and possible directions for future research.2 | THE HETEROGENEOUS RESPONSE OF LOCAL ACTORS TO SHOCKSAND DISTURBANCES: AN OVERVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ONREGIONAL AND SECTORAL RESILIENCEEconomic actors face continuous transformations associated with a wide range of unexpected circumstances,including economic recessions, environmental disasters, regulatory changes, unexpected plant closures, and theintroduction of new technologies (Holm & Østergaard, 2015). In the recent past, the frequency and the impact ofthese events have increased dramatically, intensifying the instability of regions and cities in the global economy: therecent economic downturn that has affected most developed countries is probably the most widely used exampleof this changing dynamics. In such an evolving context, the increased popularity of the concept of resilience shouldbe interpreted as a rational response to the need of advancing our understanding of an increasingly uncertain andrisk‐prone world (Christopherson, Michie, & Tyler, 2010; Martin, 2018).Despite its widespread use in several academic disciplines, the notion of resilience has attracted particular attention inthe field of economic geography, given its effectiveness to describe the heterogeneous reactions and recovery mechanismsof regions, cities and local communities in face of major shocks, disturbances, and perturbations. The emergence oftheoretical and empirical studies on regional resilience is associated with the awareness that regional economicdevelopment is often characterized by continuous interruptions and disruptions, leading local actors to relentlessly adaptover time to various kinds of stress (Simmie & Martin, 2010). In this context, a regional economic system is defined asresilient if it is able to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from a disturbance (Foster, 2007).Among the main approaches identified by the literature, the evolutionary view is often identified as the moreeffective to capture the complex and multifaceted nature of these processes: indeed, evolutionary scholarspostulate the possibility for local economies to continuously move from one equilibrium to another as a result of ashock or a disturbance (Boschma, 2015; Diodato & Weterings, 2014). Such an approach assumes the existence ofmultiple equilibria, whereby if the previous growth path disappears after a shock, the region can still move to analternative growth path in the recovery stage (Christopherson et al., 2010). The empirical contributions developedin the recent past seem to confirm the appropriateness of this approach, showing that the effects and theconsequences of a shock or a disturbance typically vary substantially from one territory to another. Evidence ofheterogeneous responses of regions to disturbances and emergence of new growth paths has been reported forBritain (Fingleton et al., 2012; Martin, 2012), the Netherlands (Diodato & Weterings, 2014), Italy (Cellini & Torrisi,2014; Di Caro, 2017), Turkey (Eraydin, 2016), Greece (Giannakis & Bruggeman, 2017), Spain (Angulo, Mur, &CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 655Trívez, 2018), and Sweden (Nyström, 2018). The same patterns are identified in cross‐country analyses of EUregions, such as the one implemented by Brakman et al. (2015) and Fingleton et al. (2015).The core of the empirical research on regional resilience is centered around global shocks and focuses on the macro‐behavior of regions, countries, or cities. Conversely, micro‐level analyses on firms affected by industry‐specific shocks areless diffused (Modica & Reggiani, 2015): this lack of contributions is surprising, considering firms’ strategic decisions areessential to understand resilience patterns. According to Frenken and Boschma (2007), firms ultimately drive thedevelopment of regional and national economies and are the true agents of change. Given a region is typically composed ofa wide number of heterogeneous firms, a regional economy might be resilient in one sense but not in another (Gong &Hassink, 2016). More important, when the shock is sector‐specific, the dynamics of the region as a whole does not providerelevant indications to disentangle the adjustment process taking place at the industry level. In such cases, restrictingthe focus improves the consistency of the analysis, as the path to recovery of the regional industry might differ from therecovery of the regional economy (Holm & Østergaard, 2015).In light of this discussion, a number of recent contributions have introduced the concept of sectoral resilience(Behrens et al., 2019; Fromhold‐Eisebith, 2015; Urban et al., 2019), looking at industry‐specific patterns ofadjustment to sectoral shocks. The main claim of this emerging strand of the literature is that sectoral shocks areoften not region‐specific, and the adjustment process of firms may not necessarily prioritize the recovery of anyspecific region. On the contrary, firms generally allocate resources and respond to economic shocks by interactingwith the other actors of the global value chain, which generally operate across multiple regions (Treado &Giarratani, 2008). According to this view, sectors react through the implementation of supra‐regional, often globalstrategies, and the resilience capacity of a region is often limited (Urban et al., 2019).In this paper, we claim that a purely regional or purely sectoral approach toward resilience is not sufficient to interpretindustry‐specific shocks when the affected sector is characterized by strong territorial patterns. On the one hand, thefocus on the whole region tends to mask the true local dynamics in response to the disturbance, as it includes a number oflocal actors that are not affected by these transformations. On the other hand, a purely sectoral perspective only focuseson cross‐regional adjustments, whereas the majority of the interactions in these specific industries take place at the locallevel. In such circumstances, an hybrid approach is likely to be more robust, in that it allows one to restrict the analysis tothe relevant subset of firms and to account for the relevant role of geography in influencing industrial dynamics.The aim of the following section is to provide an operational solution to this issue, developing a new analyticaltool that allows to identify heterogeneous local responses to sector‐specific disturbances using a micro‐levelapproach. We use this novel technique to study space‐time patterns of producers’ performances in a specificindustry (the Italian wine sector) in response to a major regulatory change (the 2008 CMO reform). The Italian wineindustry is peculiar in that production is concentrated in a number of geographical clusters and most interactionstake place at the local level (De Marchi & Grandinetti, 2016): therefore, a purely sectoral approach is notappropriate to evaluate the geographical dynamics influencing producers’ reactions to an industry‐specific shock.The investigation is focused on the resistance phase, when local responses are expected to be more heterogeneous(Fingleton et al., 2012): using this strategy, we aim to capture both the spatial and temporal elements that arebelieved to influence local actors’ reactions to the perturbation. The empirical model is based on the estimation oftechnical efficiency, defined as the difference between the actual and the maximum level of production y given a setof inputs x, and combines spatial analysis with a panel endogenous stochastic frontier framework to verify whetherthe dynamics of firm‐level efficiency are influenced by the specific territorial context.3 | MODELING THE HETEROGENEOUS SPACE ‐TIME REACTIONS OFLOCAL ACTORS TO SHOCKS: THE GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED PANELSFA MODEL WITH ENDOGENOUS COVARIATESThe analysis of firm‐level inefficiency represents a widely used empirical tool to measure the deviation of observeddecision‐making units from an estimated or constructed production, cost, or profit frontier. Technical efficiency is656 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIusually defined as the difference between the actual and the maximum possible level of production y given a set ofinputs x (Farrell, 1957) and can be estimated using a large number of alternative models based on differentassumptions. Among these alternatives, parametric models, such as the stochastic frontier approaches, are oftenpreferred as they allow to implement inference on the conditional parameters of the model and to minimize theconcerns associated with potential omitted variable bias (see e.g., Baltagi, 2001).In the recent years, the traditional SFA framework has been modified and extended in several directions. One of themost remarkable strands of research focuses on the possibility to account for spatial effects in the estimation of technicalefficiency. The first attempt to address this issue was proposed by Druska and Horrace (2004), who extended the Kelejianand Prucha (1999) specification by assuming an autoregressive specification of the error term and estimating inefficiencywith the Generalized Method of Moments. Following this pioneering contribution, a number of SFA models have beendeveloped to account for spatial dependence, with two major groups emerging in the context of cross‐sectional data. Thefirst one explains the efficiency term using a set of exogenous determinants associated with spatial heterogeneity (Brehm,2013; Hughes, Lawson, Davidson, Jackson, & Sheng, 2011; Lavado & Barrios, 2010), while the second one accounts forspatial dependence through spatial autoregressive specifications, including the spatial lag in the dependent variable(Affuso, 2010; Glass, Kenjegalieva, & Paez‐Farrell, 2013; Glass, Kenjegalieva, & Sickles, 2014), in the inputs (Adetutu, Glass,Kenjegalieva, & Sickles, 2015), or in the efficiency term (Areal, Balcombe, & Tiffin, 2010; Fusco & Vidoli, 2013; Pavlyuk,2010, 2012, 2013; Tsionas & Michaelides, 2016).The literature on spatial SFA has recently been extended using panel data models (Glass, Kenjegalieva, &Sickles, 2016; Gude, Álvarez, & Orea, 2018; Jeleskovic & Schwanebeck, 2012; Mastromarco, Serlenga, & Shin,2016; Ramajo & Hewings, 2017; Tsukamoto, 2018). Despite providing significant advancements, none of the citedworks have specifically accounted for the possibility of having distinct temporal patterns associated withheterogeneous local responses: as discussed in the previous section, this limitation is especially relevant when firm‐level performance is evaluated after disturbances or shocks, as local actors’ responses are expected to varysignificantly in such circumstances. In this respect, the specifications proposed in the literature share the samelimitations of the original panel data model of Battese and Coelli (1992), which tends to be restrictive as it onlyallows inefficiency to change over time with the same functional form (exponential) and for all productive units.Another relevant issue that has not been addressed by the existing spatial frontier frameworks is the potentialendogeneity of the inputs, associated with reverse causality or omitted variable bias.2 Despite its impact on theconsistency of the estimators (Amsler, Prokhorov, & Schmidt, 2016), this important concern has been addressedonly recently in the SFA literature (Karakaplan & Kutlu, 2017a, 2017b; Kutlu, 2010; Tran & Tsionas, 2013), whiletraditional SFA models tend to ignore this potential bias.In an attempt to fill this gap, we propose a new spatial stochastic frontier model which addresses the two abovementioned issues and allows us to highlight the heterogeneous reactions of firms in turbulent circumstances. Morespecifically, the proposed specification, defined as the geographically weighted panel SFA with endogenouscovariates (GWR‐panel SFA), stands on two main pillars:• A GWR algorithm which allows to locally estimate the production function for each unit i;• A panel SFA specification that allows to overcome the potential endogeneity of inputs (Karakaplan & Kutlu,2017b).The GWR is a locally weighted regression in which the coefficients are nonparametric functions of longitude andlatitude or the straight line distance between each observation and the target points (McMillen, 2013): it can besummarized as a moving window approach and is an effective tool to overcome the spatial homogeneity assumption. Oneof the main advantages of this method is that it can be used to map parameter variations over space, separating local2The endogeneity issue is especially relevant when technical efficiency is estimated in the agricultural sector, given the presence of some determinants ofthe production process that are unobserved by the researcher, but observed by the farmer (Billé, Salvioni, & Benedetti, 2018).CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 657spatial differences in terms of each explanatory variable (Brunsdon, Fotheringham, & Charlton, 1999). The GWR approachhas also some limitations in that it is susceptible to the effects of multicollinearity (Wheeler & Tiefelsdorf, 2005), especiallywhen the correlation between the covariates is particularly high. Furthermore, the presence of curvilinear relationshipsmay produce false results of nonstationarity (Austin, 2007).Despite these limitations, GWR is generally preferred over alternative techniques such as spatial filtering, which ismore prone to overfitting and does not produce local parameters estimates with superior properties (Oshan & Fotheringham,2018). Therefore, the GWR method is still considered a reliable tool to explore nonstationarity and spatial interpolation(Paez, Long, & Farber, 2008) and to accommodate more complex frameworks (Chen, Deng, Yang, & Matthews, 2012).Locally weighted regressions are popular among regional and urban economists (Li &Mroz, 2013; Redfearn, 2009) andhave been recently used to locally estimate efficiency models using cross‐section data (Samaha & Kamakura, 2008; Tabak,Miranda, & Fazio, 2013). In an SFA setting, the GWR approach allows to fit specific models for each territorial locationrather than fitting a global panel SFA model. This local form of regression (Brunsdon et al., 1999; Fotheringham,Brunsdon, & Charlton, 2002) allows to estimate the marginal effects of the different covariates over space.The GWR model can be formally expressed as follows:β= ( ( )) + ϵ = …xy f lat long i n; , , 1, , ,i i i i i i (1)where (lati, longi) is the coordinates vector of the ith point in space and βi (lati, longi) is a realization of thecontinuous function β (lat, long) at point i. In this study, we combine the GWR approach with the endogenous SFAspecification proposed by Karakaplan and Kutlu (2017b): this method was developed as an extension of the originalmodel for cross‐sectional data (Karakaplan & Kutlu, 2017a) to solve the endogeneity problem of inputs in an SFApanel setting through a single‐stage approach. The model is expressed as follows:βδϕσ ρσ ρ σ⎧⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩⎪⎪⎪= ′ + − = … = …= + ϵ= ( ′ ) *⎡⎣ϵ̃ ⎤⎦≡ ⎡⎣⎢Ω ϵ ⎤⎦⎥~⎛⎝⎜⎡⎣⎤⎦⎡⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥⎞⎠⎟− ∕xx Zxy v su i n t Tu h uv vNI, 1, , ; 1, ,with00,,uit yit it itit it itit uit iititititvv v1 22(2)where yit ∈ + is the output of unit i at time t, xit ∈ +p is the vector of inputs, vit is the symmetric two‐sided errorrepresenting random effects, s is equal to 1 for production functions and −1 for cost functions and uit > 0 is theone‐sided error term which represents technical inefficiency.3 The covariates are split into three groups: xyit,the exogenous and endogenous variables explaining y; xit, the endogenous variables; and xuit, the exogenousand endogenous variables explaining u. The endogeneity of xit is corrected using Zit, the vector of all exogenousinstrumental variables.The GWR‐panelSFA model combines Equations 1 and 2, resulting in the following specification:βδϕσ ρσ ρ σ⎧⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩⎪⎪⎪⎪= ′ ( ) + − = … = …= + ϵ= ( )= ( ′ ) *⎡⎣ϵ̃ ⎤⎦≡ ⎡⎣⎢Ω ϵ ⎤⎦⎥~⎛⎝⎜⎡⎣⎤⎦⎡⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥⎞⎠⎟⋅⋅ ⋅− ∕xx Zxy w lat long v su i n t Tw f du h uv vNI, , 1, , ; 1, ,with00,,uit yit i i i i it itit it iti iit uit iititititvv v1 22(3)3The two‐sided residual term is usually assumed to be normally distributed: σ~ ( )v N 0, v2 while u is distributed as a half‐normal and is always positive:σ~ ( )+u N 0, u2 . The classical model also assumes that v and u are each identically independently distributed (iid) and the covariates in the model.658 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIwhere βi are the “unit specific” covariate coefficients and wi⋅ are the weights depending on a distance function di⋅.The model is estimated through a single‐stage approach, providing benefits in terms of modeling of the error termϵit and the inefficiency component vit: indeed, the latter can be instrumented according to the function h(⋅), xuit, andalso through *ui , that is the producer‐specific random component. Moreover, ρ is introduced in the variance‐covariance matrix of ϵit, allowing to model the correlation between ϵit and vit. This choice ensures uit and vit areconditionally independent given xit and Zit and addresses the potential endogeneity existing between the error termand the inefficiency component. Equation 3 can be estimated using a weighted panel SFA procedure. A flowdiagram of the estimation sequence is shown in Figure 1.The consistent local estimates of technical inefficiency obtained through the novel specification allow to moveto the final stage of the process, which involves the identification of the heterogeneous responses of firms to aspecific disturbance: this concluding step is critical to assess whether any detected asymmetries can be associatedwith specific territorial patterns and to isolate clusters of producers who perform similarly after the shock. Thepossibility to implement this analysis is associated with one of the strengths of the model, that is the possibility tostudy the local dynamics of technical efficiency for each producer over a specific period of time: followingBouveyron et al. (2015), we use the estimated temporal dummies on vit to implement a functional mixture modelwhich allows the clustering of the individual time trends in a discriminative functional subspace and thevisualization of the clustered systems.4 Using this approach, it is possible to initially obtain individual functionalcurves, representing individual smooth basis or single realizations of a latent functional process (Ramsay &Silverman, 2005). The data are then aggregated using clustering algorithms for finite dimensional data (Jacques &F IGURE 1 Flow diagram of the GWR‐panel SFA estimation sequence. GWR, geographically weightedregression; SFA, stochastic frontier analysis4Such an approach is one of the possible alternatives to estimate clusters of functional data. Alternative methodologies have been proposed by Sugar(2003) and applied by Ieva et al. (2013).CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 659Preda, 2014), in an attempt to identify similar spatial trends in the data. The main benefit of this procedure is thatspatial boundaries are not imposed a priori by the researcher, but rather identified through a data‐driven approachwhich captures the nonstationary nature of spatial processes. We can thus overcome one of the major limitationsassociated with the existing empirical contributions on resilience: indeed, regions are almost always identified usingadministrative boundaries, which tend to disguise the complexities of local networks.4 | AN APPLICATION TO THE ITALIAN WINE INDUSTRYThe purpose of this section is to use the GWR‐panel SFA approach to describe the recent dynamics of the Italianwine industry: as explained in the following subsection, firm‐level performances in this sector have been heavilyinfluenced by a major institutional change, generating heterogeneous responses in the different local contexts. Theempirical analysis is performed using an unbalanced panel of wine producers active during the 2009–2014 period,exploiting the benefits of a detailed database, whose structure is briefly described in Section 4.2. Given the periodconsidered in the analysis is the one immediately following a relevant regulatory change, the results will allow toevaluate the initial resistance of winemakers to this disturbance: according to the literature, it is expected to detecthigher asymmetry in the reaction of local actors during the years immediately following the disruption (Fingletonet al., 2012). Moreover, the role of territorial factors is expected to be particularly relevant in explaining resiliencedynamics: indeed, according to Battaglini et al. (2015), farm resilience is associable to the specific form in which thelocal community “reinterprets and transforms local heritage for its own use.” Hence, resilience can be described asa process in which the communities settling in a place “perceive the specific nature of that place, attributingsymbols to its resources and to its local peculiarities and thus reunifying, structuring and organizing it” (Paloviita &Jarvela, 2015).Given the above mentioned factors, the GWR‐panel SFA approach is expected to provide more support tointerpret the efficiency trends compared to the standard SFA frameworks. The model is preliminarily estimatedusing the traditional panel SFA approach (Section 4.3), which assumes a global trend for technical efficiency. Theanalysis shows the presence of significant spatial effects that are expected to affect the estimation ofthe inefficiency term. To address this issue, the GWR‐panel SFA model is used in Section 4.4: the results highlightthe effectiveness of the alternative approach in detecting the different dynamics of technical efficiency.4.1 | The Italian wine industry: Stylized facts and the impact of the 2008 CMO reformon producers’ performancesIn Italy, winemaking has a long‐established tradition and is the product of a vast, heterogeneous, and articulatedsector. Unlike other competing countries, Italy can rely on a large number of producers concentrated in territorialclusters and operating in a wide range of locations, including coastal plains, rolling hills, and mountainous areas. Asa result, wine production is extremely diversified in terms of enological typology, production technology, and unitvalue of products. The above determinants contribute to explain the leading position held by this country in theglobal market: in 2015, Italy’s share of world wine production was equal to 18.2%, generating a revenue of 12.9billion euro (International Organisation of Vine & Wine (OIV), 2017; Mediobanca, 2017). Italy is one of the leadingproducers in the EU, which is itself the largest global wine‐producing region and the main importer and exporter ofwine, but also a highly regulated market (Meloni & Swinnen, 2013).During the last two decades, the wine sector has witnessed profound changes in the competitive environment,driven by the emergence of New World producers (United States, Australia, Chile, Argentina, South Africa) in theglobal market (Cusmano, Morrison, & Rabellotti, 2010; Morrison & Rabellotti, 2017). The rise of these newcompetitors has often been associated with their superior ability to satisfy the emerging demand for more660 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIstandardized wines, exploiting the lack of rigid regulatory constraints such as those imposed by the EU (Itçaina,Roger, & Smith, 2016). The changing competitive scenario has negatively affected the main EU wine producers,including Italy, generating the need for a major reform to regain market share. In response to these pressures, theEU implemented the CMO reform, reorganizing the way the EU wine market was managed: the new law wasnegotiated remarkably quickly in the autumn of 2007 and adopted in April 2008 with little opposition from thegovernments of producer states and growers’ organizations (Itçaina et al., 2016). The reform had a major impact onthe sector, removing the strict regulation of enological practices and wine labeling and fostering the emergence of amarket‐driven approach focused on promotion, marketing, and structural investment. The new regulation wasaimed at stimulating market selection mechanisms, generating advantages for the most efficient wineries at theexpense of marginal producers (Morrison & Rabellotti, 2017).Given a prerequisite for any work on resilience is to properly identify a shock, a key question is whether theinstitutional change occurred in 2008 can be regarded as a significant disruption. A number of empirical methodologieshave been proposed in the literature to address this issue (Balland, Rigby, & Boschma, 2015). In this paper, we formallytest the presence of a shock in the Italian wine sector by implementing the Chow test (Chow, 1960) for the presence ofstructural breaks in a time series. Given the analysis is focused on technical efficiency, the test is implemented on laborproductivity data, focusing on the Italian wine industry, as well as on the manufacturing sector and the Italian economy forthe 2004–2016 period (Figure 2). The data are extracted from the Italian Bureau of Statistics (ISTAT) data warehouse(section Enterprises—Competitiveness). Monetary values are calculated in real terms, deflating nominal values with producerprice indices. The results of the test for year 2008 confirm the presence of a structural break in the wine industry(F=10.28, p< .05), whereas the null hypothesis of no structural break could not be rejected for the manufacturing sector(F=2.36, p= .21) and for the entire economy (F=2.17, p= .23). As expected, in the latter two cases the structural break issignificant for year 2009 and can be associated with the global financial crisis.In light of the above findings, it is reasonable to expect asymmetric reactions among wine producers in theyears immediately following the 2008. Such asymmetry is likely to be heavily influenced by local environmentalfactors, considering the strong linkages existing between agricultural activities and the territory, and the key roleplayed by soil, climatic, and morphological characteristics, but also by intangible factors, such as historical traditionsand the local learning processes, in explaining the performance dynamics of most farm holdings (Beebe, Haque,F IGURE 2 Labor productivity, wine industry, manufacturing industry and Italian economy, period 2004–2016[Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 661Jarvis, Kenney, & Patton, 2012; Morrison & Rabellotti, 2017; Turner, 2009; Vidoli, Cardillo, Fusco, & Canello, 2016).The relevance of the place in explaining local responses after shocks can also be explained through the influenceplayed by specific producers operating in the area: Giuliani et al. (2015) have provided evidence of the key roleplayed by anchor firms in supporting local wine producers during sudden and unexpected adversities.Given the above premises, a robust analysis of the performance dynamics in the winemaking sector should besupported by empirical tools which allow to account for the major influence played by spatial factors in determiningeconomic outcomes. In this respect, the structure of the GWR‐panel SFA approach seems to be particularlyappropriate for the aim of the proposed investigation.4.2 | Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) survey: the data source used forthe empirical analysisThe FADN is a yearly survey carried out by the Member States of the EU to systematically collect accountancy dataon incomes and business operations of agricultural holdings in the European Economic Community. This databaseincludes all the agricultural holdings having an economic size equal to or greater than a minimum threshold, that is,that identified to be considered commercial. The selection of the units taking part to the survey is carried outaccording to sampling plans defined at the national level, following the guidelines and recommendations providedby the European Commission to ensure the representativeness of the selected sample. The common methodologyapplied by all the Member States (Council Regulation (EC) No.: 1217/2009) aims to provide representative dataalong three dimensions: region, economic size, and type of farming.The Italian section of the survey is based on the Agricultural Census, updated on a 2‐year basis by the Farm StructureSurvey carried out by the ISTAT: this main data source is complemented with further sources of agricultural statistics. Themain benefits of this database are associated with the wide number of variables referring to physical and structural data,such as location, crop areas, livestock units, labor force, but also to the economic and financial information, such asthe value of production, stocks, sales and purchases, production costs, assets, liabilities, production quotas, and subsidies.More than 1,000 variables are present in the FADN survey, allowing to harmonize information within different countries.The survey has some limitations in that it tends to over represent commercial holdings and the publication of data issignificantly delayed (Hill, 2012; Keenleyside, Tucker, & McConville, 2010). Furthermore, the representativeness of thesample decreases when the focus moves from the regional to the provincial level (Gigante, Arfini, & Donati, 2014).In this paper, an unbalanced panel of 330 wine producers was extracted from the Italian FADN database for the2009–2014 period. The total number of observations over the 6 years is equal to 1,480, with information available forfour or more years in 75% of the considered cases. The sample includes farms classified as “specialist vineyards” (code 35)according to the TF14 Grouping classification, with the great majority of producers specialized in quality winemaking(subdivision 351). Most of these farms are small businesses registered as sole proprietorship (91%) and employing anaverage of only 2.5 workers. As already stated, this time period is of particular interest as it allows one to evaluate theeffects of the major structural transformations which have influenced the sector and affected farm holdings’ performance.Using this sample, the application presented in the following sections compares the results of the traditional panel SFAapproach with those of the GWR‐panel SFA model, showing the benefits associated with the use of the new methodology.4.3 | Technical efficiency estimation: Baseline model and identificationThe production function of the Italian wine producers is initially estimated using a panel SFA specification withtime‐varying inefficiency (Battese & Coelli, 1992) as the baseline model, focusing on the relationship betweenoutput and its main inputs.This model is the simplest yet most cited specification among the panel SFA models. Starting from thetraditional specification of the panel SFA:662 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIβ= ′ + − ∀xy v u iln , ,it it it it (4)where yit ∈ + is the output of unit i for time t, xit ∈ +p is the vector of inputs, vit is the symmetric two‐sided errorrepresenting random effects and uit > 0 is the one‐sided error term which represents technical inefficiency, Batteseand Coelli (1992) impose a specific pattern of temporal inefficiency variation for all producers, modeling uit = f(t)uiand defining f(t) = exp[η(t − T)], where T is the upper limit for time and η is the unknown parameter describing howinefficiency evolves over time. When η > 0, the efficiency level increases during the considered period. In all thefollowing sections, the production function is specified using total wine quantity produced (in tonnes) per year asthe dependent variable, while the following covariates are used to define the production technology and tomeasure technical efficiency:• Labor input = total number of hours worked per year;• Capital input—Machinery =machinery power (kW);• Capital input—Land = agricultural area (ha).Table 1 reports the results of the classical Battese and Coelli (1992) specification and shows that the covariatesare significantly different from zero and the signs are those expected. The values of the parameters (σ2 and γ)confirm the appropriateness of applying a SFA model: indeed, a relevant share of the deviation from the frontiercan be attributed to technical inefficiency (γ = 0.64), while only 36% or this variation is associable with noise.Furthermore, the variance of the error term σ( )u2 is half of that of the inefficiency term σ( )v2 . Last but not least, thecoefficient of the temporal pattern of efficiency η is not significant, suggesting that technical efficiency is time‐invariant in the sample of farm holdings considered.As discussed in Section 3, two major limitations are associated with this baseline specification. First, theassumption that the inputs are exogenous might be violated, given the three factors of production are possiblycorrelated with the output, the v term or both. In the context of agricultural production, explanatory variables canbe endogenous for a number of reasons (Amsler et al., 2016), including the fact that the farmer may be aware of hisv and this may affect his input choices. Second, assuming the presence of a single temporal pattern of performancesmight be an additional source of bias, considering the peculiarities of the sector and the presence of a majordisturbance during the time period considered: given the local responses of firms are expected to be highlyasymmetric, ignoring the spatial factors is likely to generate biased results. In other terms, our interpretation of thecoefficient of η might be biased by the presence of spatial nonstationarity in the data.TABLE 1 Estimation results using the Battese and Coelli (1992) approachCoef.

The maphighlights the presence of several homogeneous areas, both in Northern and Southern Italy, characterized bysimilar firm‐level efficiency scores: the zoom over the Central and Southern regions (Figure 3b) highlights someexamples of areas characterized by significant spatial patterns, with high‐efficiency scores for producers located inspecific neighborhoods. The presence of spatial correlation among efficiency scores is formally evaluated usingGeary C test5: the value of the statistic (0.61) suggests the presence of spatial similarities among territories andleads to reject the null hypothesis of spatial independence of farm holdings’ performances.In light of these findings, assuming the presence of a single global trend η for technical efficiency seemsinappropriate to evaluate the dynamics of firm‐level performances: this is particularly true considering that thetime frame of the survey follows a period of relevant structural and economic transformations and that theliterature has shown that local responses tend to be highly heterogeneous under these circumstances.4.4 | Technical efficiency estimation using the geographically weighted panel SFAapproach with endogenous covariatesThe results of the previous subsection highlight the need to implement an alternative approach to account for boththe endogeneity and the spatial nonstationarity in the data. In this respect, the GWR‐Panel SFA frameworkoutlined in Equation 3 seems particularly suitable to address the two issues emerged in the baseline model. In thissubsection, we preliminarily estimate the Karakaplan and Kutlu (2017b) model (Equation 2) to embed theendogeneity problem into the SF specification and to instrument the inefficiency term u; following this, weincorporate the GWR approach to locally estimate the model and to obtain local estimates for all parameters.(a) (b)F IGURE 3 Territorial distribution of the estimated panel SFA efficiency scores. SFA, stochastic frontier analysis[Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]5The value of Geary C lies between 0 and 2. Values lower than 1 provide evidence of increasing positive spatial autocorrelation, whereas values higherthan 1 indicate increasing negative spatial autocorrelation. C = 1 is consistent with no spatial autocorrelation in the data.664 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIThe results of the baseline endogenous model are reported in Tables 2 and 3. As shown in Table 2, thisspecification extends the baseline SFA model presented in the previous section in two major directions:1. It incorporates the 1‐year lags of the endogenous inputs in the instrumental frontier estimation to prevent theendogeneity bias, following a commonly used strategy in applied economics research (Reed, 2015) and inproductivity and efficiency analysis (Billé et al., 2018; Bolli et al., 2016; Wooldridge, 2009);2. It includes a set of firm‐level endogenous covariates to instrument the inefficiency term using a single‐stepapproach. This methodology removes the effect of factors linked to the individual production unit.The analysis of the results provides some important indications in support of the validity of the model: indeed,the comparison between the standard and the corrected specification (Table 3) shows how the input coefficientsTABLE 2 Estimation results using the endogenous panel stochastic frontier analysis approach in the style ofKarakaplan and Kutlu (2017b)Coef.

The presence of endogeneity is formally tested using thestandard Durbin–Wu–Hausman test, which leads to reject the null hypothesis of no endogenous inputs: therefore,endogeneity is present in the data and correction for this bias is needed to obtain consistent estimates of thefrontier. It is also worth noting that the set of firm‐level covariates included in the model is significant and the signsare consistent with our expectations. The analysis of the estimated effects confirms some previous relevantfindings of the literature: more specifically, a higher relative amount of EU subsidies received by the farm isassociated with a lower level of technical efficiency (positive sign of the coefficient): this finding is consistent withthe results of the meta‐analysis implemented by Minviel and Latruffe (2017), showing that in most cases subsidiesare found to be detrimental for the performances of agricultural producers. The percentage of land owned by thefarmer is another relevant factor in our analysis, consistently with Amsler et al. (2016): not surprisingly, a largershare of land ownership is likely to improve the performances of wine producers, and this can be associated with anumber of factors, including the higher incentives to invest (Feder & Onchan, 1987; Jacoby, Li, & Rozelle, 2002).Finally, a smaller size and the location in a disadvantaged area in terms of slope inclination and slope exposurenegatively affects firm‐level performances.6TABLE 3 Endogenous versus exogenous panel stochastic frontier analysis regression resultsExogenous model Endogenous modelDependent variable: ln(Output) Frontier estimationConstant 0.819*** −0.238 0.239 −0.223Labor input (log) 0.306*** −0.037 0.425*** −0.036Machinery input (log) 0.142*** −0.039 0.109** −0.04Land input (log) 0.513*** −0.035 0.468*** −0.028Dependent variable: σ( )ln u2 Inefficiency termConstant 0.472 −0.242 0.402 −0.245Dummy year 2010 −0.020 −0.102 −0.023 −0.112Dummy year 2011 0.015 −0.093 0.017 −0.102Dummy year 2012 0.059 −0.095 0.075 −0.104Dummy year 2013 0.015 −0.095 0.038 −0.103Dummy year 2014 0.099 −0.095 0.120 −0.104Size (revenues in million euro) −6.107*** −1.122 −7.399*** −1.372Subsidies received from the EU (% of revenues) 0.027*** −0.005 0.029*** −0.006% of land owned −0.004* −0.002 −0.005* −0.002Slope disadvantage 0.413* −0.183 0.457* −0.188Dependent variable: σ( )ln v2Constant −1.877*** −0.046Dependent variable: σ( )ln w2Constant −1.845*** −0.046η endogeneity test χ2 = 21.01 p = .000Asterisks indicate significance at the ***0.1%, **1% and *5% levels.6Additional estimations were conducted to evaluate the role played by two important determinants of technical efficiency. First, the organizational formchosen by the farm holding was considered, following the recent findings in the literature on the role of this factor in influencing performance in the wineindustry (Brandano, Detotto, & Vannini, 2019; Maietta & Sena, 2010). Second, a proxy for climatic conditions was also considered as a possibledeterminant for technical efficiency. The proxy we identified was a dummy variable associated to the “climate disadvantage,” defined according to a set ofcriteria defined by the European Commission (Jones, Reid, & Vilks, 2012). This proxy is based on four agroclimatic indicators related to the averagetemperatures and soil dryness (regardless of the crop type). The results of the estimations, available upon request, show that these two variables are notsignificant in explaining performance differences in the considered sample.666 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIOnce the endogeneity issue is addressed, the following step is to integrate the GWR approach in theKarakaplan and Kutlu (2017b) model and locally estimate the coefficients according to Equation 3; as explained inSection 3, the procedure requires the preliminary identification of a vector of n − 1 weights wi⋅ for each firm, whichis based on the distances between unit i and the other n − 1 producers. In this application, the spatial weights arecalculated using the OpenStreetMap software, identifying the point to point time distances between the vineyardsalong the road network with the default maximum speed for trucks7: the main advantage of this approach is that itallows to account for the orography of the territory and to evaluate the actual distances between the firms that areincluded in the sample. The weight vector wi⋅ is subsequently used to estimate n weighted frontiers (one for eachunit i) and to identify n different values for the coefficients of both the covariates and instrumental variables.Figure 4 provides a first piece of evidence of the validity of the specification. The graph shows how the values ofinput coefficients vary significantly depending on where the model is estimated: the only exception is representedby the land input, whose elasticities appear to remain stable regardless of the area where the estimation isperformed. Conversely, the elasticities of both machinery and labor inputs appear to be heavily affected by thelocation of the farm holding. Overall, the results highlight the presence of spatial nonstationarity that is inevitablyoverlooked when a global production function is estimated.4.5 | Space‐time patterns of farms’ performances and the role of environmental andinstitutional factorsThe consistent local estimates obtained through the novel approach proposed in this paper can be used to derivedifferent temporal patterns of farm‐level efficiency: in this specific application, the presence of different dynamicsF IGURE 4 Kernel distribution of the input coefficients β varying reference unit i [Color figure can be viewed atwileyonlinelibrary.com]7We would like to thank the Geodienst group of the University of Groningen for the support provided to calculate the distance matrix.CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 667mirror the heterogeneous responses of wine producers to a specific institutional change, that is, the 2008 CMOreform. To derive these heterogeneous patterns, we extract the estimated temporal dummies on vit for the2009–2014 period, using the 2009 as reference year, and we apply a functional mixture model to cluster theindividual time trends in a discriminative functional subspace (Ramsay & Silverman, 2005).Figure 5a shows the smooth basis functions for each wine producer i included in the sample, highlighting thepresence of three groups of homogeneous temporal patterns identified through the clustering approach. The threemain trends are summarized using an individual trend curve for each cluster in Figure 5b and shows the presence ofthree groups of farm holdings which responded differently during the period following the 2008 CMO reform. Thefirst two homogeneous groups include the majority of wine producers and highlight the presence of some clearlydistinguished territorial patterns. On the one hand, Cluster 1 is mainly populated by those farms which experienceda declining trend after the institutional transition, with negative performances especially in the period following2011; on the other hand, Cluster 2 includes those producers who managed to achieve more stable performancesafter 2008, showing higher levels of resilience to the institutional shock. Finally, Cluster 3 identifies a small group ofwinemakers which have significantly increased their efficiency, especially in the period immediately following 2008.The geographical distribution by functional cluster (Figure 6) highlights the presence of specific territoriescharacterized by homogeneous temporal patterns of technical efficiency: for example, producers operating in theMontepulciano (Abruzzo) and Lison Pramaggiore (Friuli) regions appear to belong almost entirely to Cluster 2,while the Marsala (Sicily), the Langhe (Piedmont), and the Collio (Friuli) regions are characterized by thewidespread presence of firms belonging to Cluster 1. Figure 6 also show that farms of Cluster 3 tend to beterritorially scattered throughout the country and suggest that their performances are driven by their individualstrategies rather than by the influence of their local peers: however, it is also worth noting that these producers aremore likely to be located in areas characterized by higher levels of resilience. An important takeaway from thisanalysis is that regional industrial resilience can be investigated more effectively when the territorial boundariesare identified through a data‐driven approach rather than being imposed a priori: this aspect emerges distinctly forsome areas such as Friuli and Veneto (Figure 6b), where the spatial patterns are found to be significantly differenteven within the same region.F IGURE 5 Smooth trend basis and functional clusters [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]668 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIAs a final step of this analysis, we verify whether the heterogeneous space‐time patterns identified in the data canbe associated with a set of exogenous factors that are generally linked with higher levels of resilience in the literature.This exploratory evidence is provided using a simple t test of the difference between means in the clusters identifiedby the procedure. The analysis is focused on Clusters 1 and 2, that is, the two groups where the majority of farmholdings are included. The set of environmental and institutional variables selected for the analysis includes:• Social capital: share of local population employed in the nonprofit sector,• Institutional quality: administrative capability of local government,• Export propensity: value of exports per capita in the region,• Value added: value added per capita in the region,• Firm mortality: share of firms that did not survive at the end of the year,• Innovation propensity: number of patents registered at the European Patent Office for millions of inhabitants,• Risk of financing: risk level associated with loans provided to firms in the region,• Unemployment rate: people aged 15 or more looking for occupation over total labor force.The data refer to the province where the farm is located and are extracted from the ISTAT website. Informationon institutional quality is retrieved from Nifo and Vecchione (2014). The environmental and institutional variablesare calculated for 2008, which is the year in which the CMO reform was adopted by all the EU member countries,including Italy.The results of the tests, reported in Figure 7 and Table 4, show that the mean value of some of the selectedvariables is significantly different in the two clusters considered. More specifically, the group of relatively betterperforming farm holdings (Cluster 2) is located in areas characterized by higher propensity to export, lowerunemployment rates and lower risk of financing, which is generally associated with more access to credit. In this(a) (b)F IGURE 6 Territorial distribution of wine producers by functional cluster [Color figure can be viewed atwileyonlinelibrary.com]CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 669F IGURE 7 Kernel distribution and average values of environmental and institutional variables, functionalcluster 1 vs 2 [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]670 | CANELLO AND VIDOLIrespect, our findings support those of previous contributions in the literature, showing that resilient firms tend tobe located in areas characterized by higher competitiveness even before the shock (Fratesi & Rodríguez‐Pose,2016). Nonetheless, it is also worth highlighting that certain contextual factors generally associated with higherlevels of resilience (such as social capital, institutional quality, and innovation propensity) are not found to besignificantly different in the two main clusters considered. This finding suggests that the dynamics of a specificindustry might not always mirror that of the entire region or of the entire economy, and that macro‐environmentaland institutional factors might not necessarily be sufficient to explain better performances of a specific subset ofproducers located in a specific subregion. In this respect, the empirical approach to be used to explain regionalindustrial resilience using firm‐level data should be different from that proposed to interpret regional resiliencefrom a macro perspective.5 | FINAL REMARKSThis paper has introduced and discussed a new empirical procedure to investigate space‐time patterns of regionalindustrial resilience using a micro‐level approach. Our geographically weighted panel SFA model with endogenouscovariates adds a new dimension to our current understanding of economic resilience, providing a robust empiricaltool to evaluate territorial performance dynamics after a sector‐specific disturbance through a firm‐levelperspective. The recent empirical contributions in this field of research suggest that shocks often triggerasymmetric responses among the affected actors, generating patterns that tend to be homogeneous within thesame territory and heterogeneous between different regions: in this respect, the new methodology is particularlybeneficial in that it allows to identify spatial regimes of firms who display similar performances after a specificdisturbance, without relying on territorial boundaries imposed a priori.The procedure has been tested on a sample of farm holdings operating in the Italian wine industry for the2009–2014 period. This sector is relevant for the present analysis for two main reasons: first, the role of spatialfactors is particularly prominent, considering the strong connections existing between agricultural activities andthe local territories, as well as the key role played by climatic and morphological characteristics but also byhistorical traditions in explaining the performance dynamics of most wine producers (Morrison & Rabellotti, 2017).Second, the European wine industry has been affected by a major restructuring after 2008, following the CMOreform adopted by the EU to address the persisting oversupply of wine and stimulate the development of efficientpractices in the sector: this institutional shock is believed to have had a major impact on most wine producers,triggering heterogeneous responses in the different regions.The results show the effectiveness of the new procedure in identifying spatial heterogeneity, while correctingfor endogeneity in the data. More specifically, the values of input coefficients for wine production are found to varyTABLE 4 Welch two sample t test, functional cluster 1 versus 2Variable by functional cluster (1 vs. 2) t test df p value Mean cluster 1 Mean cluster 2Institutional quality −0.130 198.82 0.895 0.384 0.386Export propensity −2.842 200.92 0.005 6209.295 7792.936Firm mortality 0.868 242.66 0.386 0.072 0.071Social capital −0.434 219.80 0.664 4.323 4.401Risk of financing 4.143 242.47 0.001 2.091 1.677Innovation propensity −0.475 193.99 0.634 64.482 68.588Unemployment rate 3.770 276.61 0.001 7.300 5.811Value added −0.609 178.67 0.542 12495.18 13417.96CANELLO AND VIDOLI | 671significantly depending on where the model is estimated, highlighting the presence of spatial nonstationarity that isinevitably overlooked when a global production function is estimated.
