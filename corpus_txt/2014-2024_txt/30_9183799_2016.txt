Western Urban and Local Governance Research Papers http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/urbancentre/ 21 June 2016  3 Executive Summary Greater Toronto is recognized as a high-performing urban region. Over the past decade, however, negative social, economic, and environmental trends have emerged that threaten the region’s future. On the basis of documentary research and four focus group workshops with a diverse array of professional practitioners, this paper assesses the Toronto region’s current assets and vulnerabilities in relation to future risks. The discussion is framed by the concept of resilience—an increasingly popular, yet abstract, concept in urban planning and public administration. This paper proposes, first, that planning and policymaking be directed toward increasing the region’s resilience, understood as the diversity and redundancy of social, economic, environmental, and fiscal-governmental systems. Second, it suggests that public resource allocation be guided by what some have called anticipatory governance—the proactive use of scenarios to discover where multiple risks and vulnerabilities intersect, and therefore where returns may be greatest. Finally, the paper suggests that an appeal to improving quality of life rather than to crisis or individual self-interest may be the most effective way to build broad support for long-term investments in resilience-enhancing infrastructure and services.     4 Table of Contents Introduction ....................................................................................................................................... 5	1.

There is a sense that it has arrived on the world stage—that it is a high-performing and rapidly growing global city with an enviable economic, social, and environmental record. Toronto routinely scores near the top of international quality-of-life and business climate rankings. Over the past decade, however, worrisome trends have emerged that may threaten the region’s future performance: rising rates of poverty and socio-economic inequality, lagging innovation and productivity, a growing infrastructure deficit, inadequate social and economic integration of new Canadians, and concern about the adaptability of the region’s built and natural environments to rising energy costs, climate change, and an ageing society. All of these and more pose difficult and unresolved policy dilemmas for all levels of government.  It is in this context that the Project on Regional Resilience was initiated with support from the Ontario Growth Secretariat and the Toronto chapter of the Urban Land Institute to provide an integrated diagnosis of the challenges the region faces and spur creative thinking on how best to respond to them. The investigation of the region’s challenges, assets, and vulnerabilities synthesizes research by academics, governments, and non-profit organizations with the findings of four thematic workshops with diverse groups of professionals selected on the basis of their area of expertise. This project is not a benchmarking exercise. It is not intended to systematically compare the performance of the Toronto region to that of other regions. Indeed, there is no shortage of such city ranking studies (see Taylor 2011). Rather, the intention is to develop a “within-case” perspective on the region’s strengths, weaknesses, and threats. The discussion is framed in terms of resilience. Resilience is a useful approach to urban policy because it recognizes complexity, interconnectedness, and uncertainty, all of which cloud the ability of planners and policymakers to anticipate, mitigate, or otherwise respond to present and future challenges. Although resilience is an increasingly influential concept in public policy and planning, it is often discussed in the abstract and there are divergent perspectives on its practical application. In addition to exploring Toronto’s current conditions and future potential, this paper also contributes to local and international debates in planning and public policy by presenting a practice-oriented model of urban resilience.  The paper places special emphasis on policymaking for the built and natural environments for two reasons. First, the physical city, with its buildings, roads, rails, pipes, wires, and open spaces, is the container for social and economic life. The construction of the urban built and natural environment is a largely irreversible process. As its structure shapes human behaviour—how we live, interact with others, move, work, and play—and, ultimately, prosperity and quality of life, it is important that planners and policymakers make the best possible decisions regarding its design. Second, the project was initiated in the context of a now completed coordinated review of provincial land-use policies 6 (Ontario 2015). To contribute to the review, a series of focus-group workshops with expert practitioners was financially supported by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing with a Places to Grow Implementation Grant. An earlier draft of this paper was presented to the Ministry as an input to the review. The remainder of the paper is divided into three parts. Part 1 lays out a practice-oriented definition of resilience and how it can be applied in public policy for urban regions. On the basis of the practitioner workshops and background research, Part 2 uses the resilience framework to inventory the Toronto region’s assets and vulnerabilities in relation to future challenges, with a particular focus on the built environment. Finally, Part 3 draws on the workshop discussions to reflect on the political challenge of selling resilience to a skeptical public. The paper concludes with a reflection on applying resilience-oriented planning and policymaking in the Ontario context. 1. Governing for resilience Governments, private-sector consultants, non-profit organizations, and academics have in recent years embraced resilience as an organizing principle for urban policy and planning. The term is used in different ways, however, so it is worth examining its meaning. What is resilience?  The application of resilience to the urban and metropolitan contexts is a recent phenomenon that has emerged from a variety of sources. In the natural and applied sciences, resilience is conceptualized as a measurable intrinsic property of a substance or system (see Holling 1996). Engineers have long studied the relative capacity of materials to return to their original state after being exposed to stress. Biologists and ecologists have examined how ecosystems maintain their essential functions despite disturbance. Psychologists have studied the determinants of the capacity to respond to stress and trauma of individual people and in particular children (Werner 1989). Social scientists’ application of resilience is often more metaphorical. Economists and economic geographers have studied the determinants of urban economies’ rapid recovery and growth in the context of recession (Christopherson, Michie, and Tyler 2010; Pike, Dawley, and Tomaney 2010). Similarly, resilience has emerged as a guiding concept in natural disaster preparedness. There is some evidence of convergence among approaches. For example, socio-ecological systems researchers have probed the interaction of human society and natural environments, particularly in relation to climate change adaptation (Boyd and Folke 2012).   Urban resilience—the resilience of cities, broadly defined—is typically portrayed as a property or capacity of urban economies, societies, and environments. For example, the Urban Land Institute’s Urban Resilience Program, the Brookings Institution and the 7 MacArthur Foundation’s Building Resilient Regions Network, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, and the European Union’s TURAS project, among others, have used resilience as a metaphor to explore the determinants of an urban region’s successful response to predictable and unforeseen challenges. By understanding the determinants of resilience, decision makers can assess and design policies to remedy gaps in preparedness. The research varies, however, on how it characterizes the operation and outcomes of resilience.1  Three versions of resilience are visible in the literature.   1. Resilience as the capacity to bounce back to normal from external shocks. The simplest definition of resilience is the capacity to “bounce back” to an initial state after experiencing a traumatic event. In essence, resilient cities may bend under stress but do not break, and come out much as they were before. In her book The Resilience Dividend (2014), Rockefeller Foundation president Judith Rodin defines resilience as the capacity to “prepare for disruptions, to recover from shocks and stresses, and to adapt and grow from a disruptive experience” (3). In this vein, the Brookings Institution’s Metro Monitor project measures whether U.S. metropolitan areas have returned to their pre-recession levels of total employment, unemployment rates, economic output, and average house price (Friedhoff and Kulkarni 2014). Focusing on natural disaster, the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives defines resilience as the ability to “absorb disturbances while retaining the same basic structure and ways of functioning” (ICLEI n.d.). Similarly, the Urban Land Institute defines resilience as “the ability to define and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more successfully adapt to adverse events” (McCormick and Marshall 2015: 2). The policy objective in this context is to minimize the potential impact of a shock, such as a 100-year flood, by “hardening,” or increasing the robustness of, infrastructure systems.  2. Resilience as the capacity to be positively transformed by shocks and stresses. Resilience has also been defined as the capacity to transform, or “bounce forward,” through crises, arriving at a new stable state that is different from before. For example, a resilient urban economy may be restructured by recession, but attain higher employment and labour market productivity in the medium to long term. The policy objective in this case is to create incentives and transitional supports, and make capital investments that encourage positive transformation. For example, governments have encouraged the formation of higher-value-added manufacturing activities by subsidizing training and skills development, creating tax incentives for venture capital investment, and constructing new infrastructure.                                             1 For an comprehensive review of the urban resilience literature, see Meerow et al. (2016). 8  These are typically described as “equilibrium” models. Both imply that there is stability before and after the city experiences an external shock, and that resilience is a capacity that determines how quickly it returns to its previous stable condition, or a new one.2 The policy and governance challenge is to anticipate potential shocks and recover quickly when they occur. A third conceptualization of resilience takes a different approach, drawing from ecosystem theory to reject the notion of stable equilibrium altogether:  3. Resilience as a capacity to adapt to risks and uncertainty. Resilient cities are complex adaptive systems that continuously adapt to changing conditions. Rather than planning for or engineering an optimal future end-state, the governance challenge is to accept uncertainty. Policymaking is a learning process of assessing and managing risks, while remaining open to a range of possible futures (see Walker and Salt 2012).   Understanding the city as an adaptive system means recognizing the interdependence of its components. The functioning and performance of the economy, society, and built and natural environments are connected in complex ways, and so change in one domain will have expected and unexpected ripple effects in others. Managing risks requires an appreciation of complexity and the potential for unanticipated consequences. It is in this vein that we offer this definition of regional resilience: A resilient urban region is one in which public and private authorities have the capacity to strategically prepare for unexpected future risks while managing avoidable ones. The governance challenge is to create institutions and make policies that anticipate and adapt to both slow-moving and sudden changes, while recognizing the complex interdependencies between a region’s social organization, economy, built and natural environments, and governance. Is resilience the same as sustainability? Importantly, resilience is conceptually distinct from another buzzword, sustainability. In the Brundtland Commission’s (1987) classic definition, “sustainable development … meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Sustainability is therefore about the wise management of resources to keep things much as they are. It is possible to be sustainable without being resilient, although in the context of resource depletion and climate change it is often argued that sustainability is a prerequisite of resilience (see Atmanagara et al. 2013; Newman, Beatley, and Boyer 2009; Newton and Doherty 2014).                                             2 Pendall et al. (2010) characterize these as the single-equilibrium, or “engineering” model, and the multiple-equilibrium, or “ecological” model, respectively. Chandler (2014: 5–6) views the first two “equilibrium” models as versions of what he calls “classical” resilience. 9 Types of risk Up to this point risk and uncertainty have been discussed in the abstract. If resilience is the foundation of an urban region’s capacity to manage risks and cope with uncertainty, it is necessary to sketch out what these might be. To do so, we must make distinctions between sudden shocks and slow shifts, and also between internal and external sources of risk and uncertainty.   Sudden shocks are discrete events that put stress on existing urban systems. These may include extreme weather events, economic crisis, or the failure of critical infrastructure. Slow shifts, by contrast, are slow moving or cumulative sources of stress. These may include climate change, long-term economic restructuring processes, demographic shifts, pollution, and the ageing of buildings and infrastructure.3 Sudden shocks and slow shifts can be driven by internal or external processes. Internal risks and sources of uncertainty are generated by the urban region’s characteristics, while external risks come from outside. Table 1 lists examples of each permutation.4  Chelleri et al. (2015) write that resilience-building necessarily engages multiple spatial scales and time horizons because risks manifest at different speeds and over different territories. Individuals, households, neighbourhoods and urban regions are subject to transnational and even global economic and social forces as technological change increases the connectedness of places and accelerated flows of capital, goods, and labour. This perspective suggests that vulnerability increases at smaller scales. To be sure, local and provincial policymakers have varying degrees of influence over each of these categories of risk. They have no influence over large-scale external processes such as macroeconomic shifts or climate change, although they may be able to anticipate and mitigate their impacts. Provincial, regional, and local governments have more direct influence over internal factors, such as the state of infrastructure and land use. Unlike capital, labour, and goods, the built environment is immobile. It is this immobility that makes it both vulnerable to external risks and the key to their mitigation.                                             3 The distinction between sudden shocks and slow shifts corresponds to Pendall et al.’s (2010: 80) contrast between “acute shocks” and “chronic slow-burn” challenges. 4 The boundary between internal and external risks may be blurry. A communicable disease such as measles, for example, is more likely to be imported from outside than originate locally, however its spread in the local population is a function of internal factors, such as vaccination rates and population density. Also, we must recognize that some sudden shocks are the cumulative effect of slow shifts. To cite some examples, a housing shortage may be a product of demographic change, an extreme weather event or flood may be the result of climate change, and a catastrophic bridge collapse may be the outcome of long-term underinvestment in infrastructure maintenance. 10 Table 1: Types of risk  Sudden shocks Slow shifts Internal • Infrastructure failure • Epidemic • Human-made disaster (e.g., industrial pollution event, train crash) • Closure of a large employer • Civil unrest (e.g., intergroup violence, rioting) • Rising poverty and socio-economic polarization, declining social mobility  • Increasing traffic congestion • Ageing infrastructure and building stock • Urbanization of rural land External • Natural disaster (e.g., earthquake) • Extreme weather event (e.g., hurricane) • Economic recession • Liquidity crisis • National politics and policy (e.g., sudden changes in monetary policy, interest rates, tax rates, fiscal choices, immigration policy) • International politics and policy (e.g., trade war, military action, terrorist attack) • Currency appreciation/devaluation • Rapid change in energy prices • Transformative technological innovation • Macrodemographic change (e.g., ageing society, declining household size) • Changing societal norms and values • Changing volume and sources of domestic and international migration  • Climate change (e.g., rising sea levels, rising temperatures, drought) • Invasive species • Macroeconomic restructuring (e.g., deindustrialization, shift to service economy) • Resource scarcity or depletion (e.g., fossil fuels, industrial commodity inputs) • Accumulation of pollutants in air, water, land, plants, and animals  Identifying risks is a necessary precursor to mitigating them, however this occurs in an environment of temporal uncertainty. The future is to some extent unknowable. The more distant the time horizon, the greater the uncertainty. Still, the cumulative nature or potential “long tails” of decisions must be taken into account. Reflecting on his prior work on the Greater Toronto Airport Authority’s long-term plan for Pearson Airport, workshop participant Toby Lennox put it this way: “We didn’t know what would happen in 50 or 100 years. The one thing we did know is that if we didn’t get the first 20 years right, the next 20 years wouldn’t really matter, because we’d be playing catch up anyway.”  Determinants of resilience A review of recent academic and professional literature in economic geography, disaster preparedness and recovery, international development, and urban and regional planning shows that an urban region’s resilience is a product of its social, governmental, economic, and physical characteristics. Consider the archetype of the sudden shock: the natural 11 disaster. Rapid recovery requires an honest and competent public administration that can maintain social order and allocate resources in times of crisis. Mitigation prior to the event is equally important: the planning and construction of built environments and infrastructure systems that minimize damage. Recovery is also aided by social cohesion: networks and institutions outside of government that facilitate cooperation among strangers. Campanella and Godschalk (2012), for example, compare two large-scale power outages that occurred in New York City. In the 1965 blackout, which occurred in a time of economic growth and optimism, “strangers aided one other in the streets and the city was enveloped by a sense of collective goodwill and common purpose” (218). Twelve years later, in a time of economic decline and social conflict, a second citywide blackout sparked widespread looting and other lawlessness. Social cohesion, supported by prosperity, mattered.    Table 2 lists commonly cited characteristics of socially, economically, and environmentally resilient urban regions. As in the New York City example, these characteristics are viewed as complementary. Cities with strong social capital; stable, efficient, and honest public administration; a diversified economy; flexible labour markets; and well-maintained infrastructure perform better in times of economic recession. Cities with robust land-use and infrastructure planning and efficient public administration are better prepared for, and respond more effectively to, natural disasters. Many of these characteristics can be viewed as products of two factors: redundancy and diversity. Redundancy is the notion that systems configured as networks are better able to function under stress than those configured as hierarchies or chains. If one part of a network fails, the load can be transferred to another part; if the weakest link in a chain breaks, the failure is complete.   Diversity is also important. Drawing on his expertise in electricity production and transmission networks, workshop participant Andrew Pietrewicz remarked that redundancy without diversity accomplishes little, because duplicates of the same system component will fail when subjected to the same stress: “Redundancy is a pillar of resilience,” he said. “But it is only sensible when it is linked to diversity as well. There has to be a diversity of options. Otherwise the one feature is simply twice as vulnerable.” For this reason, energy planners seek to diversify energy sources to ensure consistent supply while creating multiple redundant transmission lines to ensure that delivery can continue even if some fail.  While this logic is often applied to physical distribution systems for networked goods such as natural gas, water and sewer, wired and wireless communication, and mobility systems, it also applies to administrative and decision-making structures. Resilient public- and private-sector organizations are capable of efficiently foreseeing and making sense of challenges and allocating resources to mitigate them (Sutcliffe and Christianson 2011). Without redundant and diverse capacities for decision-making, communication, and implementation, institutions may be reactive rather than proactive and fail to learn from 12 experience. Worse, they may be ineffective or even collapse in times of crisis (Sutcliffe and Vogus 2003). In the workshop discussion, Aderonke Akande spoke about recent work through the City of Toronto’s Tower Renewal program that aims to formalize some of the structures of support that have emerged organically in some tower communities. During the ice storm in the winter of 2014–2015, some communities experienced long power outages. Building managers and tower residents set up stations with generators, provided food, and checked on people who were isolated in their units while the elevators were down. The City is drawing lessons from this community-level organizing to ensure that the resilience those communities demonstrated during a time of crisis can be shared with others, and built upon to minimize future risks and enhance people’s quality of life.  Table 2: Commonly cited characteristics of resilient cities Social Governmental/ Fiscal Economic Physical/ Environmental • Social cohesion / social capital • Social mobility / relative income equality • Access to affordable housing • Access to education • Access to social supports and health care • Political stability • Rule of law  • Honest government • Efficient public administration • Redundant communication and emergency response capacities • Awareness of risks, assets, and vulnerabilities • Integrated decision making processes • Fiscal capacity • Flexibility (capacity to dynamically reallocate resources) • Broad public participation • Locational advantage (factor endowments, proximity to markets) • Agglomeration economies (city size) • Diverse economic base • Skilled and productive labour force • Well-maintained infrastructure • Low energy costs • Low transportation congestion costs • Advantageous location • Proximity to markets  • Access to potable water • Food security • Robust long-term land-use planning • Adaptable land-use patterns  Redundancy and diversity are a hard sell in today’s political environment in which public-sector efficiency is identified with the elimination of overlap and duplication and the construction of “lean” processes and organizations. An alternative way of thinking about redundancy and diversity is to shift the focus from costs to returns on investment. To do so, we can borrow a concept from the financial world: the portfolio as a risk management 13 tool. Investment portfolios are designed to minimize risk to future returns by diversifying the financial instruments they contain. For example, much like a mutual fund, an infrastructure network such as an electricity grid or transportation network can be thought of as a portfolio of assets that is resilient to stress by virtue of its internal diversity and redundancy.   Can resilience be measured? Several think tanks and consultancies have developed or are developing quantitative indices of resilience with the goal of comparing cities. The Rockefeller Foundation in partnership with Arup International Development has developed a City Resilience Index that measures cities’ capacities to respond to stresses and challenges (Arup 2014b, 2015). Similarly, London-based real estate firm Grosvenor has published indices of city vulnerability and adaptive capacity that combine to form a city resilience index score (Grosvenor 2014). The MacArthur Foundation and the Brookings Institution supported the Building Resilient Regions project at the University of California at Berkeley, which developed a Regional Capacity Index for all 361 American Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MacArthur Foundation n.d.; Weir et al. 2012). In each case, a composite index score is calculated from a range of variables, some of which are derived from publicly available statistics, and others from subjective assessments.  A related endeavour is the assessment by insurance companies of external risks to city-regional economic output (Reguly 2013; Sundermann, Schelske, and Hausmann 2013). Lloyd’s City Risk Index, which is based on analytic techniques developed at Cambridge University, calculates the potential value of GDP that would be lost in 301 cities between 2015 and 2025 due to 18 human-caused and natural threats, including draught, extreme weather event, pandemic, cyber-attack, earthquake, and nuclear accident (Lloyd's 2015).  Toronto and other Canadian cities score relatively well on these indices. Toronto and Vancouver score first and second, respectively, in the Grosvenor city resilience index, which included 50 cities. Due to its anemic recovery from the Great Recession, Toronto scored only 117th of 300 in Brookings’ 2009–14 Global Metro Monitor—better than Vancouver (132nd) and Montreal (184th), and about the same as Calgary (115th). Lloyd’s estimates that $16 billion, or 6%, of Toronto’s GDP is at risk to disaster—similar to Boston and Atlanta, but considerably less than New York or London. According to their model, market crash, cyber-attack, and pandemic are the three largest risks Toronto faces. While these benchmarks may reveal variation over time and between cities, we suggest that the greater promise of the resilience concept is to inform anticipatory policymaking. 14 Anticipatory governance Adopting a portfolio approach challenges policymakers and planners to rethink established processes and practices. Traditionally, our approach has been to “predict and plan”: to identify a preferred outcome or end-state and allocate resources to make it happen.5 As Ahern (2011: 341) puts it, conventional planning has “tended toward a static conception—where sustainability was envisioned as a durable, stable, sometimes formulaic ‘fail-safe’ urban form or condition that—once achieved—could persist for generations.”  One danger of working toward a singular future outcome is the failure to anticipate unforeseen risks that may derail it (Hall 1980). Consider the example of Sydney, Australia, which in the 1960s prepared a plan that allocated future population and physical urban development under prevailing assumptions about average household size. Within a decade, average household size had dramatically declined due to broad societal changes, including the feminization of the workforce, availability of birth control, longer lifespans, and so on. The result: while the population forecast proved accurate, mature suburban areas were occupied at 80% of initial planned densities, with obvious implications for service demand (Meyer 2003). Another case of faulty assumptions generating long-term unintended consequences is that of Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota, whose regional planning agency in 1964 forecast a population of four million by 2000—1.3 million more than what actually occurred (TCMPC 1964). The Twin Cities pursued highway system expansion on this basis during the late 1960s and 1970s. As a result, the region’s transportation infrastructure was oversized, consuming fiscal resources that might have been allocated to other needs. By the time authorities in New South Wales and Minnesota became aware of the gap between their forecasts and reality, considerable public and private resources were committed and it was too late to redirect them.  An alternative approach to “predict and plan” is anticipatory governance or foresight (Boyd et al. 2015; Quay 2010). Rather than identifying and working in a linear fashion toward a predetermined end-state, anticipatory governance entails evaluating policies and investments in terms of their compatibility with the widest range of potential futures. An increasingly popular technique for assessing future risks and uncertainty is exploratory scenario planning (Quay 2010; Roberts 2014; Tewdwr-Jones and Goddard 2014; Wihbey 2016). Instead of envisioning the most desirable outcome, projecting forward on the basis of current trends, or forecasting the most probable scenario, exploratory scenario planning entails the construction of worst-case, unacceptable, and acceptable scenarios. New York City’s Panel on Climate Change, for example, devised multiple evidence-based scenarios premised on different levels and rates of change in air temperature, annual precipitation, sea                                             5 Indeed, the foundations of the 2006 Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe are the visioning by the 2002–03 Central Ontario Zone Smart Growth Panel and the population, housing, and employment forecasts in the 2005 Growth Outlook prepared by Hemson Consulting. Similar processes of spatially allocating forecast growth in line with a normative vision underlie regional plans in Vancouver, Calgary, and almost every other growing city. 15 level, and extreme hot and cold weather and precipitation events. These were then used to “stress test” social and infrastructure systems. Those that performed the least well under multiple scenarios are prioritized for investment. This logic could be taken further by incorporating change in other variables, including labour market participation, energy costs, housing costs, and so on. Similarly, the Great Lakes Futures Project employed scenario analysis to assess the long-term impacts of eight social, economic, and environmental drivers on the basin (Creed et al. 2016; Creed et al. 2015). Accommodating uncertainty means devising policy frameworks, institutions, physical environments, and infrastructure systems that can adapt, or continue to function, under a range of possible future conditions. For example, we might ask whether Ontario municipalities are facilitating the creation of new neighbourhoods, subdivisions, and settlement areas whose urban form and supporting infrastructure will perform well for their residents if energy costs dramatically increase, extreme weather events become more frequent, the economic base changes, or the population’s demographic profile shifts. In the workshop discussions, participants expressed concern that building adaptability and flexibility into policy would translate into more frequent policy changes, undermining investment certainty and driving up development costs. Policies and plans are quite sensibly subject to mandatory periodic reviews that provide opportunities to reassess policy objectives and instruments. Still, those with long-term financial investments in urban development have a strong interest in reducing their exposure to risk and uncertainty, including changes to the “rules of the game.” The approach to long-term urban planning and policymaking presented here is expected to increase, rather than decrease, policy stability by “pricing in” long-term risks and sources of uncertainty. A policy framework that accommodates a range of possible futures will require less amendment over time because it is designed to adapt to changing conditions.  Finally, policymaking through a resilience lens requires that planners recognize that complex interdependencies are a source of uncertainty and that addressing them may have unanticipated consequences or perverse impacts. Workshop participant Tom Smith advised that policymakers and planners should adopt Hippocrates’ dictum to “do no harm.” Summary Resilience is a popular buzzword in urban planning and policymaking, particularly in the fields of emergency management and climate change. Its meaning, however, is vague. We define resilience not as a desirable end-state, but as a governing strategy for risk management under considerable uncertainty. We distinguish between two types of risks: sudden shocks, including extreme weather events or economic recession, and slow shifts such as demographic change. These may be viewed as internal and external to the urban region. Local authorities are likely to have more influence on internal sources of risk. Much as in investment finance, the urban region should be viewed as portfolio of assets whose collective 16 redundancy and diversity contribute to its resilience. The goal of resilience-oriented policymaking should be to foster these characteristics at a variety of scales and across domains. The process of resilience-oriented policymaking is anticipatory governance: the use of exploratory scenario analysis to determine which policy interventions will produce an urban environment that will perform well under the maximum range of potential future conditions. This is distinct from conventional “predict and plan” approaches, which identify a singular desired future outcome and work toward creating it.    Whose resilience? Resilience for whom? The concept of resilience has been criticized on several grounds. Social theorists have noted that a basic condition of modern life is a “risk society,” one that simultaneously embraces and resists the risks associated with rapid change (Beck 1992; Giddens 2002). In this context, some see the emergence of resilience discourse as related to the contemporary atmosphere of heightened global economic, social, and political turbulence and environmental threats, as well as a political-ideological context favourable to limited government, devolution of authority, and individual and community self-reliance (Amin 2013; Beilin and Wilkinson 2015; Fainstein 2015; Shaw and Maythorne 2011; Welsh). In connection with the latter, there may be a political tendency to use resilience (in the sense of “bouncing back”) to defend a suboptimal or unjust status quo. Framing urban resilience as a product of social capital or the strength of social bonds may also serve as a cover for governments to “de-socialize” risks by privatizing or transferring welfare-state functions to individuals or households. Moreover, Jabareen (2015) notes that control over the identification and prioritization of risks, as well as the allocation of resources in response to them, is itself a source of power. For this reason, most emphasize inclusive and collaborative urban governance processes (Goldstein 2012).  Recognizing these criticisms, we propose that resilience is a potentially useful guide to policymaking insofar as it foregrounds underappreciated sources of uncertainty and the complex interconnections among social, economic, environmental, and fiscal variables.   17 2. The Toronto region: risks, vulnerabilities, and actions Mounting an anticipatory governance process for the Toronto region is beyond the scope of this project. We saw an opportunity, however, to contribute to public debate on the health and future of the region and, more specifically, to the Ontario government’s coordinated review of its Toronto-region land-use planning policies by conducting a holistic assessment of assets and vulnerabilities in relation to known risks. Toronto is correctly hailed as a high-performing region, yet over the past two decades local foundations, academic researchers, and others have independently catalogued a range of negative indicators and trends.  This section synthesizes some these disparate findings with discussions that emerged in four workshops held in February 2015 with financial support from the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs. Each workshop focused on a theme: the economy, society, the built and natural environments, and fiscal health. Twenty-eight professionals with experience in a broad range of issues were invited to participate (see Appendix). Many of the participants came from outside the traditional constituencies of land-use planning. In addition to planners, architects and urban designers, developer-builders, and environmentalists, the roster of participants also included practitioners and experts in social-service delivery, geriatric care, economic development, housing market and demographic forecasting, fiscal policy, and the design and finance of infrastructure projects. Workshop participants represented themselves, not their organizations or employers, and their remarks presented in this paper are their own.  Each was asked to consider three questions:   1. What risks, threats, and uncertainties do the Toronto region face over the medium and long terms?  2. What are the region’s principal assets and vulnerabilities that may improve or undermine its capacity to anticipate and respond to these challenges?  3. And what interventions are required to improve this capacity?  Taken together, the workshops elicited a wide range of often provocative opinions and arguments. They also revealed interesting, and sometimes surprising, connections and points of consensus. At the same time, the discussion illustrated what one anthropologist has called the Rashomon Effect, after the Japanese film in which different characters interpret the same events in different ways (Heider 1988). The housing developer, the economist, the social worker, the medical doctor, the environmentalist, and the public finance expert are all centrally concerned with urban development and its impacts, yet each understands it in different terms.   Much has occurred since the workshops were held. Most obviously, the 2015 federal election revealed a public appetite for broad-based infrastructure investment that 18 was not foreseen by workshop participants. Debates over the causes of and solutions to metropolitan housing affordability crises have intensified. And in the aftermath of the Paris Conference on Climate Change, federal-provincial relations now revolve around the linkage between climate change mitigation strategies and the future of Canada’s natural resource economy. We acknowledge these and other changes and events in the discussion.  Assets Toronto’s social sustainability and economic growth stem from a range of natural and human-made assets. As Juan Gomez put it, “in this region we … have the right fundamentals: education, transportation, infrastructure, openness to business, and the ability to expand and attract workers who can find housing.”  Location, natural endowments, and proximity to markets. Greater Toronto derives stability and security from its location and natural endowments. Located near the border with the United States means that Toronto is within one day’s drive or a short flight of approximately one-third of the North American population. Southern Ontario also benefits from being located far inland, yet with uninterrupted access to Atlantic sea routes via the St. Lawrence Seaway. This gives Toronto a climate-change advantage—about 13% of the world’s urban population lives in low-lying coastal areas vulnerable to rising sea levels. The inundation of coastal areas will displace tens of millions of people and disrupt economic production and trade (Satterthwaite et al. 2007). The Toronto region also benefits from direct access to abundant fresh water, of which the Great Lakes account for 20% of the world’s supply. Finally, although the growing season is shorter than in the American heartland, the food security of the Greater Golden Horseshoe, and Southern Ontario more generally, is supported by abundant productive farmland.  Agglomeration, growth, and economic diversity. In the workshop discussion, architect Martin Sparrow, whose career has been primarily in Alberta, favourably compared Toronto’s economic diversity to Calgary’s oil-driven boom-bust cycle. The Toronto region emerged in the early postwar period as Canada’s preeminent manufacturing and service-sector hub, supported by consistent investment in comprehensive infrastructure systems, including highway, bus, and subway networks, and lake-based water and sewer systems, as well as integrated industrial and business parks planning. This facilitated economic diversification—while the region has large automotive, pharmaceutical, and financial services sectors, it is not dependent on any one of them. By virtue of its sectoral diversity, Toronto evaded the postwar economic decline of the nearby “rustbelt” cities of the Upper Midwest and Northeastern states (King, Hracs, and Denstedt 2010: 1–4).    The Toronto region’s greatest assets may be its size and consistent growth. The population of the Greater Golden Horseshoe has increased by an average of one million 19 residents in each decade since 1950. The provincial government forecasts that this will continue, fuelled almost entirely by international immigration. By 2040, the Greater Golden Horseshoe is expected to have a population of 13.4 million, up from 7.8 million in 2000. About three-quarters of this growth is forecast to occur in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). This translates into national “heft.” The Greater Toronto Area (not including the outer ring of the Greater Golden Horseshoe) accounts for 20% of Canada’s GDP, and 45% of Ontario’s.    Population increase is an asset in and of itself because it grows the economic and fiscal pie: new residents are also new workers and taxpayers. Economists have shown that economic growth correlates with both sectoral diversity and the agglomeration of population and businesses—in essence, that growth begets growth (see Glaeser 2010; Krugman 1991; Wolfe 2014). As Matthias Sweet noted, “The single biggest asset that the Toronto Region has is a large labour pool. And this large labour pool gives us this capacity for people to find their optimal jobs and for employers to find their optimal labour.” In short, Toronto’s agglomeration enables it to be diverse and specialized at the same time—the very definition of a redundant and diverse portfolio of economic assets.   Political stability, tolerance, and diversity. Toronto’s growth has been sustained by its relative stability. Canada is recognized as possessing exceptional political stability and low crime rates even compared to other developed countries. (Indeed, Canadian cities’ high rankings in the Grosvenor Resilience Index and other business climate and quality-of-life indices stem in large part from domestic political stability, lack of corruption, and rule of law.)  Toronto’s stability and tolerance make it attractive to migrants and international investors. In fact, diverse international migration has driven the region’s economic agglomeration and diversification. A societal consensus in favour of large-scale immigration sets Canada apart from most other democratic countries. Indeed, Canada may be the only immigrant-receiving country without a mainstream anti-immigration political party. While accepting approximately 100,000 international migrants per year and becoming one of the most ethno-linguistically diverse cities in the world, the Toronto region has experienced little of the large-scale social and political conflict or civil unrest seen in other cities. Evidence is accumulating that Canadian urban housing markets—principally Vancouver’s but also Toronto’s—have become safe places for international investors to park capital at a time when returns are low and a weak Canadian dollar reduces costs to external buyers (Canada 2016; Duggan 2016; Ireland 2015).Toronto’s historical capacity to receive and integrate international migrants is facilitated by its existing diasporic communities. As Peter Thoma put it, “people looking for where to go in the world will start with their own personal networks, and those networks exist in Toronto.”  Some workshop participants proposed that Toronto may benefit from problems elsewhere in the world, including population displacement due to war, inter-group conflict, natural disaster, climate change, and economic and political uncertainty. Indeed, 20 the World Bank (2016) has made several dire forecasts: that water scarcity alone may reduce GDP in Africa, the Middle East, and East Asia by as much as 14% by 2050; rising prices for food and clean water will blunt global poverty reduction; and draught and natural disaster will spark resource-driven armed conflicts. Toby Lennox argued that Toronto should market its stability to global corporations who may be looking to shift production and supply chains to locations less susceptible to long-term risks, including political instability and climate change.  Relative prudence in a favourable fiscal environment. Collectively, Canadian governments have considerably more spending and borrowing capacity than they did 20 years ago, the latter enhanced by historically low interest rates. Total government spending nationwide decreased to 39% of GDP in 2014 from 53% in 1992. The total government debt-to-GDP ratio (again, all levels) declined from over 100% to about 66% in 2007 as the federal and many provincial governments brought their budgets into balance in the late 1990s and 2000s through a mix of expenditure reductions and tax increases (Crowley, Murphy, and Veldhuis 2012). Nationally, stimulus measures drove the total government debt-to-GDP ratio up to 86% in 2014. Despite this uptick, the debt burden is considerably less than in similar economies. Overall, the municipal fiscal balance sheet is healthy. Municipal governments are forbidden to run operating deficits, and collectively have plenty of room to borrow for capital projects (Bazel and Mintz 2014). The City of Toronto has voluntarily elected to cap its debt servicing costs well below the province’s limit of one-quarter of the operating budget. Canadian governments’ fiscal prudence relative to many other countries means that resources are available to pursue resilience-enhancing social, economic, and environmental policy objectives. External risks Macro-demographic risk: The ageing society. Last year was the first in which the total number of Canadian seniors exceeded people under the age of 15. The long-term decline in birth rates coupled with longer lifespans means that the average age of the population is increasing while labour market participation rates are declining (Ontario 2014: ch. 1). The Ontario government forecasts that, province-wide, the number of seniors will double in absolute terms by 2035. This will have a variety of interdependent effects.   A growing over-65 population will spur greater demand for senior-appropriate housing and neighbourhood environments. In the United States, seniors have eclipsed young people as the principal driver of household formation (Kolko 2015). With advancing age comes reduced mobility and increased incidence of disease and disability, all of which undermine the confidence and capacity to live independently (Frye 2014; WHO 2007). Neighbourhood-scale barriers to mobility, such as wheelchair-inaccessible pedestrian environments and buildings, pose a profound barrier to independent ageing in 21 place. Legislated requirements, including under the 2005 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, pertain to new construction, but the retrofitting of existing neighbourhoods is often impracticable.   The social isolation of older people will only grow in the coming decades. Samir Sinha noted that “we’re less likely now than 50 years ago to live in intergenerational households or even intergenerational communities. In fact, 23% of older Ontarians tell us that they don’t have anyone close by who can help them with a simple task if needed. That level of social isolation is a big concern.” As people continue to age in place in neighbourhoods that are single-use and car-dependent, the risks associated with social isolation will grow, including increased emergency response needs and health care costs.   A higher dependency ratio (the proportion of young and elderly dependents to income-earners) will put pressure on the tax base. More people on fixed incomes, a substantial proportion of which will be in the form of transfers from governments, translates into higher spending demands and less tax revenue. At the same time, the growing cohort of seniors will generate new demands for health and long-term care expenditures. Governments will also be expected to pay out pension and other benefits to a growing number of former employees. Demographically driven revenue constraints and cost pressures will occur in addition to demands for new spending on growth-related infrastructure and the maintenance and replacement of existing systems. In Greater Toronto, the trend toward an ageing society will be somewhat moderated by immigration, which brings working-age people and youth into the economy.   Environmental risk: Climate change. Changes to weather and air and water temperatures pose another category of risk. The increasing frequency of sudden shocks such as extreme weather events, as well as slow shifts such as increasing seasonal temperature variation, will impose direct and indirect costs on households and businesses, especially in cities (Hunt and Watkiss 2011). Floods as a result of high-volume precipitation will stress storm water management infrastructure and increase soil erosion, resulting in increased property damage. The Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that $US4.2 trillion of economic value would be at risk globally through the year 2100, should the average temperature rise by 4ºC (EIU 2015). Climate-change risks may be anticipated and mitigated, although their precise timing and severity of impact may not be predictable. Insurance companies are already pricing climate change risks into their models (Sundermann, Schelske, and Hausmann 2014; Team Green Analytics 2015).   By the 2040s, the average temperature in the Toronto region is expected to rise by 3.5 to 4ºC, increasing with distance from Lake Ontario (Theobald et al. 2011). The University of Hawaii’s Mora Lab projects that in the absence of global mitigation of carbon emissions, Toronto will reach “climate departure”—the year after which the average temperature will exceed the extreme high between 1860 and 2005—in 2047 (Mora 2013). The Toronto Environmental Office and Toronto Public Health forecast that 22 the number of days with extreme heat (over 30ºC) will triple and that the number of annual heat-related deaths could double by mid-century (City of Toronto 2014b). Analysis indicates that air temperatures are highest in high-density areas featuring more impermeable surfaces, which indicates the need to integrate heat mitigation into new and redeveloped built environments (Rinner and Hussain 2011). As temperatures rise, a greater proportion of precipitation will fall as rain rather than snow. There is likely to be considerably less snow in the winter, but precipitation will also be more concentrated, falling in short, high-volume bursts that will challenge existing stormwater infrastructure and run off rather than be absorbed into soil (Theobald et al. 2011).    Globally, fresh water is under stress due to climate change and urban development (UN Water 2014). The Great Lakes will not be immune to climate change effects. While cities on the ocean coasts experience sea-level rise, scientists forecast that in the Great Lakes, rising air and water temperatures will decrease water levels through evaporation, as well as lead to larger and more frequent algae blooms that undermine fish habitats and, potentially, water supplies (Gronewold et al. 2013; O'Reilly et al. 2015). Climate change will also affect the generation, distribution, and demand for energy. One analysis suggests that lower water levels could reduce Ontario’s hydroelectric output by 1,100 MW, at the same time that demand for cooling systems will increase (Clean Air Partnership 2011). Heat also reduces the efficiency of long-distance electricity transmission and distribution systems (Aivalioti 2015).    All in all, the localized impact of weather and temperature change on ground- and lakewater supply for urban and agricultural uses, invasive species, ecosystem function, energy supply, and lake-based shipping is uncertain (Gregg et al. 2012). The research suggests that the built environment and infrastructure systems lack the redundancy and diversity to absorb climate change effects.  Economic risk: Flagging innovation and investment attraction. Standing in the background are perennial sources of uncertainty: macroeconomic cycles, transformative technological innovations such as automation, change in the terms of trade, energy costs, volatile currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in access to capital. By virtue of strong linkages to continental and world markets, the local and national economies are not islands. Participants in the economy-themed workshop agreed that local residents, firms, and governments have always been, and always will be, to some degree subject to decisions, flows, and forces that are beyond their control.    Frank Clayton raised the spectre of the American Rustbelt to say that even long-term success can come to an end. After dominating global steel and automobile production for generations, the fortunes of many American cities quickly reversed when offshore producers produced more innovative products and undercut them on cost. The collapse of Nortel, which had a large footprint in the Toronto region, and the radical decline of Blackberry, are examples of champions being out-innovated and out-competed. Canadian 23 exporters know that the exchange rate drives their competitiveness. Canadian goods and services producers came to depend on a weak dollar in the mid-1980s and again in the late 1990s and early 2000s. When the exchange rate rapidly returned to par in 2011–12 for the first time since the mid-1970s, many businesses were virtually wiped out, especially in the manufacturing sector (Oschinski, Chan, and Kobrinsky 2014; Spiro 2013).  Ontario is a magnet for foreign direct investment by market share and dollar volume, topping California and Texas as the largest North American receiving jurisdiction for greenfield projects (FDI Intelligence 2015: 10). While the Conference Board (2012) and others view foreign direct investment as a driver of innovation, productivity, and income growth, FDI also renders local economies vulnerable to decisions by foreign firms whose material interests may lie elsewhere. There is however an unfortunate history of the Ontario and Canadian governments giving foreign branch plants loans and concessions in exchange for production and employment guarantees, only to have those firms use the threat of closure to bargain for more incentives once the agreements expire. Cluster-based economic development strategies may embed mobile capital in the local economy. One participant brought up the case of California-based semiconductor maker AMD, which acquired local graphics processor firm ATI Technologies in 2006. AMD has maintained the Canadian operation because of strong local linkages.  While southern Ontario has benefited from proximity to and integration with the American market in the past, it remains subject to external pressures and sources of uncertainty. The challenge is to ensure the resilience of the regional economy by fostering sectoral diversity and redundant capacities (Wolfe 2010). This points to nurturing a diverse portfolio of clusters that embed talent and investment as opposed to inducing standalone investments with subsidies that may be outbid by other jurisdictions. It also points to the need for investment in hard and soft infrastructures that support skills development and innovation, improve businesses’ access to capital, and lower the cost of mobility of people and goods.  Internal vulnerabilities Complacency. In The Resilience Dividend, Rodin (281) concludes that there is less urgency to act in stable times, so governments tend to reactively respond to crises instead of proactively anticipating the future. The governance challenge is therefore to “reduce reliance on crisis as a driver of policy change” (300). Matthias Sweet agreed that slow-burn problems often lose out to crises: “if a problem needs to be loud for it to be worth addressing, that’s problematic because some problems are going to be sexier and some are not.”    Participants in the fiscal- and economy-themed workshops agreed that decades of steady growth and abundant natural assets and locational advantages have bred complacency regarding the region’s social and economic problems. Richard Joy stated that 24 the Toronto region’s relative economic stability during the Great Recession and its legacy assets have “in some ways masked a lot of our larger challenges and allowed us to not face them.” Complacency also stems from the relative absence of crisis. Many of the region’s vulnerabilities have emerged gradually and many of the risks it faces are long-term and cumulative. It is easier to be complacent about slow shifts than sudden shocks.   Inadequate strategic regional coordination. One outcome of complacency is inadequate regional coordination. Several workshop participants decried the region’s disjointed local governance, seeing in today’s panoply of municipalities a situation analogous to that which existed before the creation of Metro Toronto in 1954. At that time, what is now the City of Toronto contained 13 municipalities within what was then York County; today, the GTAH contains 25 municipalities and the Greater Golden Horseshoe 110. Metro was created to centralize capital borrowing to modernize infrastructure, influence the urban development pa
