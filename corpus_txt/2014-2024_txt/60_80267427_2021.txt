thesis focuses on the multifaceted dimensions of sociality found in subsistence economic activities in the Lau Islands of Fiji. Primarily based on fieldwork conducted on the island of Cicia, I examine how land and sea resources are socially manifested in the everyday lives of coastal indigenous iTaukei Fijians. With just a weekly flight and monthly ferry delivering supplies to Cicia from the main island of Viti Levu, subsistence resources are the most critical components to the day-to-day dietary of village communities on the island. Yet, subsistence resources are not just of nutritional value to villagers. The ecological foundation of subsistence economics also underpins extensive sets of knowledge practices, social relationships, and the human-environmental encompassment of the archipelago of Lau. By accounting for social values of sea and land, the thesis shows how ecology is a material foundation to human capabilities like creativity and resilience. Furthermore, by viewing ecology and people’s lives as inseparably connected by history and practice, I demonstrate how temporalities of environmental, social, economic, and political relations of multidimensional scales take root within local realities in places like Cicia. As I argue, the socio-ecological foundation of rural villages in Fiji provides forms of leverage, not simply to resist political and economic forces, but also to envision social change by contesting conditions of monetary dependency inflicted by capitalism. Contextualized by the economic implications instigated by the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, I also discuss the historical resilience of subsistence, village-based economics to not only endure different crises, but creatively demonstrating its radical potential for societal reconfigurations. In order to do so, I have throughout the thesis adopted an Hocartian approach that accounts for the interisland relationships of Lau that are integral to the sociality of subsistence economics on Cicia.        iv                             v  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ________________________________________________________   My interest and appreciation of island societies in the Pacific grew exceptionally through my ten months as an exchange student in Fiji at the University of the South Pacific (USP) in 2018. While taking courses at USP in political science and Pacific studies, I was exposed to some powerful approaches that lecturers and fellow students applied to view historic and contemporary trajectories of world events from their Pacific perspectives. Experiences like these inspired me to return to the Pacific for fieldwork after being enrolled into the master’s program of social anthropology at the University of Bergen (UiB) in 2019. Over the past two years, I designed my own research project, conducted fieldwork in Fiji, analyzed materials and literature, and completed the writing of this thesis. However, this accomplishment would never have been achieved without the help and support from the people who directly or indirectly assisted me throughout this journey. First, let me begin by thanking the people of Cicia. The generosity of providing me the opportunity to spend time together in your everyday tasks and activities is what made the writing of this thesis possible. I am particularly grateful for the people of Mabula village who allowed me to stay in their community while conducting fieldwork. Hopefully, we can meet again soon. Vinaka vakalevu. I also want to thank my academic advisor Professor Edvard Hviding. Your encouraging guidance and constructive comments have been both immensely productive and inspiring. The continual supervision, in a turbulent year of pandemic-related implications that severely affected circumstances of fieldwork and the semesters of writing, has been greatly appreciated. Furthermore, I must express my thankfulness for the great assistance of Susana Vulawalu, who, as my fieldwork companion for the first three weeks in Mabula, helped me initiate my research on Cicia. Moreover, by continuing our dialogue after I left Fiji early due to the pandemic, you directly supported me throughout the entire writing process by offering fruitful contributions, feedback, and words of encouragement. For all this and more, I owe you a great deal of personal and academic gratitude. A special thanks also goes to my co-supervisor Dr. Stuart Kininmonth, who assisted with networking and the facilitation of my fieldwork through USP in Suva, Fiji. Most importantly, in addition to inspiring conversations about marine science, you introduced me to Susana who turned to have the immeasurable value to the research and writing process of this thesis. vi  Furthermore, I would like to thank the other members from the Department of Social Anthropology at UiB, who throughout this writing process shared different ideas, perspectives, and suggestions. Thanks to Nora Haukali for sharing many helpful advice through your own experience of conducting fieldwork in Fiji. Also, thanks to Miriam Ladstein for helping with various practicalities related to the preparation of fieldwork. To all my other friends and fellow students from UiB and USP; thank you for the inspiring conversations and discussions, and a special thanks to those of you who provided me with feedback on early drafts of this thesis at seminars. Moreover, thanks to my sister Cecilie Larsen and my good friend Erik Nordnes Einum for taking the time to help me with proofreading. I also want to thank the interdisciplinary Island Lives, Ocean States research project for funding parts of my fieldwork in Fiji. And last, but by no means least, I would not have been able to write this thesis had it not been for the enormous support and encouragement received from my closest family; my mom, dad, sister, brother and our two border collies. Thank you all.  Håkon Larsen Arendal, July 2021   vii  PROLOG ________________________________________________________   Soaring above the deep-blue waters of the Koro Sea, after departing on the weekly Twin Otter flight from Nausori Airport on Fiji’s main island Viti Levu, I anxiously watched the passing islands below from my window, wondering how the next months would unravel. Two rows in front, Susana would turn her head around to share an expression of excitement before she refocused out on the ocean, contoured by turquoise coral reef lagoons surrounding different islands. After little less than an hour of flight time, we spotted Cicia in the distance through the cockpit windows in front, that was not obstructed by any door to separate the aircraft cabin. On our approach, the pilots took a wide turn, circling clockwise over the island with passenger windows tilted down towards its green but also dry-patched valleys and forest interior landscape. As we rounded the south-eastern bend of Cicia, Mabula village soon came into sight alongside the south end of the coast (figure 1). The nerves were tense as I distantly observed the village where I would be stationed over the coming time. The propeller airplane descended and touched down softly onto the cut out stretch of grass runway among the tightly packed coastline of coconut palms. Susana and I disembarked as the aircraft came to a halt and opened its doors to us and the seven other passengers. As there is just one weekly flight operating between Viti Levu and Cicia, many people often gather around the small airport to receive returning family members and to send or collect airmail. As we walked out of the plane “Pālagi1, pālagi” had been spreading by young kids standing behind the boundary fence on the parking lot side, we were later informed. Unaware of whom to approach, I followed Susana’s lead after collecting our bags, out to a white and dusty Toyota pickup truck where her cousin Epeli awaited us to help load the luggage onto the cargo bed. Next to the parking lot, a wide poster erected onto a pair of rounded steel pillars read out “Welcome to the Organic Island of Cicia.” In the bottom right corner, signed by local, regional, and international contributing organizations, one could further read the pledge of Cicia to guarantee an island where its “products are grown under the principles of health, ecology, fairness, care, culture and traditions.” Having stowed our bags, we took a seat in the back of the  1 Translates to “foreigner” and is often used to describe people with European appearance. The word pālagi is found within the Samoan and Tongan languages, while vulagi/kaivalagi has similar meaning in Fijian. The usage of pālagi over vulagi in this instance either reflect the historic and linguistic traces of Tongan pre-colonial influence on Cicia or simply the contemporary influence by the cosmopolitan capital of Suva in Fiji. viii  truck and Epeli drove us off towards Mabula. As we reached the village, we pulled up in front of Susana’s grandparents’ house where we were greeted and requested to enter the side entrance to sit down on the handwoven pandanus floormat to eat a freshly cooked meal of lairo (Fijian land crab) served whole with a side of taro and fish boiled in coconut milk. While chewing a mouthful of crab meat, I nodded in confirmation when Susana’s grandmother Vilisi asked whether I found the food to be of good taste. Vilisi followingly replied “vinaka” (thank you) and subsequently stressed its tastefulness by voicing “it’s organic!”   Figure 1 Cicia Island from the sky, with the many of houses of Mabula village visible close to the center-right of the picture.

With expectations to stay four months to conduct ethnographic fieldwork on Cicia, I had no idea how drastically these plans would change following the coronavirus pandemic of 2020. After only five weeks of staying in Mabula, the pandemic would not just force me to leave Cicia early. More fundamentally to the research project, the circumstances required epistemological and methodological improvisations that deviates from how conventional anthropological fieldwork is typically ix  defined by its approach of long-term participant observation. Although my weeks in Fiji were intense and valuable in terms of data collection, the resulting alterations would challenge me to incorporate secondary literature of nearby islands with an extensive historical scope. This would become a crucial model to analyze questions of research by forming an historical perspective to my own empirical materials. By this epistemological resolution, the thesis presents an anthropological analysis with a comparative scope that tries to methodologically combine associative features of time and space. While I first perceived this to be a necessary remedy to a disrupted fieldwork during extraordinary circumstances, I believe the outcome demonstrates how literature from the past can be reengaged in the present to analyze new inquiries of research.                     x                    xi  MAP OF FIJI ________________________________________________________    Figure 2 Map of Fiji, where the island of Cicia and Mabula village are marked by the red rectangle, northwest of the Lakeba Passage in the Lau Group (www.ontheworldmap.com), edited by author.            xii   1  CHAPTER ONE ________________________________________________________  INTRODUCTION   INTRODUCTION This thesis is an ethnographic account which aims to demonstrate the significance of subsistence economics among coastal indigenous iTaukei Fijians. Primarily based on fieldwork conducted on the volcanic and ‘organically certified’ island of Cicia in Mabula village, located in the Lau Archipelago in the eastern division of Fiji, the study sets out to examine the unique value of sea and land resources by exploring the broader sociocultural significance that these ecological foundations manifest in people’s everyday lives. My initial aim of the fieldwork was to research the importance of fishing practices to rural villagers, contextualized by ecological alterations to coral reefs that are caused by unfolding effects of global climate change. Yet, from the moment one arrives at Cicia and begins conversing with its people, one cannot evade asking the impending question which today permeates much of everyday village life; why is an island in Fiji ‘organic’? Declared an ‘organic island’ in 2013 by the Fijian government, following an authorization on banning chemical fertilizers and pesticides in local farm practices, Cicia became the first of its kind in the South Pacific to ever be certified as such. In collaboration with a wide array of development actors, the goal was to increase commercial activities by encouraging the exportation of local farm produce. However, with the habitual perception of Fijians to view sea and land binaries as unsolidified, there is a widespread prevalence among people of Cicia to apply the word organic in a multitude of innovative and socially significant ways, culturally underpinned by an ontology that integrates everyday activities, human-environmental relations, and history. While the organic serendipity would prove to persuasively capture a substantial amount of my research attention, practices related to subsistence fishing remain central.2 I did, however, find it as an empirical necessity to expand my scope of inquiry to include a broader template of everyday life on Cicia, where interconnected features of fishing and other village practices are methodologically integrated. As my research agenda immediately got changed, so was the  2 See Howell (2017) on the importance of serendipity to the anthropological discipline to make accidental and surprising ethnographic discoveries during fieldwork. 2  situational circumstances of the fieldwork itself. Consequences of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 created not only problems for sustained participant observation – where physical presence with interlocutors is valued as key – it also altered the concentration of research questions. In the Pacific Islands, climate change remains an essential component to any contextualizing basis of researching the contemporary importance of subsistence economic resources. With the anticipated effects of global warming on rising sea levels and increased sea-surface temperatures, in addition to ocean acidification and changes in storm patterns, food sources of coral reefs are increasingly threatened in places like the tropical Pacific (see Barnett and Campbell 2010). Nevertheless, urgencies catalyzed by the pandemic, and subsequent consequences of social lockdowns, fundamentally shifted the nature of fieldwork and my access to data. With the unreliable future of air travel and recommendations to return home from the University of Bergen, the pandemic forced me to repatriate to Norway in late March of 2020, approximately three months ahead of what my initial plans were. I was, however, disinclined to conclude that the pandemic ended my fieldwork. Instead, I decided to prolong my engagement with interlocutors through digital media and began following grassroot responses to the pandemic in Fiji, being attentive to the significant role of subsistence resources in mitigating economic tensions instigated by the global crisis. Although climate change is therefore less central (while remaining implicitly imperative) to this thesis, I firmly believe that discussing relations between people and ecology during a pandemic is both beneficial to understanding both the resilience of local communities and to highlight the urgency of potential climate change implications. The main empirical data for the account and analysis that follow remains grounded in the time spent in the village of Mabula. Fortunately, having arrived in early January, I completed eleven weeks of research in Fiji, five of which were conducted on Cicia. The other weeks were predominantly spent in the capital of Suva, where upon my arrival to Fiji I networked through the University of the South Pacific (USP), met with NGO conservationists, and interacted with numerous people from different walks of life – in particular at the municipal fish market in downtown Suva. Additionally, by supplementing my ethnography with comparative sources from eastern Fiji, I integrate an historical perspective of change and continuity to comprehend dynamics of interisland sociality and subsistence economics in the island group of Lau. By examining contingent features of ecology, kinship, cosmology, politics, and history, the thesis aims to uncover how creativity and resilience are founded in the everyday forms of subsistence economic practices. Moreover, the thesis seeks to explain how these capacities are manifested 3  by cultural displays of sociality and knowledge through connective dimensions to the material and immaterial encapsulation of the Lau Archipelago. Throughout the thesis, I will argue that an inter-relational solidarity is observable in the island group which is not simply founded on abstract ideas of equality and sameness, but by deep-rooted social practices and commitments of reciprocity, in addition to an unequal distribution of different resources.   METHODOLOGY AND ETHICS INITIATION OF FIELDWORK Before arriving at Cicia, the initial weeks in Fiji involved obtaining access to a village where I could conduct my research. One key element of my planned fieldwork was to live together with coastal Fijians on a day-to-day basis, using the methodology of participant observation to grasp a wider comprehension of socially significant aspects of fishing. To do so, I began networking with professors and students at the University of the South Pacific (USP) to find a suitable location. After a few weeks, my co-supervisior Dr. Stuart Kininmonth aquainted me with Susana Vulawalu, a marine science postgraduate student with relatives living in different parts of Fiji who also looked for a place to conduct her own research project. Stuart advised that it would be advantageous if we travelled to the same site, as it would help in facilitating my research as an outsider, in addition to giving both our individual project an interdicipliary element. I would provide Susana with insights from the methodological approcaches of social anthropology, while she complemented my information with observations from a marine science perspective on fish biomass and coral reef systems. Together we agreed on Cicia as our field site, where Susana arranged a place for us to stay in Mabula through relatives of her father who was himself from the village. We did consider other places where Susana had other relatives, such as Kadavu in southern Fiji and Vanua Balavu located northeast of Cicia. Cicia was favored because we considered the island to be more manageable for our research purposes as it is smaller in geographical and demographic scales and thus, we supposed, easier to form a comprehensive understanding holistically from. Additionally, with just one weekly flight and a monthly ferry operating between Cicia and the capital of Suva on Viti Levu, Stuart and Susana suggested that it would be easier to build rapport with people there, as they were less inclined to travel to Suva often, in contrast to places like Kadavu where ferries are operating more frequently. 4  When conducting fieldwork and doing participant observation as an outsider, gatekeepers are integral components to be granted admission to field sites and interlocutors. A gatekeeper, Zahle (2017:474) notes, is an individual who possesses a certain “control over the access to the organization or group” that the researcher wants to study. In other words, gatekeepers can facilitate passage for outside researchers to study localities that otherwise would not be easily accessible. Susana would conduct a shorter fieldwork for just three weeks before returning to Suva. Meanwhile, she fulfilled the gatekeeping role for the initiation phase of my fieldwork by assisting the building of rapport with interlocutors. First and foremost, Susana arranged the host family for us through her grandparents Vilisi and Noa who took great care of me also after Susana left Cicia. Although my host family arranged a different house further into the village mainly reserved for visiting relatives, where I could better store my belongings, I spent most hours with them and their closest kinfolks. This granted me the chance to partake in a variety of everyday activities and conversations, in addition to being introduced to many others of different occupations of all genders and age groups who became central interlocutors. Secondly, Susana helped diminishing the linguistic barrier of my inability to speak the Fijian language. While nearly all people of Fiji do speak English, since it is a former colony that remained under British rule until gaining independence in 1970, most daily conversations in the village were in Fijian. Susana assisted with translations when needed and explained situations, customs and so forth when I was unable to comprehend topics of discussion. Working close with a native speaker does, however, form some hindrances to establishing rapport with interlocutors. This fieldwork dynamic has been thoroughly explored in earlier work, most notably perhaps by Berreman (1962) who found that his informants in a Himalayan village would act differently according to the identity of his translator. In my case, I experienced that after my Susana left, people began speaking more directly to me. Early on some confessed shyness of speaking English, despite being proficient speakers, and preferred speaking Fijian through Susana’s translations. Although Susana’s presence provided me with pathways to central insights and findings, her departure enabled me to familiarize myself more in-depth with interlocutors. To be granted access to conduct research in a Fijian village, neither formal research permits (which I obtained by enrolling myself as an international student through USP) nor a gatekeeper are sufficient alone. Fijian villages are sites which involve specific, local protocols for engagement. A customary sevusevu was performed by having me present a bundle of dried yaqona (Piper methysticum) roots, known as kava, to the village chief in requesting permission 5  to stay in the village. Furthermore, as a family was arranged to host me, a second sevusevu was presented to their mataqali (clan), in addition to other gifts of household items to my host family specifically, as they became the tatau (primary caretakers) throughout my stay.   METHODOLOGICAL CHALLENGES The weeks spent on Cicia were surprisingly productive in terms of data collection, much resulting from the fact that Susana eased the process of networking with both women and men, in addition to making me aware of subtleties that would otherwise be difficult to capture as an outsider with limited experience in the field. Having read my research proposal, Susana had a general idea of my fieldwork interests, and it is more than fair to say that without her assistance the empirical materials of this thesis would have been significantly poorer, considering the shortened length of my stay in Mabula due to the pandemic. However, while the collection of data was for the most part productive, there were some methodological obstacles to the fieldwork which I encountered. In discussing fieldwork safety, Schwandner-Sivers (2009) explains how she negotiated her role as a researcher in Albania and Kosovo to find ‘safe spaces’ that ensured her protection in the field. During my fieldwork, I encountered a somewhat different dilemma regarding fieldwork safety and safe spaces. Rather than negotiating my role as a researcher to secure a safe space to work from, I had to negotiate my role in a secured safe space predefined by interlocutors. One central expectation I had for my fieldwork was to accompany people when and where they went fishing. By participating with interlocutors, we entangle ourselves in their lives with the aim to reach a certain level of immersion by the engaged exercises of practical knowledge within the given community (Zahle 2012:51-59). In doing so, by being shown aspects of society alongside people themselves, anthropologists do not aim to understand the world through a biological prism of the organic nature “as it really is”, but to discover the “diverse ways in which constituents of the natural world figure in the imagined, or so-called ‘cognised’ worlds of cultural subjects” (Ingold 2000:14, 21-22). This was not a straightforward process in practice. People wanted to ensure that I would not be harmed while conducting research by applying various protective measures. Some of these measures were not restrictively related to fishing but also concerned my general health condition, suggesting for instance to send me to the local health station if I informed them that I experienced a minor headache. These concerns sometimes snowballed into larger issues of 6  discussion, such as questioning my capacity to withstand heat from the sun. This subsequently shifted into the participative fieldwork domain of fishing, as I would be exposed to direct sunlight for several hours. I negotiated past this by reassuring people that I applied enough sunscreen and used UV-protective clothing when fishing. Convincing people of my capacity as a relatively proficient swimmer was a larger struggle. To some extent, this was rooted in more legitimate concerns of risks as ocean currents at different fishing spots could become very strong and – if not carefully watched – potentially dangerous. Interlocutors insisted that I began swimming and fishing with them on the inside of reefs where currents would be calmer. This led me to question my participative role in subsistence fishing practices; was my presence a burden? To a certain extent, it undoubtedly was. Firstly, people kept eyes on me to make sure that I was not struggling in the water. Secondly, my presence could have prevented them from going to more preferable locations where currents are stronger but where fishing is better. In this manner, interlocutors would select spaces for me to safely participate in, away from where they otherwise would prefer to fish. I therefore had to prove my capacities as a competent swimmer to gain trust, making myself useful in the water by helping with gear and holding catch. In anthropological discussions regarding the importance of trust, it is often referred to the trustfulness the anthropologist seeks to make interlocutors comfortable sharing personal insights, thoughts, and stories. In this situation, I had to build trust by convincing fishermen that I was capable enough to join them in deeper waters. As my fieldwork in Cicia was disrupted by the pandemic, I cannot claim to have fulfilled such an accomplishment of trust. However, by undertaking an apprenticeship role of fishing under the guidance of a host uncle, I took important steps to prove my capabilities. Starting out by learning how to spearfish off the beach, I was later able to join fishermen in stronger currents deeper out on the ocean.  SHIFTING METHODOLOGICAL CIRCUMSTANCES After making research progress on Cicia, the fieldwork circumstances drastically shifted as the coronavirus pandemic forced my early repatriation to Norway. Yet, I remained reluctant to define the pandemic as the endpoint of my fieldwork. Although most interlocutors from Cicia did not have internet connectivity, some of them did, and from Norway I managed to stay somewhat updated on others through those few with access to Facebook and WhatsApp. Through these media I conducted informal interviews and followed how people experienced 7  the coronavirus pandemic in Fiji. What relevance this would have regarding my research focus on subsistence economic practices was not apparent at first. This quickly changed in late April upon discovering a massive grassroots initiative on Facebook, with the establishment of an exchange group called Barter for Better Fiji (BBF). Responding to the economic recession people across Fiji began experiencing, with thousands of people losing their sources of income due to the disintegration of the formal labor market, resulting primarily from the near total collapse of the country’s tourism industry, BBF facilitated non-monetary forms of exchange that enabled subsistence produce to be frequently traded for typically cash-related items and services. Having been granted permission from BBF’s administration to conduct digital fieldwork by observing group activities, in addition to contacting group participants, I began noticing several dynamics which resembled observational data from my stay in Mabula as well as historical literature from Lau, that highlighted similar key roles and potentials of subsistence economics. In this manner, digital media provided me with an opportunity to continue some research despite of my physical departure from Fiji. However, as Miller et al. (2016) argues, to fully understand the phenomena of social media, we must also account for the dynamic and underlying sociocultural conditions of digital expressions. Technologies and digital platforms are not necessarily causative, but rather a new scaling of sociality where the visual of digitality becomes a new form of cultural and social communication (Miller et al. 2016:6-7). In other words, we still face the pressing concern of accounting for underlying societal elements that are being expressed through these media. The local economic responses in Fiji to the pandemic had been more difficult to comprehend without my on-ground observational information from Cicia and Suva. I could therefore conduct digital fieldwork, but mainly because I already was exposed to similar analogous phenomena. Hence, despite the value of digital anthropology in a time of restrictive travel and physical engagements, the central importance of non-digital ethnographic fieldwork remained imperative to this thesis.  ETHICS AND DATA COLLECTION Throughout my fieldwork, the main methodology to register ethnographic information was primarily done by taking handwritten notes during and after different engagements with interlocutors. As much of my participative objective was to join interlocutors in their daily practices (like fishing) much needed to be written afterwards for obvious practical reasons. I only used a tape recorder once for one semi-structured interview in Mabula. Days after taking 8  fieldnotes, I would often revise and reflect on my initial writing. I found this way of working insightful, as it provided reflective distance to my preliminary perceptions of different events and conversations that unfolded, which I could further expand on by elaborative writing. A great deal of the information obtained was gathered late at night, drinking kava with interlocutors from Mabula during what many people in the Pacific refer to as talanoa. Talanoa has been described as “a respectful, reciprocating interaction” where “one listens to the other” (Vaioleti 2006:26). Conversations of talanoa are informal in character but provides a social space where various issues can be raised, listened to, and discussed. Instead of approaching conversations as an extraction of information, talanoa facilitates the sharing of insights, histories, and hypothesis, often by ways of storytelling (Vaioleti 2006:22). As Vaioleti argues, talanoa “places the power to define what the Pacific issues are within the encounter between the researcher and the participant” (2006:26). Instead of excavating information from interlocutors, I found this way of conducting research not only ethically compelling, but also very productive as people seemed comfortable and motivated by being given the opportunity to share insights on their own premises. I initially had some concerns that my constant presence in the field by residing in Mabula would lead to an obscuring of the research conducted and complicate the preservation of interlocutors’ consent to collect information. However, to my surprise interlocutors would themselves often eagerly remind me to note things down or for example raise helpful questions to make seemingly irrelevant topics of conversation applicable to my research. Others would readily suggest places I should go and spontaneously introduce me to people they believed I should meet. Admittedly, in my state of confusion as an outsider working to adapt to a new lifestyle in the rural village of Mabula, some interlocutors seemed at times to have a greater understanding of my own research than I did myself. Although the identity of Susana Vulawalu as my fieldwork companion and gatekeeper is consensually disclosed, I have throughout the thesis used different measures of anonymization by applying pseudonyms to interlocutors, in addition to mixing some events and people where I considered it appropriate and necessary to protect the privacy of people. In this process, I have worked to ensure that empirical mixtures do not lead to alternate conclusions nor ethnographic inaccuracies. This is, however, more complicated in presenting ethnography from digital fieldwork. While BBF has accumulated an enormous base of members that will be discussed in detail in chapter five, people can easily be recognized through Facebook’s search engine if certain specific information is identified. In attempting to resolve this dilemma, I slightly altered 9  and merged empirical details by constructing “composite” figures from my virtual observational data (see Hopkins 1996 [1993]). Yet, I remained uncertain in knowing whether the confidentiality of privacy and information was adequately secured or not. Thus, I have decided to not present my digital materials by referring to any group members specifically – even as composite figures – but instead, discussing the larger significances of BBF by focusing on the broader social dynamics manifested by group activities in general. There will always be some restrictions to how well anonymization can be practically done in small island communities like Cicia, without producing an overtly generic account by removing all forms of contextual clues within the ethnography. Thus, while pseudonyms are carefully applied, there is one exception besides Susana Vulawalu where I do disclose the full name of one interlocutor, whose name is Susana Yalikanacea. Not only is Susana central to important ethnographic revelations in this thesis, but she is also a publicly outspoken figure who regularly interacts with journalists who request her to comment on different occurrences on the island. Applying a pseudonym for anonymization would be insufficient as an internet search of the ethnographical data would quickly reveal her identity on Fijian news sites. If I were to apply other measures to make her identity unrecognizable, it would entail procedures to drastically alter the empirical material itself and thus generate what I would consider severe ethnographic misrepresentations. In dialogue with Susana, to ensure that this decision is conducted in an ethically considerate way, none of the accounts involving her are substantially different to what she has or could have spoken about publicly in media.  AN HOCARTIAN APPROACH While the physical fieldwork on Cicia did dispense several case studies to investigate for this thesis, in addition to digital research, the shortened duration of actual fieldwork still left me with unexamined questions. To compensate for empirical gaps, I incorporate historic comparative ethnography from Lau to elaborate on central topics of research.  There are particularly three sources of different time periods which are frequently raised as supplementary materials to build a narrative of interisland sociality in Lau. Having worked as a schoolmaster on the island of Lakeba in the early 1910s, Arthur M. Hocart authored extensive ethnographic accounts from research conducted on many different islands of Lau, including Cicia (see Hocart 1929). The island group of Lau makes up a chain of around sixty islands (thirteen of which 10  today are inhabited by around 9,500 people in total3) of different sizes and typologies stretching nearly 225 nautical miles from north to south. With past fieldwork experience from the Solomon Islands, studying islanders there who found themselves in an acute period of transcending into a colonial socio-political lifeworld, Hocart operated a broad regional perspective to document cultural diversification in Fiji (see Hviding and Berg 2014). His comparative ethnography represented numerous perspectives from various islands, which fostered a reluctance to generalize by making space for interisland specificity and distinction in his writing (Hviding 2014:94). To advance the comparative perspective historically, I have interpreted the (often hyper-empirical) literature of Hocart while simultaneously immersing myself with ethnography from Moala (located west of Lau) written by Marshall Sahlins (1962) and in the joint work of Bayliss-Smith et al. (1988) concerning a broader perspective on interisland relations in eastern Fiji. While the field study by Sahlins covers a period two generations after the work of Hocart, the work of Bayliss-Smith et al. is contextualized by the post-colonial experience in Fiji, following the country’s independence in 1970. The studies by Sahlins and Bayliss-Smith et al. were, similarly to Hocart, preoccupied with questions regarding regional similarities and differences in forming an interisland sociality. By considering associative features of custom, ecology, polity, particularly magnified by kinship practices, the studies elucidate the historic centrality of subsistence economic resources to the social formation of the Lau Archipelago. Hocart was in many ways ahead of his time in terms of his ethnographical contributions, overshadowed by those conventionally perceived as the foundational pillars of the modern anthropological discipline and its methodology, such as Bronislaw Malinowski. Engaged with an observational methodology to study intersubjective processes and social interactions, Hocart’s approach resembles dimensions of what much later established itself as postmodernism (Hviding 2014:83-84). Primarily situated on Lakeba, the center of the old Lakeban chiefdom which today remain the paramount chiefly island of Lau, Hocart found himself amid a group of people highly reflective of their past in attempt to socially position themselves within a colonial lifeworld. While diffusionism dominated anthropological theories at the time, Hocart (1929) seemed to be much more of a relationist, consistently attentive to social positions and the divinity of power. For instance, Sahlins argued how Hocart’s proposition demonstrated the generative encompassment of rituals and beliefs to establish  3 See Fiji Bureau of Statistics (2018) for the most recent census of Fiji. 11  relations of authority, having the “cosmic systems of governmentality” engaged in societies long before the classic state formation was instituted in Fiji (Sahlins 2017:24). By extensive documentations, Hocart illustrated how the sociality of Lauan islands were not formed as isolated cultural entities, but rather generated through the continual engagements of people, places, cosmologies, and resources found both nearby and far away. That is not to say that the Lauan sociality has been unaffected by external forces throughout history. Perhaps most notably, it is explained that the frequency of interisland contacts among people was severely reduced following the conquest of eastern Fiji by the Tongan prince Enele Ma`afu in the mid-1800s (see Spurway 2015). By instituting a scheme of taxation, Ma`afu ruled communities to transfigure the local modes of production to prioritize copra and in doing so shifting attention away from the resource diversification of islands and regional specialization, which had been some of the main driving components to interisland exchange (Sahlins 1962:36-37, 420). Following the British annexation of 1874, colonialism further exacerbated interisland fractures by means of economic reorientation as the British redirected and centralized trade routes westwards to the old capital of Levuka (and later Suva) in order to facilitate copra exportation to Europe (Bayliss-Smith et al. 1988:141). Paradoxically, as settlements previously located inland were moved closer to the coast – easing copra trade for the emerging colonial economy – mobility beyond these coastlines became increasingly constrained. That said, despite strains and impairments, interisland sociality does remain important to the everyday life of Lauan people. Today there are five villages in total on Cicia, populated by roughly one thousand people. Spread around the entire coast, the villages are connected by one gravel road stretching around the shoreline, except for the northernmost part of the island where the road winds up through the interior valleys, connecting the villages of Tarakua and Lomaji. As visualized by the picture from the opening vignette (figure 1), neighboring islands of Lau are situated close enough that they are observable also on the ground. Mabula is the chiefly village of Cicia, meaning they decide who will be installed as the leading chief of the island. It is, however, not uncommon that the chief of Cicia resides in a different village, if he is related to the noble mataqali of Mabula who hold the island’s high chief position (Tui Cicia). Although my research primarily is based on fieldwork from Cicia, in particular Mabula village, following the Hocartian approach, no village nor island in Lau is to be understood in isolation. Neglecting the relevance of intervillage and interisland relations would essentialize and obscure how diverse forms of activities are manifested in people’s everyday lives. Most interisland mobility is now 12  configured towards the urban center of Suva by the ferry and airplane schedules. Still, as chapters of this thesis will demonstrate, the historic relevance of outward mobility at sea persists in various cultural forms, linking people of Lau through social features of kinship and subsistence economics. The integrative role of the ocean should not be understated. By contemporary practices, the sea enables a connective space for the “fluid foundation to sociality” where people and their relations are formed by a multi-local reality that maritime travel both generates and maintains (Hviding 2015:138). As illustrated by the famous “sea of islands” concept of Hau’ofa (1993), the islands of Oceania were not separated by the sea, but rather interconnected by cultural engagements of maritime travel. While this view is usually applied to the Pacific lifeworld at large, as Hviding argues with regards to the New Georgia group, seas of islands are also found in more spatially concentrated areas where social and economic lives were nevertheless lived in ways that were “truly archipelagic” (Hviding 2015:124). Similarly, the Lau Archipelago is a sea of islands on its own within the larger cultural encompassment of Oceania. There is “no confined locality” to observe, as geographical diversity necessitated interactive mobility across the sea by practices of marriage, exchange, warfare, and so forth (Hviding 2014:88). Thus, places like Mabula are better conceptualized as multifaceted nodes of interconnections. Methodologically, the village then becomes a site “to reside and a point from which the anthropologist moves out along the lines of social relations” (Kapferer 2000:28). By presenting a multi-local perspective, this thesis covers ways in which places like Mabula have been – and still are – entangled materially and immaterially by the complex movements of people, beliefs, and resources.  THEMATIC FOCUS AND ARGUMENT In 2018, the nonprofit environmental organization Conservation International laid out an arrangement of plans under the Lau Seascape Strategy, to conserve the terrestrial and marine biodiversity of Lau (Conservation International 2018). With goals of sustainable development, the initiative has set targets for the year of 2030 to increase climate change resilience by bolstering food security in the region. Although the strategy has a clear predisposition by its conservation driven interest in the biological features of the island group, the seascape conception is greatly suitable to the holistic worldview of people in places like Cicia. The Lau seascape can be viewed not simply as a composition of biological ecosystems, but a 13  sociocultural amalgamation that interconnects the environment with the habitus of people’s everyday practices. In doing so, it illustratively breaks with the nature/culture dichotomy that handles environmental issues as separated from social issues which, in the words of Rudiak-Gould; “divorces humans from the world in which they live” (Rudiak-Gould 2016:263). Seeing ecology and people’s lives as inseparably connected, enables us to form an understanding to how temporalities of environmental, social, economic, and political relations of multidimensional scales take root within local realities and practices in places like Cicia. My argument is that the village-based subsistence economy is a social domain which comprises much more than nutritional features. Subsistence practices are not narrowly concerted to the human necessity for material survival, but more broadly to a cultural endurance by repetition of central activities in which nutritional resources play part in the “long conversation” of everyday life (see Bloch 1977). Moreover, ecological resources are on Cicia underpinned by extensive sets of knowledge practices, social relations, and the human-environmental encompassment of the Lau seascape. By accounting for social values of sea and land resources manifested in people’s everyday activities, we can perceive ecology as a material foundation to human capabilities, such as creativity and resilience. As will be argued, the socio-ecological foundation of rural villages in Fiji provides forms of leverage, not simply to resist political and economic forces, but also to envision social change by contesting conditions of monetary dependency inflicted by the capitalist economy. Additionally, I will discuss the historical resilience of subsistence, village-based economics to not only endure different crises, but creatively demonstrating its radical potential for societal reconfiguration. Before proceeding to the chapter overview, I should now discuss some important features related to the Fijian sociality of subsistence economics.  THE SOCIALITY OF SUBSISTENCE ECONOMICS AND LAND TENURE The thesis will show how everyday forms of village practices on Cicia are contingent upon two multifaceted and interconnected features. Firstly, the ecology of land and sea which fundamentally permits a material foundation to different activities and creative arrangements. Secondly, notions of kinship in which these ecological resources are engaged and contested by various social processes. I should briefly note that the thesis does not primarily consider the organized genealogies of Fijian kinship. Genealogical charts of kinship organization have by anthropologists, Ingold observed, commonly been shown as “sequences of dots” (Ingold 2016:3). Dotted lines give us the impression that societal positions are fixed to a structural chart, 14  as fragments assembled by the ethnographer to reconstruct social cohesion onto a document (Ingold 2016:115). By this approach, relations are only narrowly captured, as the marked dots are restrained from moving and thus oversimplify the everyday complexity of social interactions. Instead, by adopting Grønhaug’s (1978) concept of scaling, I will progressively through the different chapters shape a multi-scaled ethnography which strives to account for the different and sliding dimensions of interactive, overlapping, and temporal social fields. By doing so, the ethnography aims to explain not just how ecology manifests itself socially in places like Cicia, but also how the environment is “deeply enmeshed in global economic and political processes” that local people actively engage with (Friedman 2005:279). My attention to Fijian sociality then, does not focus on analyzing lines of decent. Rather, it examines people’s experiences and perspectives on different social processes and dynamics in which kinship relations are elucidated within the social domain of subsistence activities. Sahlins (1985) proposed a distinction between what he labeled the prescriptive and performative structures of social relations. His approach stemmed from a discontent with structuralists who attempted to explain acts of people solely based on their prescribed relationships, neglecting how acts themselves can constitute relations (Sahlins 1985:26-27). In Fiji, Sahlins found that foreigners could establish relations of kinship by doing rightful performative acts, typically by associating oneself with the everyday activities of communities (Sahlins 1962:147). Even Fijian chiefs are commonly said to be vulagi (strangers) who came from overseas and were ritualized into the paramount position by consuming yaqona from the land (Toren 1990:241-242). Furthermore, relations of kinship are embedded in people’s spiritual and material connection to the all-embracing land, called vanua, which is perceived as the ultimate source of life (Tuwere 2002). By vernacular conceptions, vanua also extends into the ocean by incorporating coral reefs – known as qoliqoli fishing grounds – which underlines the fundamental inseparability of sea and land in Fiji. The vanua is not simply a site that provides the physical basis for the subsistence economy. It comprises also the people themselves and their ancestors belonging to the vanua which emphasize the interconnectivity of place and performative kinship relationships in people’s everyday practices. As Williksen-Bakker (1990) shows, the vanua is associated by ideas of truthful and rightful manners that are followed to live in accordance with land. This is done from early stages of life by, for instance, the planting of the umbilical cord after the birth of a child. The umbilical cord is meant to be planted with a seed or fruit, which when grown into a tree represents the tied connection of the Fijian person into the social landscape of the vanua (Williksen-Bakker 1990:235-236). Since 15  the bond between people and their vanua is realized by performative actions, the relationship can also disintegrate if customary practices of kinship are not performed in accordance with the different idealized requirements of their vanua (Hulkenberg 2015).  In everyday life, the relations of kinship in Fiji are realized by the daily association of activities through shared households, called vuvale, which Hocart defined as “the people who work together” (Hocart 1929:17). Compositions of households are not necessarily defined by who sleeps in the same living quarters, but rather through the contribution of labor and sharing of kitchens. Similarly, the centrality of sharing meals in Fijian villages is the “most salient marker” of membership to a household and is “itself definitive of kinship” (Toren 1990:39). Although Mabula today comprises of five distinct mataqali units, practices of intermarriage in addition to the daily association between people of different clans makes relations much more fluid and overlapping in practice, being socially pre-composited by various cultural performances. Household leaders are usually the oldest men, referred to as uluni vuvale, meaning ‘the head of the household’. While relational distinctions of chiefs and commoners are important, it is said that each head is his own chief of the dwelling unit (Sahlins 1962:105). This hierarchical division is manifested by seating arrangements during meals where the uluni vuvale is reserved the upper seating position (Toren 1990:62). Thus, while kinship relations are configured by prescriptive labels, they necessitate structural performances by being spatially concretized among people in their everyday practices. Kinship then, as suggested by Sahlins, is the “mutuality of being”, constituted by “a manifold of intersubjective participations” that accommodates for “the various performative modes of relatedness” (Sahlins 2011:10-11). It is important to underline the relevance of kinship with regards to communal property rights in rural iTaukei villages. Despite disruptions of European settlements and social disengagements produced by the colonial intensification of copra production in places like Lau, iTaukei people were reserved rights of tenure to most land in Fiji. Such land cannot be outright sold as private property, as village communities hold customary ownership of territories as a constitutional right. While property relations have, as argued by Sahlins (1962:126), been viewed as subordinate to social relations among indigenous Fijians, controlling local means of production have certainly been important to Fijian communities during the colonial and post-colonial periods. If we compare, for instance, the dissimilar experience of imperialism in Fiji with that of Hawaii, the consequences of tenure rights become strikingly clear. Coinciding with the dramatic fall in the Hawaiian population – mainly due to exposures of Western diseases – following Captain Cook’s arrival in 1778, indigenous people of Hawaii became internally 16  displaced as private property was introduced by American businessmen and missionaries, which contributed to significant losses in communal subsistence bases (Friedman 2005:274). As a result, the formalized land grab both disempowered and alienated Hawaiians by disconnecting them from land they previously had been materially and spiritually a part of (see Osorio 2006). Generations of Hawaiians became marginalized within their own land as capitalistic ventures demolished most forms of communal living. As will be later discussed, the village-based subsistence economic system in Fiji is crucial to how generations of village people have managed to creatively engage with issues of different social scales in their everyday lives. That is not to say that tenure rights are without their own complications in Fiji. For instance, the legal framework of qoliqoli fishing grounds has been severely contested and galvanized social conflicts. While agreement was found between British colonizers and chiefs of iTaukei communities to ensure that customary rights were restored to follow the “customs and traditions of the iTaukei”, the settlement failed to realize customary ownership rights to coral reefs (Sloan and Chand 2016:78). Today, coastal iTaukei communities are granted access to fish and to manage their customary qoliqoli sites for non-commercial purposes, while the Fijian government holds authority to regulate and change jurisdiction over them. This jurisdictive dynamic was further solidified by the ratification of the 1982 UN Convention of the Law and the Sea (UNCLOS) that established a legal framework to states’ sovereignty of sea governance over Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) that in Fiji includes its 411 qoliqoli sites (Sloan and Chand 2016:78-79). Efforts to restore customary tenure ownership have been attempted but fallen short and instead stirred polarization between groups of iTaukei and Indo-Fijian communities. Being descendants of Indian plantation workers brought to Fiji by the British colonists from 1880 to 1916, Indo-Fijians have principally been unable to own land by law as tenure is to follow the customary rights of iTaukei (Bayliss-Smith et al. 1988:2-3). In 2006, the Fijian government proposed legislation intended to resolve the proclaimed “historical wrong” by transferring the proprietary tenure of qoliqoli to the iTaukei (Bryant-Tokalau 2010). Opponents of the bill claimed it neglected and would alienate the Indo-Fijian population by further discriminating property ownership along lines of ethnicity. By then, other controversial legislation had already passed which granted amnesty to a group of iTaukei nationalists who in 2000 helped topple the government of the first Indo-Fijian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry.4 Subsequently, the  4 Two coup d’états also took place in 1987 that were similarly mobilized by a nationalist section of the iTaukei who feared the possibility of being deprived of political influence and tenure rights (Ratuva 2002:131). 17  ruling government was overthrown by another military coup d’état, led by the current sitting prime minister Frank Bainimarama on December 5 in 2006 before the Qoliqoli Bill was signed into law (Ratuva and Lawson 2016:191-192). Although the bill was not the only reason for the coup, it highlighted how the political situation in post-colonial Fiji became significantly affected by the controversial historicity of tenure rights.  CHAPTER OVERVIEW The ethnography of this thesis explores several interconnected and multi-scaled features of the subsistence economy in Lau by disclosing the interactivity between ecological resources and social practices. Centered around the organic certification of Cicia, the thesis will show how people appropriate the authorization to fit a holistic identity of customary lifestyles that not only encompass local practices but also invokes the sociality of interisland relationships. In search of answers to the seemingly simplistic question as to why an island in Fiji is organic, we must therefore begin at the foundation of Fijian sociality, by considering some of the dynamics which are manifested by central activities in communities like Mabula. By examining the household sociality of food sharing, I focus in chapter two on some of the tactile features of everyday village interactions by considering dynamics in the subsistence activities of distributing seafood. An analysis of seafood transmission among households uncovers a total social fact of performative Fijian kinship. In a web of social interconnections and commitments, by considering features of equality and hierarchy, “the totality of society” is realized through customary subsistence practices which express the social institutions of kinship, economics, morality
