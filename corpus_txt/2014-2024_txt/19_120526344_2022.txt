Power outages, forexample due to cascading failures and triggered by extreme weather, have become more fre-quent and severe, and extreme weather events are likely to occur more often in the futurebecause of climate change. Power networks are also put under additional stress due to manystrategies that aim to reduce carbon emissions, for instance electrification of heat and trans-port, whilst increasing dependency on electricity supply.The aims of this thesis are to assess and enhance power network resilience to shocks andstresses. As such, the thesis contributes to a number of areas in power systems research,particularly addressing the understanding and prevention of cascading failures, whichare caused by extreme weather, through probabilistic and risk-based decision strategies.Simulation-based and data-driven methods are combined to present a comprehensive andholistic approach to power network resilience.Two novel cascading failure models specifically designed for resilience analyses are devel-oped, validated, and applied to investigate cascade propagation for a number of scenarios.Whilst cascade acceleration has been observed in extreme cascades in the past, detailedanalyses of cascading failures using historical utility outage data show a cascade acceler-ation in less extreme and more common cascades. Building on the cascading failure mod-els, preventive actions, and in particular intentional islanding, are shown to be operationalmethods that can reduce the risk of cascading failures, reduce lost load, and improve powernetwork resilience. The decision to apply preventive actions must be based on a risk assess-ment and be made dependent on the specific circumstances of the event. To address this,probabilistic approaches, that consider uncertainty inherent in the impact of extreme eventson power networks, are assessed and optimised. Subsequently, two decision-making frame-works for identifying preventive actions, that are likely to perform best considering un-certainty about upcoming extreme events, are developed and evaluated. As computationalcomplexity of decision-making remains an issue, a novel real-time decision-making tool isdeveloped using machine learning. The tool is able to accurately and efficiently identify themost suitable preventive action for a given extreme event, based only on event parametersthat are readily available ahead of the event. Finally, a data-driven methodology for evaluat-ing power network resilience based on utility outage data is proposed and applied. A noveland comprehensive data set of power outages is created, allowing for in-depth analysis ofcauses and implications of power outages in both spatial and temporal dimension, and sup-plementing simulation-driven approaches to power network resilience.16Declaration of originalityI hereby confirm that no portion of the work referred to in the thesis has been submitted insupport of an application for another degree or qualification of this or any other universityor other institute of learning.17Copyright statementi The author of this thesis (including any appendices and/or schedules to this thesis)owns certain copyright or related rights in it (the “Copyright”) and s/he has given TheUniversity of Manchester certain rights to use such Copyright, including for adminis-trative purposes.ii Copies of this thesis, either in full or in extracts and whether in hard or electroniccopy, may be made only in accordance with the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act1988 (as amended) and regulations issued under it or, where appropriate, in accor-dance with licensing agreements which the University has from time to time.

Almost every aspect of our livesdepends on the availability of electricity, for example hospitals, street lights, water sup-ply, or communication. During the last one hundred years, electricity system demand (ortotal electricity supplied) in Great Britain (GB) has increased from around 4.0 TWh in1920 to a maximum of 376.8 TWh in 2005, and then dropped again to 295.8 TWh in 2020(Fig. 1.1) [1]. The rise in electricity demand is strongly coupled to continuous economicgrowth, with the recent drop largely being related to a combination of energy efficiencymeasures, environmentally conscious consumers, offshoring of energy-intensive industries,and rising electricity prices [2]. Most recently, electricity demand further reduced followingthe impact of the Coronavirus pandemic [3]. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 1920  1940  1960  1980  2000  2020  2040Annual GB electricity system demand (TWh)YearHistoricalConsumer TransformationSystem TransformationLeading the WaySteady ProgressionFigure 1.1: Historical and projected annual GB electricity system demand [1], [4].Electricity demand is likely to increase in the future. The Future Energy Scenarios, whichare published annually by National Grid ESO, consider several pathways for GB’s energy20landscape until 2050. They project an increase in electricity system demand for all scenar-ios, up to 701.6 TWh by 2050 in the “Consumer Transformation” scenario (Fig. 1.1) [4].This can largely be attributed to gradual electrification of heat and transport, electrifica-tion of industrial processes, and increasing usage of electricity for the production of fuelsthrough electrolysis [4]. In other scenarios, annual electricity system demand is projected toincrease to 686.3 TWh (“Leading the Way”), 559.1 TWh (“System Transformation”), and459.3 TWh (“Steady Progression”) [4].The total end consumer energy demand is projected to drop by 2050, however, the share ofelectricity in the GB end consumer energy demand is projected to increase significantly inall scenarios (Fig. 1.2). In 2020, this share was 18.8% [4]. The largest increase is projectedfor the “Consumer Transformation” scenario, in which the share of electricity is estimatedat 83.9% [4]. In other scenarios, the share is projected to increase to 66.7% (“Leading theWay”), 48.5% (“System Transformation”), and 40.5% (“Steady Progression”) [4]. Othermajor fuels include natural gas, blended gas, hydrogen either from electrolysis or methanereforming, biofuels, and oil/petroleum. Note that these numbers include residential, trans-port, industrial and commercial demand, but not the demand for aviation, rail and maritime. 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 14002020 ConsumerTransformation2050SystemTransformation2050Leadingthe Way2050SteadyProgression2050Annual GB end consumer energy demand (TWh)ElectricityNatural gasBlended gasHydrogenOil/petroleumBiofuelsFigure 1.2: Annual GB end consumer energy demand in 2020 and 2050 [4].An increased usage of electricity, however, also increases the dependence on the electric-ity network. This dependence becomes most noticeable, if the network supplying us withelectricity fails and an outage occurs.211.2 Natural Hazards as a Risk for Power NetworksReliability of electricity supply in European countries has been on continuously high oreven improving levels [5]. Nowadays, the time consumers are without electricity supply isbelow 200 minutes per year for most European countries [6]. In GB and according to ev-idence given by the Institute of Engineering and Technology (IET) to the House of LordsScience and Technology Select Committee, also resilience of electricity networks had lastbeen an issue in the 1970s, when security of supply was threatened due to industrial actionby coal miners and railway workers [7].At least since beginning of the current century, reliability of electricity networks has con-tinuously increased both in GB and in Europe in general [5]. Excluding exceptional eventsand considering only unplanned outages, the GB System Average Interruption FrequencyIndex (SAIFI) dropped from 0.87 interruptions per customer in 2002 to 0.48 interruptionsper customer in 2016 (Fig. 1.3). At the same time, the GB System Average Interruption Du-ration Index (SAIDI) dropped from 81.66 minutes per customer in 2002 to 38.39 minutesper customer in 2016 (Fig. 1.4). However, when including exceptional events in the cal-culation of SAIFI and SAIDI, the downward trend becomes much more volatile. Spikesin SAIFI and SAIDI of up to 20% and 74%, respectively, above non-exceptional levelscan be observed for individual years. Two types of exceptional events are distinguished inthe methodology for GB interruption statistics. Weather-related exceptional events are de-fined as “the ones resulting in a fault of more than eight times the daily average fault rate onhigher voltages” [8, p. 52]. Non-weather exceptional events are defined as “events outsidethe [Distribution Network Operator’s] control that results in more than 25,000 customersinterrupted and/or 2 million customer-minutes lost” [8, p. 52]. 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 2002  2004  2006  2008  2010  2012  2014  2016Unplanned SAIFI(interruptions per customer)YearExcluding exceptional eventsIncluding exceptional eventsFigure 1.3: Unplanned GB System Average Interruption Frequency Index [5].Natural hazards and extreme weather belong to the main causes for large-scale power out-ages, as a study investigating the reason and extent of major power outages in the US duringthe period from 1986-2006 finds [9].

The results show that while equipment failure wasthe reason for almost a third of the power outages, the number of affected customers and themean power not supplied was low compared to power outages caused by natural hazards.Hurricanes, ice storms, and earthquakes in particular were the reason for only a few out-ages, but each of the outages affected hundreds of thousands of customers with over a GWof power not supplied on average.Table 1.1: Causes for power outages in the US during the period from 1986-2006 [9].% of events Mean size in MW Mean size in customersEarthquake 0.8 1,408 375,900Tornado 2.8 367 115,439Hurricane / tropical storm 4.2 1,309 782,695Ice storm 5.0 1,152 343,448Lightning 11.3 270 70,944Wind/rain 14.8 793 185,199Other cold weather 5.5 542 150,255Fire 5.2 431 111,244Equipment failure 29.7 379 57,140The link between extreme weather and large-scale power outages raises the questionwhether the frequency of large-scale power outages is likely to increase in the future. Thenumber of major outages in the US due to extreme weather, where major is defined as atleast 50,000 customers affected, has at least doubled from 2003 to 2012 (Fig. 1.5), as astudy finds [10]. Going back to mid-1980s, the increase to 2012 is tenfold, although someof the increase can be related to improved outage reporting. According to the study, be-tween 2003 and 2012 80% of major power cuts and 88% of customers affected by ma-jor power cuts were weather-related, incurring costs estimated between $20 and $55 bil-lion annually. Storms and severe weather were identified as the most prominent reason forweather-related outages, and major outages mainly came from damage to large transmissionlines or substations, as opposed to distribution networks. The study concludes that climate23change is, at most, “partially responsible for this recent increase in major power outages,which is a product of an aging grid serving greater electricity demand, and an increase instorms and extreme weather events that damage this system” [10, p. 4]. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 1984  1988  1992  1996  2000  2004  2008  2012Major power outages per yearYearNon-weather related Weather-relatedFigure 1.5: Non-weather-related and weather-related major power outages in the US [10].Whilst weather and climate extremes would occur even without anthropogenic climatechange, the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of such extremes is af-fected by changing climate [11]. This can also result in unprecedented extremes. For theUK, particularly the frequency of heatwaves and hot spells as well as precipitation extremesis projected to increase [12]. Projections for windstorms are less certain, and there is lowconfidence in projections of changes in extreme winds. However, this low confidence is at-tributed to the small number of studies and shortcomings in the simulation of these events[11]. For the UK, mean wind speeds over the winter season are likely to increase, but so far,no links between changes in UK storminess and climate change have been observed [13].1.3 Emerging Need for Resilience to Shocks and StressesExtreme weather and climate change is just one of the many factors that put power sys-tems increasingly at risk. Others include: ageing and deteriorating assets; natural hazards;geopolitical uncertainty; population growth; increasingly interconnected and interdependentsystems; new, disruptive technologies; human error; physical and cyber-security threats;and changing consumer expectations [14].Factors putting power systems at risk can further be differentiated into shocks and stresses.Shocks are “sudden events that impact on the vulnerability of the system and its compo-nents” [15, p. 8]. Stresses are “long-term trends that undermine the potential of a givensystem or process and increase the vulnerability of actors within it” [15, p. 8]. Shocks andstresses are often connected, which further intensifies the risk. For example, climate changeleads to continuously growing stress due to increasing uncertainty in weather patterns, butit also increases the risk of shocks in form of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes orheat waves.24The variety of threats to power networks, that eventually lead to a loss of power, but alsothe following recovery process and any long-term consequences can be illustrated via abow-tie diagram (Fig. 1.6). The bow-tie diagram is a risk management tool that emphasisesthrough its shape that events, such as power outages, can often have multiple and also coin-ciding causes, and there rarely is a single cause for such an event. For example, in terms ofpower outages, an outage may occur as a combination of a windstorm, structurally weak-ened network assets, and a network design that does not provide sufficient redundancy.Similarly, there is no single but multiple consequences of an extreme event, for example,depending on where the event hits and who is affected. These considerations also mean thatthere is a range of prevention and recovery mechanisms that can reduce the risk of extremeevents.Figure 1.6: Bow-tie diagram and relation to the CIGRE resilience definition [16].The ability of a system to limit the extent, severity, and duration of system degradation fol-lowing shocks and stresses is generally understood as resilience. According to work by theCIGRE working group C4.47 “Power System Resilience”, this ability can be achieved bytaking key actionable measures before, during, and after extreme events. These include: (1)anticipation; (2) preparation; (3) absorption; (4) sustainment of critical system operations;(5) rapid recovery; (6) adaptation; and (7) application of lessons learnt [16]. Fig. 1.6 illus-trates how the key actionable measures can be linked to the different phases of the bow-tierisk management approach. A more in-depth review of resilience definitions and discussionof threats to power system is later provided in Chapter 2.1.4 Research Aims and ObjectivesThe aims of this thesis are to assess and enhance power network resilience to shocks andstresses, in particular cascading failures which are triggered by extreme weather and are po-tentially exacerbated through increasing network complexity, growing demand, and largeramounts of distributed generation. Operational, preventive methods, which can build thecapabilities of a modern smart grid and require less investments in bulk infrastructure,are considered as the main strategies for enhancing power network resilience. In order toachieve these aims, the following research objectives have been defined:25RO1 To review definitions and metrics for resilience of power networks to current andemerging threats, and to identify definitions and metrics that address the multi-dimensionality and dynamic nature of resilience as well as being suitable for quanti-tative analysis of resilience enhancement measures.RO2 To develop cascading failure models suitable for resilience analyses that evaluate thepreviously identified resilience metrics, and to investigate the characteristics and im-pacts of cascading failures under current and future conditions.RO3 To quantify the extent to which preventive actions, and in particular intentional island-ing, can reduce the risk of cascading failures and improve power network resilience toextreme events.RO4 To assess and optimise the extent to which power network resilience can be improvedthrough probabilistic approaches, that, compared to traditional deterministic reliabilitycriteria, consider uncertainty inherent in the impact of extreme events on power net-works.RO5 To evaluate and analyse utility outage data to improve the understanding of the effectof shocks and stresses on power networks, and to correlate those data to meteorologi-cal and geographical data.1.5 Main Contributions of this ThesisThis thesis contributes to a number of areas in power systems research, particularly theanalysis of power network resilience to shocks and stresses. These contributions mainlyaddress the understanding and prevention of cascading failures, which are caused by ex-treme weather, through probabilistic and risk-based decision strategies. Simulation-basedand data-driven methods are combined to present a comprehensive approach to power net-work resilience.The specific contributions of this thesis are as follows:• Development of an AC cascading failure model specifically designed for resiliencestudies that integrates seamlessly into established resilience metric frameworks. Com-pared to existing cascading failure models, this model explicitly incorporates dynamicphenomena such as voltage and frequency protection mechanisms but is stable forvery large contingencies and provides reliable results even under extreme conditions.In addition, the model is validated following the approaches by the IEEE PES workinggroup on cascading failures.• Acknowledging previously observed acceleration of extreme cascading outages, ananalysis of acceleration in more common cascading failures based on utility outagedata. The existence and amount of such an acceleration of cascading outages deter-mines the viability of mitigation measures.26• A risk-based modelling framework for evaluating and quantifying the effect of pre-ventive actions, such as intentional islanding, balancing flexible pre-event demandresponse and post-event lost load. Compared to other frameworks, this frameworkseparates the risk assessment into stages that reflect the computational complexity ofthe methodology, allowing more complex steps to be performed offline, and steps thatneed to consider quickly evolving and changing conditions online in real-time.• An investigation of the effect of preventive, intentional islanding on both island ade-quacy and network resilience to both static and dynamically evolving extreme events.This investigation closes an existing research gap between islanding algorithms, cas-cading failure analysis and resilience assessment using suitable metrics.• Two probabilistic decision-making processes for network operators to reach perfor-mance-driven decisions on preventive actions for weather-related extreme events underuncertainty. Uncertainty inherent in power systems and weather forecasts as well asthe performance of preventive actions under varying levels and sources of uncertaintyhas not been adequately considered prior to this work. The novel processes developedhere specifically consider spatial uncertainty and uncertainty in weather intensity.• Building on the findings of these decision-making processes, an in-depth descriptionand evaluation of a novel real-time decision-making tool for preventive actions im-proving power network resilience based on machine learning. This includes evaluationof the performance of this decision-making tool via a probabilistic methodology forsimulating and quantifying the risk of extreme events on power networks.• A comprehensive and novel data set of power outages affecting the UK distributionnetworks, and, for the first time, a systematic and in-depth analysis of causes and im-plications of power outages in the UK in both spatial and temporal resolution.1.6 Thesis OverviewThis thesis consists of eight chapters in total. The seven chapters which follow this intro-duction are outlined below and cover different aspects of the CIGRE resilience definition.This is illustrated in Fig. 1.7.Chapter 2 - Resilience of Power Networks introduces the concept of resilience with afocus on resilience of power networks, building the foundation for the rest of this thesis.Whilst resilience is recognised as an emerging need in academia, industry, policy and so-ciety, there is ambiguity in what resilience actually means and how it is to be differentiatedfrom other concepts, such as reliability. The chapter provides a differentiation into four di-mensions: infrastructure, operational, organisational and community resilience, and mea-sures for enhancing power network resilience are described. In the chapter, resilience met-rics are reviewed and frameworks to quantify resilience are discussed, capturing the multi-dimensionality and dynamic nature of resilience.27Figure 1.7: Outline of this thesis with respect to the CIGRE resilience definition [16].Chapter 3 - Cascading Failures in Power Networks presents an in-depth discussion andcomprehensive analysis of cascading failures in the context of power network resilience.The identification of a lack of a dedicated cascading failure model for resilience then leadsto the development and implementation of two novel models: A simple DC cascading fail-ure model and a comprehensive AC cascading failure model, which additionally considersdynamic phenomena such as voltage and frequency protection in a static, computationallyefficient representation. The characteristics of both models are thoroughly discussed andvalidated following recommendations by the IEEE PES working group on cascading fail-ures. Furthermore, in the chapter, the particular need for using historical data in cascadingfailure analysis is addressed, specifically when considering cascade propagation speed.Chapter 4 - Resilience Enhancement through Intentional Islanding discusses the poten-tial of intentional islanding in transmission networks to enhance power network resilienceto shocks and stresses, and supports this discussion via comprehensive resilience assess-ment through simulations of extreme events. Intentional islanding is one of the operationalmeasures that can enhance power network resilience. It is, in this context, understood asdeliberately splitting a network in critical situations into separated, controllable areas, thuspreventing the uncontrolled propagation of cascading failures. In the chapter, mathemati-cal concepts and algorithms for determining the optimum way of islanding a power networkare described. Comprehensive investigations and quantification of the effect of preventiveislanding on power network resilience are undertaken, building on the AC and DC cascad-ing failure models previously presented. Time-series analysis of extreme events shown inthis chapter also demonstrate the benefit of recovery phases in conjunction with preventiveislanding in reducing energy not supplied and increasing resilience of power networks. Thisbridges the gap between islanding, cascading failure analysis and network resilience.Chapter 5 - Enhancing Resilience under Uncertainty discusses how power networkresilience can be enhanced when considering uncertainty. Considering uncertainty indecision-making can improve the quality of the decision and reduce adverse impacts, forexample load shedding and lost load that results from applying a preventive action aheadof an extreme event. In the chapter, it is explored how uncertainty in power networks28has traditionally been addressed via deterministic reliability criteria. It is also discussedhow probabilistic approaches can overcome shortcomings of traditional deterministic ap-proaches. Two probabilistic methodologies for modelling uncertainties in power networksare described and discussed, a combinatory and a Monte Carlo approach. The suitability ofboth approaches and their benefits and limitations are demonstrated for two applications: Anovel framework for performance-driven decision-making on preventive actions under spa-tial uncertainty, and the design and investigation of probabilistic
