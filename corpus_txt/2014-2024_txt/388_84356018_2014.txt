Abstract
The recovery of olive stone for biofuel purpose is becoming increas-
ingly widespread in olive milling plants. The study looks at the eco-
nomic and energetic benefits of using a de-stoner machine in a small-
to-medium sized oil milling plant. The performance of the olive stone
recovery system was evaluated over a full olive oil production season.
The energetic viability of the de-stoner was assessed using an energy
balance. The break-even point was achieved when about 76 tons of
olives had been processed, which is less than the annual production of
the mill under study. Similarly, in economic terms, the machine cov-
ered its costs after about the half of its technical life.
Introduction
Energy generation from biomass is becoming more widespread and
gaining in popularity worldwide. Biomass is a generic term for all
organic matter produced as a result of photosynthesis, as well as
municipal, animal and industrial organic waste. Among these, agricul-
tural by-products are attracting increasing interest (Demirbas, 2005).
The review by Rodríguez et al. (2008) showed that the olive oil indus-
try produces significant quantities of by-products, including a valuable
lignocellulosic biomass, namely olive stones (OS), which can be used
as biofuel. In fact, based on its combustion performance (Miranda et
al., 2008), OS are a viable alternative to wood pellets (a biomass fuel
that is experiencing considerable market expansion). According to
Cordero et al. (2004), OS are also characterized by low ash content and
very low sulphur content that indicate a high-quality fuel. 
With regard to olive oil extraction systems, the main by-products of
the process are vegetation water and so-called virgin pomace oil (VP).
This is a coarse, semi-solid mixture containing residual oils, water and
the drupe’s solid parts (pulp and woody fragments of the pits) that are
left over from the crushing phase. This latter fraction can be separated
at various times during processing with differing degrees of efficiency,
including: from the olive paste before oil extraction, from the virgin
pomace immediately after mechanical oil extraction, and from the
exhausted pomace after solvent extraction of the residual oil (Pattara
et al., 2010). The amount of VP and OS is highly dependent on the sys-
tem that is adopted for the extraction of the olive oil. Among the three
most widespread extraction techniques (pressing, three and two-
phase decanter) the amount of VP obtained, thus the amount of waste
material generated, varies from 25% for pressing to 85% for the two-
phase decanter technique, by weight of olive drupes mass (Di
Giovacchino and Prezioso, 2006). The recovery of OS ranges from 12-
20% of the processed VP mass. Despite this variability, few studies
have focused on the energetic and economic viability of OS recovery.
This study examines an industrial plant equipped with a three-phase
decanter. This configuration was chosen as it is in widespread use and
representative of a large number of Italian olive oil mills.
Materials and methods
Experimental procedure
The study was carried out at an industrial olive mill in the South of
Italy (the Calabria region). The mill operates a continuous three-
phase horizontal centrifuge [4015 CI Plus, Barracane s.r.l., Modugno
(BA), Italy], with an actual work rate of about 1000 kg h–1 of olive dru-
pes and a yearly running time of 650 h year–1. The plant was also
equipped with a continuous de-stoner machine [5DN/SP, Clemente
s.r.l., Flagogna (UD), Italy] that separated OS from VP. This machine
uses a cylindrical fixed grid and an inner screw conveyor rotating at
1350 rpm to separate the two materials. The grid (length 0.95 m, inter-
nal diameter 0.40 m) has two contiguous sections of length 0.2 and 0.7
m, and mesh size of 2.7 and 2.0 mm respectively. The VP is continuous-
ly fed into the grid through a stationary inlet tube. The centrifugal
force causes solids to accumulation on the wall of the grid and the
extrusion of all materials (mainly pulp) with dimensions smaller than
the mesh size. The rotating conveyor continuously removes the solids
(mainly OS) that are caught by the grid and moves them towards the
discharge outlet. The machine was equipped with three, three-phase
alternating-current (AC) motors (380 V), which were used, respective-
ly, to feed the VP (0.75 kW), discharge the separated products (0.75

kW), and move the rotating conveyor (15 kW). The total installed power
was therefore 16.5 kW. The mill’s standard working procedure involved
batch processing of different varieties of olive drupes, mainly the culti-
vars grossa di cassano, carolea and tondina in variable proportions. The
estimated annual processing capacity of olive drupes was about 650
tons. In order to take into account changes in the physical properties of
olives during the harvesting season (October to December), three tests
were performed at 15-day intervals. In each test the de-stoner machine
was monitored for three consecutive working days. Its electric energy
consumption and the flow of mass materials (olive drupes and OS) dur-
ing the standard OS recovery process were recorded. Moreover, during
each trial, an OS sample (one sample per working day) was taken and
the moisture content determined. 
Analyses
Electric energy consumption of the de-stoner was recorded by means
of a portable electrical network analyser [model Multiver 3SN from
Dossena s.n.c., Cavenago d’Adda (LO), Italy].
The moisture content of OS was determined by drying 50 g samples
at a temperature of 105°C in a mechanical convection air oven, and cal-
culated from the loss in mass of the samples (Samuelsson et al., 2006).
The energy analysis was performed taking into account the follow-
ing entries: i) embedded energy of the OS extraction machine (de-
stoner); this energy corresponds to the sum of fossil energy required
to produce the machine and the energy required to deliver it to the
farm; ii) the conventional energy required producing electricity to
run the de-stoner; iii) the thermal energy potentially available from
the combustion of OS.
Specific data on the embedded energy of the de-stoner are unavail-
able in literature, thus data were gathered from Audsley (1997) under
the entry named agricultural inputs - other machines. Specifically,
Audsley (1997) reports the total fossil energy for the following cate-
gories that were summed up to determine the embedded energy of the
de-stoner: materials input (48.46 MJ kg–1), manufacturing (19.61 MJ
kg–1), repairs and maintenance (21.63 MJ kg–1), transport to the farm
(0.0005377 MJ kg km–1). Considering a mass of the de-stoner of 850 kg
and a distance of 223 km between the manufacturer site and the farm
under study, the total embedded energy of the de-stoner accounts to
76,347 MJ. The conventional energy required for the de-stoner opera-
tion was assessed on the base of the grid electricity consumption
recorded during the trials and energy required for the production of
electricity itself. The latter was computed from the process of electricity
production inventoried in ELCD core II life cycle assessment (LCA)
database, named Electricity Mix, consumption mix, at consumer, AC,
1kV - 60kV IT referred to the Italian mix at 2010. The process dataset
was imported (ILCD format) in openLCA and analyzed according to the
impact assessment method of cumulative energy demand. The method
maps all the energy flows needed to produce 1 MJ of electric energy.
The computation gives 2.95 MJ MJEL–1 (corresponding to 10.92 MJ
kWhEL–1) shared as 75 % fossil sources, 12.5 nuclear sources, and 12.5
renewable sources. 
The thermal energy potentially available from the combustion of OS
has been estimated assuming a lower heating value (LHV) of 19.2 MJ
kg–1 OS dry basis, according to Mata-Sánchez et al. (2014). All the ener-
gy computations were referred to the OS dry weigh, based on the aver-
age OS moisture content determined during the trials. Furthermore,
the thermal energy potentially available from OS was considered irre-
spective of the thermal conversion devices, thus any conversion effi-
ciency has been considered.
The economic analysis was based on the estimation of the following
indicators:
- net present value (NPV):

where N is the life of the de-stoner machine, assumed to be 8 years, i
is the annual interest rate, assumed to be 6%, Fk is the annual flow cash
in the kth year, and TCI is the total capital investment. Fk is calculated
as: Fk = ROS − TOC, where ROS is the revenue generated from the sale
of OS and TOC is total operating costs;
- profitability index (PI):

NPV value zero;
- payback time (PBT): defined as the time required recovering the ini-
tial investment.
Results and discussion
Table 1 reports the moisture content of OS sampled during trials.
Immediately after separation, the overall average moisture content was
of 22.1% (standard deviation of 2.1). Moisture tends to increase during
the harvest season, by about 4% moving from the first to last test. The
recorded values agree with what has been recently reported by Mata-
Sánchez et al. (2014), where the limit value of the third quartile of 176
OS samples from Spanish mills was 20.83%, with a strong variability
spanning from 5.80 (minimum) to 33.20% (maximum). However,
before it is sold as a fuel, the product usually undergoes pre-treatments
such as cleaning or drying processes to allow reducing the moisture
content to about 10-12% (Mata-Sánchez et al., 2014). Figure 1 gives an
example of the instantaneous absorbed electrical power during the de-
stoner operation, monitored in one out of the three trials belonging to
the first test. It is evident the occurrence of several power peaks, that
in some cases differ considerably from the mean value. This was sup-
ported by the results of the statistical analysis showed in Table 2, where
for the sake of simplicity the statistical outputs refer specifically to data
of Figure 1. The same outcome has been found for all the other trials.
According to Table 2, the mean adsorbed electrical power had some
variability as stated by its standard deviation, that accounts for about
28% of the mean (variation coefficient). Nevertheless, the range is
quite high (13.34 kW), mirroring the presence of the power peaks
(above and below the mean) showed in Figure 1. The 5th and 95th per-
centiles limits were 3.6 and 11.22 kW, respectively, corresponding to a
percentage deviation from the median of 56% and +36% respectively.
Outliers detection (Hadi Robust Outlier Detection method) identified
94 cases, i.e. about 14% of total recorded cases. Of these, 24 cases

belong to the 5th percentile (lower than 3.6 kW) and 10 belong to the
95th percentile (higher than 11.22 kW). As stated above, a similar
behaviour was recorded in all tests, with slightly differences in the
number and magnitude of power peaks, as well as the average input
power. Operating parameters are summarized in Table 3, and the cor-
responding process performance indicators are shown in Table 4. Mean
input power was around 9.9 kW (standard deviation of 1.14 kW), with
slightly higher values for the second test. Electric energy consumption
averaged 2.02 MJ per kg of dry OS produced. There was variability
between the three tests as stated by a variation coefficient of about
16%, where the electrical energy consumption tended to increase as
the season progressed. On average, olive stone yield was 5.84 kg dry
mass (0.12 standard deviation) per 100 kg of processed drupes. As
shown in Figure 1, there were periods of variable length, during which
power absorption was minimal. These intervals correspond to dead
times, i.e. times when the machine was empty, resulting in energy con-
sumption with no productivity. It is therefore interesting to estimate
the effect of these dead times on the total working time of the machine.
To this end, we assumed dead times to include all those periods that
lasted at least five consecutive minutes, during which the power
requirement was less than 4 kW (i.e. the input power when the de-ston-
er was empty and representing the minimal electric load). This thresh-
old value was selected according to the outliers detection reported
above, where of the 94 outlying cases, 84 cases fall below 4 kW. Of
these, 60 cases belong to the 95th percentile being lower than 3.6 kW,
and corresponding to about 24% of total installed power of the de-ston-
er supporting the importance of these dead time on the overall per-
formance of the machine. As shown in Table 3, dead times accounted
for 4.3% of total energy consumption on average (1.16 standard devia-
tion). Based on the data collected during de-stoner operation, an ener-
gy analysis of the OS recovery process was carried out. This evaluated
the total quantity of OS to be produced such as the thermal energy
potentially available from OS combustion (thermal energy revenue,
namely TER), equals (energy break-even point, namely EBP) the total
energy required for the recovery process (total energy cost, namely
TEC):
EBP = TER-TEC; EPB = 0                                                                 (3)
The term TEC in equation 3 was computed as the sum of the embed-
ded energy of the de-stoner (fixed energy cost) plus the total operating
electrical energy of de-stoner for a given amount of OS to be processed
and resulting from the product of OS average specific electrical energy
consumption (as MJ kg–1 OS) of Table 4 and the amount of processed
OS. The term TER was computed as the product between the OS LHV
(19.2 MJ kg–1 dry weigh) and the produced amount of OS. Both the
energy terms TEC and TER were plotted in Figure 2 as a function of
increasing amount of produced OS. The EBP, corresponding to the
intersection of the two straight lines, resulted of about 4444 kg of OS to
be produced. Assuming an OS recovery yield (dry weigh) of 0.0584 kg
kg–1 of olive mass, about 76,095 kg of olive have to be processed to
reach the EBP. In the case under study, this value was reached in the
first year after the de-stoner installation. The economic viability of OS
recovery was proved by calculating the NPV, PI, IRR investment and
PBT (Table 5). This economic analysis is based on current conditions
in the oil mill used in this case study, where the recovered OS was sold.
Some further assumptions were made in order to simplify the analy-
sis: i) in the energy calculation, OS recovery was considered as a sep-
arate activity, from an economic point of view, to that of oil production;
ii) the cost of the VP used in OS recovery was considered to be null as
the mill can use it with no cost; iii) the average selling price of OS was
0.14 € kg–1, assessed by a local market analysis; iv) the by-products of
the OS separation process (de-stoned pomace) can be disposed of with
no extra costs as waste or soil amendment or sent to the pomace pro-
cessing plant and generates no revenue; v) the de-stoner was assumed
to have a lifespan of 8 years (the term of the investment); vi) the mean
annual OS production was estimated as 48,750 kg, based on a yield of
7.5% (wet basis) of olive drupes processed; vii) in the NPV computa-
tion, TCI corresponds to the purchase cost for the de-stoner machine,

assumed to be 20,000 €; viii) TOC correspond to the sum of repairs and
maintenance costs (assumed to be 10% of the cost of the de-stoner
machine); insurance costs (assumed to be 1.5% of the cost of the de-
stoner); electricity costs (estimated on the basis of data collected dur-
ing monitoring of the de-stoner machine and applying the rates of the
Italian Electricity and Gas Authority) equal to 0.0333 € MJ–1.
The economic parameters reported in Table 4 confirm the economic
viability of olive stone recovery (profitability of investment).
Specifically, the PI is higher than 1 and the IRR was significantly high-
er than the capital cost (assumed to be 6%). Finally, the PBT corre-
sponds to the 4th working season.
In broader terms, given the boundary conditions used here, the eco-
nomic break-even point is reached after 2600 t of olive oil has been
processed and when the de-stoner processes 195 t OS per year.
Conclusions
Our results clearly confirm the viability of OS recovery in the oil mill
under study, both in view of energetic and economic analyses. The
framework for our work is typical of the situation for Italian olive mill
plants and can be effectively extended to many other olive oil produc-
tion scenarios. From the energy perspective, the de-stoner covers the
cost of OS extraction when about 76 t of olive are processed per year
(the equivalent of 4.4 t of dry OS). This means that there is a potential
energetic advantage for most olive processing plants. From an econom-
ic standpoint, although various assumptions had to be made regarding
the assessment and importance of the context in which the plant oper-
ated, the de-stoner plant began to pay for itself during the fourth sea-
son, i.e. about half the assumed plant). Monitoring of the operations of
the de-pitting machine showed some variability in electricity consump-
tion, mainly due to variability of the virgin pomace to be processed.
Electricity adsorption monitoring also made it possible to evaluate con-
sumption in idle periods, which accounted for about 4.7% of the total
energy consumed. This is an energy loss that could be saved by a proper
setting of virgin pomace feeding to the de-stoner. The OS recovery
seems to be a major opportunity for the olive oil production sector, and
offers a supplementary income for olive mills.
