The study utilizes qualitative methodologies to scrutinize the multifaceted role and profound influence of tourism within the designated region. This statement highlights the crucial significance of implementing sustainable tourism practices, fostering community engagement, and promoting equitable employment opportunities. The research endeavors to delineate a myriad of tactics aimed at fostering economic resurgence, encompassing initiatives such as programs focused on enhancing capabilities, the utilization of data to inform policy decisions, and harmonized endeavors to bolster the tourism sector. The research proposes a set of strategic measures aimed at maximizing the economic prospects of the tourism industry. These measures encompass the implementation of capacity-building initiatives targeted at local communities, with the objective of augmenting their skill sets and enhancing their employability. The imperative of guaranteeing equitable employment prospects and fostering sustainable practices cannot be overstated. In addition, it is imperative for the government and key players in the tourism industry to prioritize the implementation of a data-driven strategy in policymaking and coordination efforts, with the ultimate goal of rejuvenating the tourism sector in South Sulawesi Province. Introduction Tourism development has become a distinct government strategy to improve the livelihoods of rural residents (Yu et al., 2020). However, having tourism development requires attention because excessive development can cause damage to the natural environment. Nature-based tourism development is used as a government approach to minimize negative impacts. Economic development is expected to be able to significantly improve community welfare, this can be done through systematic local economic development (Kline & Moretti, 2014). Therefore, a sustainable livelihood system is needed to help overcome local economic problems. The concept of sustainable livelihoods (SL) is an effort to go beyond conventional definitions and approaches to poverty alleviation (Su et al., 2021). It is considered too narrow because it only focuses on certain aspects or manifestations of poverty, such as low income, or does not consider other vital aspects of poverty such as vulnerability and social exclusion. It is now recognized that more attention must be paid to the factors and processes that limit or enhance the ability of poor people to earn a living in economically, ecologically, and socially   JOURNAL LA BISECOMAN  VOL. 04, ISSUE 01 (017-023), 2023 DOI: 10.37899/journallabisecoman.v4i1.882    18 ISSN 2721-0987 (Print), ISSN 2721-124X (Online) Copyright © 2023, Journal La Bisecoman, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 sustainable ways. The Sustainable Livelihood concept offers a more coherent and integrated approach to poverty (Krantz, 2001). Livelihoods consist of the capabilities, assets (repositories, resources, claims and access) and activities necessary for a means of living: sustainable livelihoods that can cope with and recover from stresses and shocks, maintain or enhance their capabilities and assets, and provide adequate livelihood opportunities. sustainable for the next generation; and that provide net benefits to other livelihoods at local and global levels and in the short and long term. (Krantz, 2011) divides 5 important capital in sustainable livelihoods that can be applied in the sustainable development process, namely human capital, natural capital, physical capital, financial capital and social capital. Bulukumba Regency is one of the districts in South Sulawesi Province which is a destination visited by many tourists, both domestic and foreign tourists. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, destinations in Bulukumba Regency, such as the Bira Beach area and its surroundings, were already visited by many tourists. However, at the beginning of 2020, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was also felt by tourist destinations, which of course also had an impact on the income of local people at these destinations. Bulukumba Regency is one of the destinations that has felt the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, after the transition from the pandemic to the Covid-19 endemic, several places that are tourist attractions in Bulukumba have been used as new destinations or tourist destinations apart from Bira Beach, which was previously visited by many tourists. This tourist attraction is managed directly by the local community with coordination and guidance from the district and provincial governments, in this case the tourism office. Several villages have even taken part in the competition and received the tourist village award (ADWI) which is one of the flagships of the central government, namely the Ministry of Tourism and Creative Economy. According to Hardjosoekarto & Lawang (2021) Information from the local government is that several villages that have not previously focused on tourism activities are trying to become tourist villages. This will certainly encourage the economy of local communities in these villages. In 2021, Ara Village received the top 50 Tourism Village Award (ADWI) and in 2023 Lembanna Village received the top 75 Tourism Village Award (ADWI). Village tourism is a form of tourism development that focuses on local potential in a village, including villages in Bulukumba Regency. Tourism villages open up new opportunities to increase local community income, preserve natural culture and preserve economic and environmental sustainability (https://dtk.id/N2gtTo, 2023). Several villages have an important role in advancing regional tourism potential because village tourism is based on local wisdom which involves the community (https://dtk.id/N5I11m, 2023). One of the guidelines for tourism development is stipulated in the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 10 of 2009 concerning tourism with the objectives of: a) increasing economic growth; b) improving people's welfare; c) eliminating poverty; d) overcoming unemployment; e) preserving nature, environment, and resources; f) advancing culture; g) raising the image of the nation; h) fostering a sense of love for the country; i) strengthening national identity and unity; and j) strengthening friendship between nations. Tourism is one of the development sectors that can spur economic growth in a region (Soemardjan, 1974), so tourism is considered as a strategic asset to encourage development in certain areas that have potential tourist attractions with the development of the tourism industry in a region, the flow of urbanization to big cities can be further suppressed. This is because tourism has three aspects of impact, namely economic aspects (foreign exchange sources, taxes), social aspects (job creation) and cultural aspects (Hartono, 1974). Tourism has a   19 ISSN 2721-0987 (Print), ISSN 2721-124X (Online) Copyright © 2023, Journal La Bisecoman, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 positive effect on economic growth and conversely economic growth has a positive effect on tourism. (Yakup, 2019) The impacts caused by tourism can be both positive and negative impacts on the lives of people in tourism destinations. To prevent changes towards a negative impact, a plan is needed that includes social and economic aspects, so that as far as possible the local community is involved in tourism planning and development. This needs to be done to support the successful development of the tourist destination concerned (Kodhyat, 1982). If many tourists come to a destination, it will have an impact on the economic life of the area, both directly and indirectly. The economic impact can be positive or negative" (I. G. Pitana and Putu, 2009). Pitana, (2009) suggests that the impact of tourism on economic conditions is categorized into 7 categories, namely: (1) impact on foreign exchange earnings (2) impact on community income (3) impact on employment opportunities (4) impact on the distribution of benefits or profits (5) impact on ownership and control of the community economy (6) impact on development in general, and (7) impact on government revenues. Methods This research uses qualitative research methods in the process of data collection, analysis and drawing conclusions which will focus on identifying existing products and the tourism potential of the destination so that new tourism product proposals can be created that are in accordance with the existing potential. Pereira (2017) argues that a qualitative research approach is a research method that functions to examine a condition of a natural object, in which the researcher acts as a key instrument. In the research carried out, primary data is obtained directly in the field or from the research location which is usually referred to as field research. Meanwhile, secondary data which is supporting data for primary data analysis has been processed first and then obtained again from the researcher. What researchers use in looking for data sources is the results of interviews with stakeholders, communities in tourist destinations. The data collection technique used in this research is through field observation, direct interviews with tourist destination managers and the community at tourist destinations, literature studies and documentation. The data analysis technique used in this research is  qualitative descriptive data analysis technique. Data is transcribed into a form that can be analyzed. Transcription can be done by writing down recorded interviews or observations. Next, compile the data code, namely giving labels or categories to the data that has been transcribed. Results and Discussion The Role of the Tourism Sector in the Bira Bulukumba Beach Area Tourism can play a very important role in improving the community's economy, especially in areas that have quite large tourism potential. Bulukumba Regency is one of the districts in South Sulawesi Province which has the most tourism potential such as culinary tourism, religious tourism, cultural and historical tourism as well as craft tourism, marine and island tourism, historical tourism/historic sites, traditional tourism, water bath/bathing tourism, nature tourism, agro tourism, culinary tourism and religious tourism. The development and development process of an area can be supported by its tourism potential (Khalid et al., 2019). The coastal area of Bontobahari District in Bulukumba Regency has very prominent tourism potential, because of this potential this district is being developed as a marine tourism attraction by the local government.    20 ISSN 2721-0987 (Print), ISSN 2721-124X (Online) Copyright © 2023, Journal La Bisecoman, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 In order to utilize the positive potential of tourism for the community's economy, sustainable and inclusive management is needed by involving local community participation in decision making and improving skills and the quality of tourism products and services. However, to optimally exploit the economic potential of tourism, it is important to ensure that the benefits from tourism are distributed fairly among communities, and to promote sustainable tourism practices to protect the environment and culture in the Bira Coast Region. Impact of the Tourism Sector in the Bira Bulukumba Beach Area The role and impact of tourism are interrelated but also have differences. The role relates to what the tourism industry plays in helping develop the economy of communities in tourist destinations. Meanwhile, the impact of tourism includes the real results arising from the existence of the tourism industry on the community's economy. The role of tourism can include job creation, increasing income, increasing economic growth, increasing economic sustainability, and promoting local culture (Manzoor et al., 2019). This is an effort or role played by related parties in the tourism industry to help develop the community's economy. The role of tourism refers more to the actions taken by the tourism industry to provide economic benefits to local communities. The impact of tourism includes concrete results from the tourism industry on the community's economy. The impact of tourism can be in the form of increasing people's income, increasing people's ability to access basic needs such as clean water, food and health services, as well as increasing people's ability to develop and improve local products and services. The impact of tourism refers more to the effects or consequences of the existence of the tourism industry on the economy of local communities (Uslu et al., 2020). Tourism has various impacts on the planet, both positive and negative. For example, the large amount of greenhouse gases produced when people use planes to go to various destinations. This certainly contributes to global warming and climate change. However, on the other hand, tourists also spend money in the destinations they visit, thereby helping to create jobs and stimulate the local economy. Apart from the positive impacts above, tourism also has negative impacts, including negative impacts on the community's economy, such as inflation and economic disparities between local communities and tourists. Therefore, it is important for the government and tourism stakeholders to pay attention to sustainability and fairness in tourism development to increase the positive benefits generated. Local Community Job Opportunities in the Tourism Sector in the Bira Bulukumba Beach Area Job opportunities in the tourism industry can provide significant economic benefits for local communities, especially in terms of increasing income and living standards. Therefore, the government and tourism stakeholders need to pay attention to the development of sectors related to tourism and provide appropriate training and education for local communities so that they can fill available job opportunities, including communities in the Bira Beach Area, Bulukumba Regency. However, job opportunities in the tourism industry in the industry are not always filled by local people. Often, workers in the tourism industry are filled by workers from outside the region and even from abroad. This also happened in the Bira Beach area, Bulukumba Regency. Therefore, it is important for governments and tourism stakeholders to promote and support local community participation in the tourism industry and ensure that policies are in place that enable fair and equal employment opportunities for all. Tourism destinations can be a potential source of significant employment opportunities for people in the Bira Beach Area.   21 ISSN 2721-0987 (Print), ISSN 2721-124X (Online) Copyright © 2023, Journal La Bisecoman, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 The Bulukumba Regency Government and tourism stakeholders in Bulukumba can help increase employment opportunities in Bulukumba Regency tourist destinations, especially in the Bira Beach Area, through developing skills training programs for the local community. This will help improve their skills and qualifications so they can compete in the job market with workers from outside Bulukumba Regency. Tourism destinations can provide many potential employment opportunities for local communities, especially in sectors related to the tourism industry. Economic Recovery Efforts Through Tourism in the Bira Bulukumba Beach Area Efforts to restore the economy through tourism in the Bira Beach Area cannot be separated from the efforts made by the regional government, in this case the Bulukumba Regency government and the South Sulawesi Provincial government through several recommendations provided. The recommendations for tourism recovery for South Sulawesi Province consider aspects of coordination and strategic planning. This is done because the provincial level policy making process involves many actors with all their complexity. Creating short-term plans for all tourism actors. The aim is for South Sulawesi tourism actors to be able to meet basic economic needs while providing facilities and direct assistance widely and evenly as needed as an urgent means of life support. Therefore, it is also necessary to coordinate data from the relevant agencies regarding who needs assistance, as well as what assistance is really needed. Improving the process, mechanism and quality of data collection related to the tourism sector. Data collection is very crucial in developing strategic plans and policies that are right on target and can be accounted for in the context of tourism recovery. Data-based policies need to be supported by all relevant parties. Carry out comprehensive coordination and apply firmness in the socialization and implementation of the Clean, Health, Safety and Environment (CHSE) protocol, especially for communities far from the provincial center. The goal is that tourism reactivation can run optimally. Carrying out measurable control functions for various provincial tourism development processes currently being carried out (for example infrastructure development in 2020, preparation for tourism activities in 2021, and so on). These things are part of the medium and long term efforts to restore the tourism economy in South Sulawesi. Coordinate with regional governments (city/district) and relevant regional apparatus organizations (OPD) regarding the provision of training (capacity building) for tourism actors, in accordance with the needs of the tourism actors themselves. This means that the capacity building program needs to be bottom up so that it is more effective and on target. Conduct literature reviews and measurable strategies regarding methods of increasing income from the tourism sector, even though it is predicted that the quantity of tourists, especially foreign tourists, will decrease in the next few years. Various studies on this matter have been published both nationally and internationally. So, tourism does not always have to depend on a large quantity of tourists for its income. Conclusion Efforts to restore the economy through tourism in the Bira Beach Area cannot be separated from the efforts made by the regional government, in this case the Bulukumba Regency government and the South Sulawesi Provincial government, through several recommendations given, including: creating short-term plans for all tourism actors, improving processes, mechanisms and quality of data collection related to the tourism sector, carrying out comprehensive coordination and applying firmness in the socialization and implementation of the Clean, Health, Safety and Environment (CHSE) protocol, especially for communities far from the provincial center, carrying out measurable control functions for various tourism   22 ISSN 2721-0987 (Print), ISSN 2721-124X (Online) Copyright © 2023, Journal La Bisecoman, Under the license CC BY-SA 4.0 development processes provinces that are currently being carried out (for example infrastructure development in 2020, preparation for tourism activities in 2021, 2022 and 2023, and so on), coordinating with regional governments (city/district) and related regional apparatus organizations (OPD) regarding the provision of training (capacity building). ) for tourism actors, in accordance with the needs of tourism actors themselves and conducting literature studies and measurable strategies regarding methods of increasing income from the tourism sector, even though it is predicted that the quantity of tourists, especially foreign tourists, will decrease in the next few years.
