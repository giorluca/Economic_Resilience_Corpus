Since many adaptation measures havethe feature of a local public good, and since benefits accrue to later generations mainly, most environmental economists would argue that thepublic goods issue is the most plausible reason why incentives are often insufficient for achieving the optimal level of adaptation. Within astylized overlapping generation model, we show that adaptation is subject to severe intergenerational consistency problems, if pureself-interest is a feature of the generation’s behavior. This explains among others why too little is invested into climate changeadaptation. We also show that if the distribution of income between generations matters or if generations behave altruistic, thisconsistency conflict can be solved and offers possibilities for policy intervention.Keywords: climate change adaptation policy, intergenerational fairness and equity1. IntroductionToday atmospheric carbon concentrations have already reachedlevels such that due to the inertia of the climate system globalwarming is unavoidable to some degree, even if emissions werecut back completely. This could, combined with a growingpopulation and inappropriate land use, lead to a significantincrease in the frequency, intensity, and the duration of weather-related extreme events such as floods (e.g. IPCC, 2014). Feyenet al. (2012), for example, estimate that in Europe the annualdamages caused by river flooding will more than triple till the endof the century. Based on recorded observations, the OcCC (1999)reports that in the Alps autumn and winter precipitation hasalready risen by more than 30% over the last 100 years.Furthermore, model-based predictions suggest that climaticwarming will cause significantly more and severe flood events inthe Swiss Central Plateau (Mittelland) and southern Switzerland,which could imply additional flood-related costs in the order ofmagnitude of several hundred million Swiss francs per year unlesseffective adaptation measures through flood protection are taken.Consequently, mitigation cannot be the only policy response tothe threat of global climate change. Alternatively, there exists thepossibility to reduce a region’s vulnerability by adapting toimpacts of global warming.1 Thereby, adaptation can cover a widerange of different measures, including early storm warning on theone end and investments in infrastructures such as dams forpreventing against flooding on the other. However, compared tothe projected needs, adaptation policies today are lagging behindsignificantly (see Rayner and Jordan, 2010). Environmentaleconomists typically argue that many adaptation measures such asflood protection have the feature of a local public good, and sinceboth the present and future generations will benefit from such aninvestment, this combined with the public goods issue is the mostmentioned reason why incentives are often deficient. A particularexample in this context is New Orleans, Louisiana (for a detaileddiscussion, see Wolfe, 2008). Its geography as well as its naturalenvironment allows for destructive hurricanes as the city’s historyhas demonstrated. A levee system was constructed in the 1940sfor providing protection to the city, but three subsequent hurricanestrikes indicated that New Orleans remained vulnerable toflooding. After each disaster, politicians promised to prevent asimilar catastrophe, and each time they failed to adequately fix thelevees. An assessment of the levee system through the WhiteHouse (2006) after Hurricane Katrina concluded: “New Orleanshas now been flooded by hurricanes six times over the pastcentury; in 1915, 1940, 1947, 1965, 1969, and 2005. It should notbe allowed to happen again” (White House, 2006).Political rhetoric, which promises that decisions taken in thepresent can positively affect the welfare of generations to come,sounds appealing. But as the example of New Orleansdemonstrates, political rhetoric frequently surpasses politicalaction. Levees may protect present-generation voters, but futuregenerations also can enjoy the benefit of a well-protected city thathas not suffered a catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina. That futuregenerations will benefit only if current generations pay is anexample of an intergenerational externality, which leads to anunderinvestment in disaster protection as economists argue. Andsince the unborn cannot vote in today’s elections, elected officials*Corresponding author: Gunter Stephan, Department of Economics andOeschger Center for Climate Change Research, University of Bern,Switzerland.

Many lawyers (e.g., see Frischmann, 2005, Mank,2009, or Wolfe, 2008) therefore argue that the American politicalinstitutions as well as the legal system do not adequately protectthe interests of future generations.A different explanation is given by historian. Pfister (2009) forexample argues that insufficient investment into climate changeadaptation is the result of what is termed “disaster gap.” Whilecommunities of Western and Central Europe for many centurieswere regularly hit by natural hazards and disasters, the evidenceof such events diminished over the late nineteenth and earlytwentieth century. For Switzerland, for example, the time series ofsevere disasters during the period between 1806 and 2007 showsthat recorded losses of life and damages were relativelyinfrequent. This “disaster gap” promoted the loss of what istermed “disaster memory,” and hence, the risk of natural hazardswas increasingly disregarded by societies.This paper provides an explanation by applying an economicperspective. Markets can under particular circumstances grantefficiency but are generally bad in granting equity, and marketoutcomes may have undesirable distributional implications. Inparticular, intergenerational conflicts will not be solved in a perfectmarket economy. However, since the pioneering work of Güthet al. (1982) we know in particular that fairness considerations playa key role in the allocation of resources. Using insight frombehavioral economics as established by Neilson (2006) as well asFehr and Schmidt (2003) (for an overview, see Johansson-Stenmann and Konow, 2009), we argue that the issue ofintergenerational fairness can explain, why in the past much toolittle was invested into climate change adaptation.2 For example, ifin the present the costs of adaptation exceed the benefits, thepresent generation has only little motivation for investing intoadaptation, unless the future generation commits herself tocompensate the present one for their adaptation expenditure. Butwhy should the young generation donate something to the old oneonce the adaptation measure is implemented? This inconsistencyphenomenon might explain why in many cases today too little isinvested into public adaptation projects.Section 2 presents an economic analysis based on a stylizedmodel of overlapping generations with adaptation and discussesthree stages of the world: first, where generations are motivatedby self-interest only, second, in which intergenerational fairnessconsiderations matter, and third, where the generations’ behavioris characterized by altruism. It is shown that if generations decidesolely in their own self-interest, too little will be invested intoadaptation, while in a world, where intergenerational fairnessmatters, more will be invested into adaptation.2. ModelSince the major purpose of this exercise is to provide insidefrom an economic perspective, ideas are presented in a simpleway, by using a “stylized facts” model, which is deliberatelysimple, but general enough to convoy the central messages. Timeis taken as discrete and agents are represented by a sequence ofoverlapping age cohorts. Each generation lives for two periods,the working period and retirement, and will be indexed by thedate at which they enter the working period. Let y1t denote conven-tional income of generation t, which in period t is in its first period oflifetime. y2t denotes the income of generation t during retirement,which is its second period of life time. Note that for sake of simplicityincome is taken as exogenously given.Among the various greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) isthe most relevant one and global climate change is directly attributedto cumulative CO2-emissions. With the particular form of a publicgood model adopted here, global climate change affects incomerather than utility. Consequently, depending on the stock Qt ofatmospheric carbon dioxide only a fraction ;t of conventionalincome is at the generations’ disposal for consumption. This meansthat economic costs of climate change are measured in terms offorgone conventional income due to global warming. The effectsof global climate change on regional economies, however, can bemoderated by investing into adaptation.Adaptation comprises a variety of different measures, which aredesigned for improving the adaptive capacity of a society. Examplesare investments into protection infrastructures such as dikes, earlywarning systems, or a change of urban architecture and buildingstandards. But adaptation also includes changes in crops, seating,and harvesting times. To allow for such a heterogeneity,adaptation here is represented through expenditure. Therefore, theclimate impact function3 ;t Qt ; atð Þ, which expresses the fractionof conventional income that still is at the societies’ disposal, is aconcave function of the region’s expenditure at for adapting to cli-mate change as well as of the CO2 concentration Qt . This means, thehigher the stock of globally accumulated greenhouse gas emissionsand the less is invested into adaptation, the lower will be the fractionof income, which is at disposal for consumption. Or to phrase itdifferently, the more is invested into adaptation, the higher is thefraction of income at disposal, that is,@;t=@at > 0with @2;t=@a2t < 0:2.1. Self-interest onlyNow, consider two adjunct generations t, t þ 1, and suppose thatif at the beginning of period t the decision is made to invest into adap-tation, climate protection will become effective from period t þ 1onwards. Let at denote the investment expenditure and letθ Qtþ1; atð Þ be the remaining climate impact if at was invested intoadaptation in period t.4 If r denotes the market rate of interest, thepresent value5 of green lifetime net income of generation t is given bygyt ¼ y1t  at þ ð1þ rÞ1 θ Qtþ1; atð Þy2tð Þ: (1)Obviously, generation twill invest at into adaptation, if the green netpresent value of lifetime income gyt with adaptation investments areat least as great as income without investments, that is,gyt  y1t þ ð1þ rÞ1 θ Qtþ1; 0ð Þy2tð Þ:Generation t þ 1 has the option to also invest into adaptation andhence has the green lifetime net income2Note that we focus on issue of intergenerational equity by neglecting the importantissue of intragenerational equity. Hoel et al. (2019) published a paper that deals with bothaspects in case of mitigation, however.3An example of a climate impact factor, which typically is used in integrated assessmentanalysis, is given by Manne et al. (1995) or Stephan and Müller-Fürstenberger (1998).Moreover, this function includes damages caused by flooding as special case, asBosello et al. (2009) as well as Hoffmann and Stephan (2018) discuss in detail.4For focusing on intergenerational fairness, let us sidestep the issue of uncertainty, byassuming that climate impacts are known for sure.5Itmust be noted that using themarket rate of interest for calculating present values impliesa particular choice of a discount rate. The discount rate greatly affects the policy decision aswas intensively discussed in the literature. For an example, see Arrow et al. (2013).Green and Low-Carbon Economy Vol. 1 Iss. 3 2023106gytþ1 ¼ θ Qtþ1;at y1tþ1  atþ1þ ð1þ rÞ1 θ Qtþ1; at þ atþ1ð Þy2tþ1 : (2)Hence, since @;=@at > 0, investing into adaptation by generationt generates a positive external effect. Furthermore, by taking the totaldifferential of (2) we getdatþ1dat¼ @;=@aty1tþ1 þ ð1þ rÞ1@;=@aty2tþ1ð1þ rÞ1@;=@atþ1y2tþ1  1< 0;which is negative, since generation t+ 1 will invest additionally intoadaptation only, ifð1þ rÞ1@;=@atþ1y2tþ1  1 > 0:This implies that themore the old generation has invested into adaptation,the lower are the optimal investments of the young generation.Economic analysis usually employs the self-interest hypothesis,which means that actors are exclusively motivated by their materialself-interest and do not consider the interests of the other agents whenmaking decisions (see Fehr and Schmidt 2003). If we apply thisassumption, this implies that generation t will invest only (see (1)), ifð1þ rÞ1 θ Qtþ1; atð Þy2t  θ Qtþ1; 0ð Þy2tð Þð Þ  at : (3)Now suppose, however, that condition (3) does not hold true. Thengiven the structure of the problem, generation t has no incentive toinvest into adaptation, unless generation t þ 1 is committed to transferincome. However, generation t þ 1 has no incentive to do so, sinceonce it has to make its transfer decision the adaptation investment isalready executed. Generation t anticipates this, and thus there willbe a Pareto-inefficient outcome, where no investment takes place.Alternatively, one could argue, generation t invests into adap-tation as long as marginal income effects of investing into adaptationare non-negative, that is, @gyt=@at  0 or1þ rð Þ  @;t=@at y2t½ ; (3a)which follows from condition (1).6 There are two messages fromcondition (3a). First, an additional dollar will be spent foradaptation only, if the net return of this investment, and henceprevented damages @;t=@at y2t½ , is at least as high as the net returnfrom investing this dollar in the stock market. Second, conventionalwealth matters. The higher the generation t’s conventional income,the more will be invested into adaptation. As an outcome, this is con-sistent with the so-called Shelling conjecture (see Anthoff and Tol,2011), but the reasoning is quite different. The Shelling conjecturesays that highly developed, richer societies are less vulnerable, sincethey own the resources to invest into adaptation, while here net ben-efits of investing into adaptation simply exceed gains from saving.2.2. Pareto improvements through transfersEven if condition (3a) is satisfied, adaptation investment willnot be Pareto-efficient. For Pareto efficiency requires that thewelfare of both generations is maximized simultaneously, whichleads to the following necessary condition of optimality:1þ rð Þ ¼ @;t=@at y2t½  þ @;tþ1=@at y2tþ1 þ 1 þ rð Þ @;t=@at y1tþ1 :(4)where at denotes the Pareto efficient level of adaptation expenditure.This means that1þ rð Þ > @;t=@at y2t½ ;hence see condition (3a)@;t=@at > @;t=@atWhich, because of concavity of the climate impactfunction ;t Qt ; atð Þ, implies at > at higher investment comparedto the case of pure self-interest.The analysis so far is closely related to the one on fundamentalstandards and time consistency (see Konrad and Thum, 1993). Aswell as the work of Hoel et al (2019).7 It reveals that in theabsence of binding contracts the asymmetry of the distribution ofcosts and benefits of climate change adaptation will lead to aninefficient outcome as well as governmental failure in thefollowing sense. Suppose there are two sovereign governments –one elected by the parents’ generation and one by thedescendants’ generation. For internalizing the external effects ofinvesting into adaptation, these governments have to write acontract, which foresees the investment into adaptation measuresby the old generation on the one side and transfers from theyoung to the old on the other. But, once the adaptation measure isimplemented, the descendants’ government has an incentive todeviate unless institutions exist, which can enforce the contract.Indeed, it is easy to show that intergenerational cooperation, forexample, through transfer from the young to the old generation givesroom for Pareto improvements. To see that suppose transfers T fromthe young generation is completely used for adaption investment. Thengyt Tð Þ ¼ y1t  at þ ð1þ rÞ1 θ Qtþ1; at1 þ Tð Þy2tð Þ (1a)Is the net lifetime income of generation t, which will raise, since@;t=@at > 0.

Fairness considerationsHow do fairness considerations change the analysis? To answerthis question, let us use the approach proposed by Johansson-Stenmann and Konow (2009). Now suppose that the welfare Utof generation t does not only depend on own lifetime income gytbut also on the judgement of the distribution of income f t across gen-erations, which in turn depends on expected lifetime income, that is,Ut ¼ gyt þ f t gyt ; gytþ1ð Þ: (5)6Note that a necessary condition for optimal adaptation investmentis 1þ rð Þ ¼ @;t=@at y2t½ :7Hoel et al. (2019) consider mitigation and explore the idea that there is potentiallysome Pareto-inefficiency, due to missing options for intergenerational transfers.Green and Low-Carbon Economy Vol. 1 Iss. 3 2023107Since green net income of both generations depends onadaptation investments at , utilities also depend on these, that is,@Ut@at¼ @gyt@atþ @ft@gyt@gyt@atþ @ft@gytþ1@gytþ1@at : (6)The first expression on the right side indicates how utilities ofgeneration t are affected through adaptation investments via changesin the generation’s own green lifetime income. The second term showsthe impact of fairness perception on the generation’s welfare. The sizeof this effect depends on income effects on the one hand as well as byhowmuch the fairness perception is affected by small income changes@f t /@gyk, k ¼ t; t þ 1, on the other. Rearranging condition (6) gives@Ut@at¼ @gyt@at1þ @ft@gyt þ @ft@gytþ1@gytþ1@at ;which means even if the effect of adaptation on a generation’slifetime income is negative (i.e., @gyt@at < 0), it nevertheless couldpay to invest into adaptation measures because of distributionaleffects. For providing a simple example, let us apply the utility func-tion as has been established by Neilson (2006). Taken up for a twogenerations’ case, the utility function is8Ut ¼ gyt  α gyt  gytþ1ð Þ withα > 0: (5a)In words, this means: if compared to the future generation the presentone is wealthier in terms of green net income, this negatively affectsthe welfare of the present generation.From (5a), we observe@Ut@at¼ @gyt@at1 αð Þ þ α @gytþ1@at :Hence, compared to the case of pure self-interest, this implies that alower weight now is placed on changes of own green income, but apositive weight is put on the welfare effects of adaptation of the nextgeneration. Therefore, since @gytþ1@at > 0 by definition, the impact ofadaptation on welfare of generation t, @Ut@at, could be positive, evenif the effect on own net lifetime income @gyt@at is negative, providedthe fairness perception, that is, α, is high enough.2.4. Altruism and bequestGraham et al. (2017) show in an empirical study for the UK thatfor protecting against floods, the majority of voters selects policies,which bring equal or greater benefits to future generations. Only aminority selected a policy that most benefited their generation.Obviously, the behavior of the majority is characterized by altruism.Therefore, let us consider, how altruism affects adaptationdecisions. Altruism in its most simple version means that parentscare about the welfare of their children. Since welfare depends onincome, there are two ways of affecting the welfare of the futuregeneration, through investing into adaptation on the one hand andthrough bequest on the other. Let B denote the amount of incomethat is transferred, then one-sided intergenerational altruism changesthe analysis as follows. Generation t now maximizes the present valueof its own green income plus that of the income of the future gener-ation. If Wtþ1 denotes the utility of generation t+ 1, which dependson green net income gytþ1 and bequest B this means:Y1t  at  Bþ ð1þ rÞ1 θ atð Þy2tð ÞþWtþ1 θ atð Þy1tþ1 þ B atþ1 þ ð1þ rÞ1 θ atð Þy2tþ1  :By taking the partial differential with respect to at, the followingnecessary condition is observed:1þ rð Þ ¼ θ0 atð Þ y2t½ ð Þþ dWtþ1=dgytþ1 1þ rð Þθ0 atð Þy1tþ1 þ θ0 atð Þy2tþ1  : (7)which is a Solow–Stiglitz type of a condition. It says that in optimumgeneration t is indifferent between investing one unit of income into thefinancial market, which yields the income of 1þ rð Þ or investing intoadaptation, which generates marginal benefits as shown in the rightside of equation (7). In other words, in optimum generation t is indif-ferent between investing into adaptation or into the financial market.Furthermore, there is interaction between bequests andadaptation investment. By taking the total differential, we getdBdat¼ @gyt=@at þdWtþ1dgytþ1@gytþ1=@atdWtþ1dgytþ1 1< 0which is negative, since there will be adaptation investment only if thenumerator is non-negative and there will be bequest only, ifdWtþ1/@gytþ1  1. This condition allows for two interpretations. First,if the old generation decides to invest into adaptation from which theyoung can profit, at the same time it decides to reduce bequests. Andsecond, if bequest is reduced, then this loss in money transfer will becompensated through investing into adaptation. This motivates a policyintervention. Taxing bequest would rise the incentive to invest intoadaptation.3. ConclusionsBoth in developing and in developed countries, the impact ofglobal climate change is visible and tangible already. Nevertheless,investment in adaptation measures is far too low. Economisttypically argues that this results from the fact that most adaptationmeasures have the features of a local public good. An alternativeexplanation, provided by lawyers mainly, is that the existingdemocratic institutions as well as legal regulations do not protectthe interest of coming generations sufficiently (see Bertram, 2023).We argue, however, that adaptation suffers, like mitigation, fromsevere time consistency problems. Since cost and benefits accrue atdifferent points in time, this raises the question of intergenerationaljustice as political scientists point out (Page, 1999). With respect toour analysis, there is an important caveat, however. Our analysis isbased on economic reasoning only and exhibits within a stylizedoverlapping generations model two major insights:(1) In case of pure self-interest and without binding contracts, theasymmetry between the dates when costs and benefits of climatechange adaptation materialize will lead to an inefficient outcome aswell as governmental failure. The present generation invests inadaptation only if their own benefits of adaptation cover their costs.If this condition is not fulfilled, the future generation would have to8Note, this example is a simplified version of preferences for fairness as developed byFehr and Schmidt (2003). In a two person case, this type of an utility function has theform Ut ¼ gyt  αmax gyt  gytþ1 ; 0ð Þ  βmax gytþ1  gyt ; 0ð Þ; with α ≥ β > 0. Theparameter β represents the disutility from allocations that are disadvantageously unequalfor generation t due to envy about generation t þ 1’s higher payoff, while the parameterα captures the disutility from allocations that are advantageously unequal for generationt due to guilt over earning a higher payoff than generation t þ 1: Note that this kind ofan utility function can explain voluntary contributions in public good games and costlypunishment of free-riders (see Fehr and Schmidt, 2003)Green and Low-Carbon Economy Vol. 1 Iss. 3 2023108commit herself to compensate the present one for parts of theiradaptation expenditure. However, any promise made by the younggeneration is not reliable, since there is no need to donate to theold generation once the adaptation measure is implemented.(2) Graham et al. (2017) show in an empirical study for the UK thatfor both saving lives and protecting against floods the majority ofvoters selects policies, which bring equal or greater benefits tofuture generations. Only a minority selected a policy that mostbenefited their generation. Obviously, this study raisesquestions about a core assumption of standard economicevaluation, pointing instead to concern for future generations asa value that many people hold in common.Who benefits andwho pays for adaptation are important intrinsically. Butit is also important because if the burden of adaptation is perceived to beunfair, then action will not be legitimized, and interventions simply willnot happen (see Davies, 2020). As our analysis reveals fairnessconsiderations and altruism could indeed help to overcome the timeconsistency problem of adaptation. If the distribution of incomebetween generations matters from the present generation’s perspectiveand if the fairness perception is high enough, the impact of adaptationon welfare of these generation could be positive, although the effecton own net lifetime income may be negative. In other words, aresponsible style of life pays off compared to a purely self-interest-oriented lifestyle. For in case of altruistic behavior, where eachgeneration cares for the welfare of its subsequent generation byinvesting into either adaptation or conventional capital formation, inthe resulting optimum more will be invested into adaptation.Conflicts of InterestThe author declares that he has no conflicts of interest tothis work.ReferencesAnthoff, D., & Tol, R.
