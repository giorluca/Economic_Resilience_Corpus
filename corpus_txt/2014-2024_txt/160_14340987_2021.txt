The financial crisis has brought to light the heterogeneity of the economic responsiveness of locations to the crisis as much in Europe as in the US. Since the Great Recession, many papers and books have been published (amongst others: Christopherson et al., 2010; Martin, 2012; Boschma, 2015; Kahl and Hundt, 2015; Bristow and Healy, 2018a) and Special Issues released in scientific journals such as the Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society (2010), Raumforschung und Raumordnung (2014) or in The Annals of Regional Science (2018). Moreover, the term resilience has been picked up by international economic organisations. The concept was mentioned in the 2017-2018 Global Competitiveness Review (WEF, 2018) and by the IMF (2019). In 2020, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has published a ranking of the most resilient countries (WEF, 2020). These examples are only a glimpse at the increasing popularity of the concept in the scientific community.  A decade after the Great Recession, a wave of works on the concept of economic resilience has emerged, building on the increased availability of data and focusing on the determinants affecting the resilience of locations (Bristow and Healy, 2018b). While the determinants driving the growth process of economies have been extensively studied, there are still ongoing questions as to whether these drivers also impact economic resilience (Rocchetta and Mina, 2019, p. 1430). For example, in their book Economic Crisis and the Resilience of Regions, Bristow and Healy (2018a, p. 1) ask: “What is it that makes some economies more resilient to economic shocks than others?”. This question gives rise to more: What does economic resilience mean? What are the most Introduction  2 important determinants characterising resilient economies? Di Caro and Fratesi (2018, p. 235) observe that an open issue in the literature is the identification of the drivers, or so-called determinants, affecting economic resilience. Similarly to the study of economic growth, understanding the economic resilience of locations may have critical importance in regard to economic policy. In fact, implementing the right policies may help mitigate the effect of shocks and increase the well-being of economic agents. Sensier (2018, pp. 11-12) argues that there is “a social value as there is a tendency in the minds of the public and politicians to regard the possession of a job as a strong indication of the well-being of an economy”. Therefore, not only growth matters, but also how to reduce the volatility of an economy regarding “both economy-wide and industry specific shocks” (Delgado and Porter, 2018, p. 1)  In this thesis, an investigation of the concept of economic resilience will be carried out by looking at clusters and the impact that they may have on economic resilience. During a presentation at the Microeconomics of Competitiveness (MOC) Faculty Workshop on December 2018, Michael Porter stressed the importance of the depth and breadth of clusters in developing economic resilience (Porter, 2018). Many studies have shown that clusters increase the performance of firms in terms of productivity and growth (amongst others: Porter, 2003; Delgado et al., 2010; Delgado et al., 2014; Resbeut and Gugler, 2016). In other words, clusters increase the competitiveness and prosperity of the locations that host them. In fact, prosperity is created by the activities of firms and depends on the firms’ ability to increase productivity (Gugler, 2019, p. 18). In turn, firms are influenced by the surrounding economic environment and the competitive advantages of locations. Hence, the economic environment around clusters may also be of importance regarding the economic resilience of locations. However, few studies have focused on the impact of these clusters when the economic situation is declining.  Do clusters increase the economic resilience of locations in times of crisis and consequently strengthen their prosperity even more? This would contradict the popular belief that you should not put all your eggs in one basket. In economic terms, if a location is specialised in one cluster, does it weaken the competitiveness and reduce the prosperity of that location in times of economic downturn? And does a location hosting a larger array of clusters perform better in the face of an external shock? Or is it the co-location of related clusters that could play a positive role on economic resilience?  Introduction  3 In fact, recent works have found diverging results regarding the influence of the ‘industrial mix’ on the resilience of locations. While some studies stress the importance of specialisation (Brakman et al., 2014; Cuadrado-Roura and Maroto, 2016), related diversity (Hane-Weijman et al., 2017; Pudelko and Hundt, 2017), clusters (Kahl and Hundt, 2015; Wrobel, 2015) or of the co-location of related clusters (Delgado and Porter, 2018), others have highlighted the fact that it is the diversity of a location’s economic structure that increase resilience (Brown and Greenbaum, 2016; Sagan and Masik, 2018; Cainelli et al., 2019). This may rise the question of what types of agglomeration increase economic resilience? Other works highlight the role of innovation (Clark et al., 2010; Hannigan et al., 2015), the regional and national context (Fratesi and Perucca, 2018; Sondermann, 2018), entrepreneurship (Hundt and Sternberg, 2014; Huggins and Thompson, 2015; Sagan and Masik, 2018; Bishop, 2019) or the quality of human capital (Glaeser et al., 2014; Diodato and Weterings, 2015; Weinstein and Patrick, 2019) to explain the economic resilience of locations. By focusing on clusters and their underlying mechanisms as drivers of prosperity, this investigation may give more fruitful insight about the determinants of economic resilience and offer a new dimension on the competitiveness and prosperity of locations. In fact, the concept of competitiveness is well established in the economic literature and has been addressed since many centuries by policy makers in order to “understand the drivers of economic prosperity and social welfare” (Gugler, 2019, p. 18). Hence, the aim of this thesis is to investigate more thoroughly the influence of clusters on the economic resilience of locations from a conceptual standpoint and understand if they influence the economic resilience of locations.  In this regard, while the theories on the competitiveness and prosperity of locations are well established, the theory around economic resilience has not yet reached a general understanding. Hence, there are two key aspects to be elucidated: (1) how resilience can be analysed in the economic context, (2) and what determinants influence economic resilience. The methodology applied in this thesis is based on the complex literature review (Machi and McEvoy, 2016, p.3). The goal of a complex literature review is to perform a review of the literature as a basis for arguing a case and identifying further research problems. In Introduction  4 this thesis, the idea is to use the current knowledge about two subjects: economic resilience and clusters. By crossing two different concepts, it defines an issue for further analysis by providing a case for argumentation with a solid theoretical background. Figure 0.1 presents the methodological path taken in this thesis following the complex literature review. The point of departure is the literature reviews on the concepts of economic resilience and clusters that are performed in chapters 1 and 2, respectively. Then, based on the conclusions of these two literature reviews, it was found that a further investigation of the theories of growth and business cycles, in regard to the concepts of economic resilience and clusters, was needed in order to understand if clusters can influence economic resilience. These two supplementary literature reviews are tackled in chapter 3 and 4, respectively. Finally, by putting together the conclusions of the four literature reviews carried out, the determinants and mechanisms through which clusters influence economic resilience are identified.

The first one presents the microeconomics of competitiveness (MOC) framework which encompasses the concept of clusters in order to understand how clusters influence the prosperity of locations. The second chapter investigates the literature on economic resilience and introduces conceptual issues as well as potential determinants. Based on the conclusions of chapters 1 and 2, growth theories and business cycle theories are investigated in chapters 3 and 4, respectively. The growth and business cycle theories analysed are selected based on the determinants found in the first and second chapters. Building on the conclusions of chapters 1 to 4, the final analysis is conducted in the fifth chapter. It presents the determinants and mechanisms of clusters that influence the economic resilience of locations.      6 Chapter 1 1 The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective The aim of this chapter is to understand how clusters affect the prosperity of locations from a theoretical and empirical point of view. It will lay grounds for the analysis carried out in the following chapters to determine whether clusters can play a role in increasing the economic resilience of locations. In this chapter, the underlying mechanisms and determinants of clusters affecting the prosperity of locations are identified. This chapter is structured as follows. The microeconomics of competitiveness framework, of which the concept of clusters is a part, is presented in section 1.1 from a theoretical standpoint. In section 1.2, an examination of the literature is conducted focusing on works that have statistically and empirically analysed the influence of clusters, and their underlying mechanisms and determinants, on the prosperity of locations. Finally, there is a synthesis in section 1.3, identifying the determinants affecting the prosperity of location.   1.1 The concept of clusters from a Porterian approach: A theoretical examination This first section presents the theoretical basis for identifying the determinants of clusters that affect the prosperity of locations. Michael. E. Porter introduces his understanding of the concept of clusters in a first book published in 1990, The Competitive Advantage of Nations, and continues the analysis in various articles (Porter, 1998; Porter, 2000; Porter, Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  7 2003; Porter, 2009; Delgado et al., 2010; Delgado et al. 2014) as well as in a second book published in 2008, On Competition.  The concept of clusters per se was not introduced by Porter. In fact, theoretical antecedents of clusters can be found in the literature, notably in economic geography. Authors such as Marshall, Krugman and Glaeser have also investigated concepts close to the one proposed by Porter, whether it is industrial districts, external economies or agglomeration forces. The theoretical antecedents of cluster are the focus of subsection 1.1.3. Nevertheless, this thesis will build on Porter’s understanding of clusters.  The concept of clusters falls within the microeconomics of competitiveness framework and represents one of the drivers of the prosperity of locations. The prosperity of locations depends on the firms’ activities and more precisely on their productivity, with which factors of production are employed and upgraded over time (Gugler, 2019, pp. 18-20). The prosperity of a location is based on three levels of drivers as showed in figure 1.1: the endowments of a location, the macroeconomic competitiveness level and the microeconomic competitiveness level. While the endowments “create a foundation for prosperity” and the macroeconomic competitiveness level “sets the potential for high productivity”, prosperity ultimately depends on the productivity with which the “human, capital and natural endowments are used” (ISC, 2020). Hence, productivity is created at the microeconomic competitiveness level and depends on “improving the microeconomic capability of the economy and the sophistication of local competition” (ISC, 2020).  Endowments can be natural resources (e.g. oil, minerals), a given geographic location (e.g. a port situated on an important trade route) or the size of a location (e.g. in terms of population). Macroeconomic competitiveness encompasses sound monetary and fiscal policies (i.a. low level of inflation) as well as effective institutions and higher human development levels (i.a. basic education and health care, rule of law, stable political and governmental organisations) (ISC, 2020). While endowments and macroeconomic competitiveness provide the foundation and potential for prosperity, they are not sufficient. It is at the microeconomic level that productivity and, in fine, prosperity are created. The microeconomic level is composed of three dimensions: (1) the quality of the business environment which can be analysed through the lens of the “diamond” model, (2) the Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  8 state of cluster development, and (3) the sophistication of company operations and strategy, namely the skills, capabilities and strategies adopted by firms (see figure 1.1) (ISC, 2020). Hence, it is the microeconomic competitiveness level which is of importance in this thesis, and in particular the state of cluster development.  Consequently, this first section is structured as follows: subsection 1.1.1 focuses on the microeconomic business environment, subsection 1.1.2 analyses the role played by firms, and the concept of clusters is developed in subsection 1.1.3.  Figure 1.1: Drivers of the prosperity of locations.  Source: Personal elaboration based on ISC (2020) and Ketels (2016, p. 14).  1.1.1 Quality of the business environment Porter’s aim is to understand, from a microeconomic perspective, how industries are able to create and sustain a competitive advantage. He notably asks:  Why are certain companies based in certain nations capable of consistent innovation? Why do they ruthlessly pursue improvements, seeking an ever more sophisticated source of competitive advantage? Why are they able to overcome the Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  9 substantial barriers to change and innovation that so often accompany success? (Porter, 2008, p. 182) Therefore, this subsection focuses on how the quality of the business environment impacts the firms’ capacity to create and sustain competitive advantages.  i From absolute and comparative advantage to competitive advantage Firstly, it is important to distinguish competitive advantages with the more traditional absolute advantages and comparative advantages introduced by Smith and Ricardo, respectively. In his book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, Adam Smith advances a notion that is known nowadays as “absolute advantage”, where each country exports a good if it can produce it at lower cost. In fact, Smith (1776, p. 457) writes:  If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry employed in a way in which we have some advantage. Hence, a country will be “left to find out the way in which it can be employed with the greatest advantage” and this is the case when “directed towards an object which it can buy cheaper than it can make” (Smith, 1776, p. 457). Consequently, a country will only produce a good for which it has an absolute cost advantage.  In Ricardo’s vision, explained in his book Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, published in 1817, comparative advantages arise, under the assumption of perfectly free commerce, when “each country naturally devotes its capital and labour to such employments as are most beneficial to each” (Ricardo, 1817a, p. 152). Put differently, each country specialises in the production of goods for which the factors of production are used “most effectively and most economically” (Ricardo, 1817a, p. 152). Hence, Ricardo advances the hypothesis of differences in productivity of factors of production. This induces an opportunity cost in producing a given good that is different in each country depending on “the peculiar powers bestowed by nature” (Ricardo, 1817a, p. 152). Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  10 Hence, a country has a comparative advantage in the production of a given good if its opportunity cost is lower than that of other countries (Krugman and Obstfeld, 2009, p. 29). This notion of comparative advantage has been the prevailing version in later economic theories.  While in Smith’s view it is the country that can offer the good at the lower cost that gains an advantage, Ricardo further improves this explanation by arguing that countries produce the goods for which they are most productive. Hence, a country may have an absolute advantage in the production of a given good but will produce another good for which the opportunity cost is lower. Or in other words, a country without an absolute advantage may still have an interest in trade as its opportunity cost to produce a given good may be lower than in other countries. Porter’s idea of competitive advantage diverges slightly from the notion of comparative advantage. In fact, in Porter’s view, comparative advantage based on differences in factors of production is not sufficient to explain trade, notably as it is based on strong hypotheses (i.a. no economies of scale, uniform technology) (Porter, 1990, p. 12). Consequently, comparative advantages do not explain actual patterns of trade since they do not take into account differences in the use of advanced technologies or specialised factors of productions (Porter, 1990, pp. 12-13). Also, change in technology and specialised factors of production is continuous and differs widely between locations.  Consequently, Porter (1990) proposes a new paradigm of a dynamic notion of competitive advantage based on a “highly localized process” that permits understanding of how firms achieve international success. It takes into account differences in “national structures, values, cultures, institutions and histories” that constantly evolve (Porter, 1990, p. 19). Hence, a notion of competitive advantage should: (1) encompass “segmented markets, differentiated products, technology differences, and economies of scale”, (2) be “dynamic and evolving”, (3) make “improvement and innovation in methods and technology a central element”, and (4) include the role played by firms in creating competitive advantages (Porter, 1990, pp. 20-21).  Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  11 ii The diamond framework: Explaining the business environment Firms create and sustain competitive advantages through a “highly localized process”, hence highlighting the role of the microeconomic business environment. For Porter (2008, p. 182), the explanation lies in the so-called ‘diamond’ of national advantage which represents the ‘four broad attributes’ (i.e. determinants) of a nation that affect the international competitive success of firms (see figure 1.2). Each point of the diamond represents one “broad attribute” and they are linked to one another and interact. Porter (2008, p. 199) adds that: “the diamond creates an environment that promotes clusters of competitive industries”. Hence, the ‘diamond’ represents a dynamic explanation of the international success of nations and helps understand the microeconomic environment that surrounds the creation of competitive industries as well as the formation of clusters (Porter, 2008, p. 199).  Porter (1990, p. 131; 2008, p. 198) also puts forward two essential ingredients in shaping the diamond into a system: (1) domestic rivalry, and (2) geographic concentration. While domestic rivalry “promotes improvement in all other determinants”, geographic concentration increases the interactions amongst the determinants (Porter, 2008, p. 198).  Figure 1.2: The diamond model representing the determinants of national advantage.  Source: Personal elaboration based on Porter (1990, p. 72).  Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  12 The self-reinforcing process of the determinants Each point of the diamond is influenced by the other points which consequently stimulate the competitive advantage of firms and, ultimately, of industries. Hence, the influence that the four determinants exert on each other are explained. The impact on factor creation is analysed first. Generalised factors are necessary but not sufficient for creating a competitive advantage (Porter, 1990, p. 132). In fact, these generalised factors are necessary for creating advanced and specialised factors which competitive industries need such as skilled labour, specific infrastructure or scientific knowledge in a particular domain. According to Porter (1990, p. 134), these advanced and specialised factors are primarily influenced by domestic rivalry. The strong competition between a certain number of local firms not only increases the investment made by firms in specialised factors but it also sets in motion specific programs in universities and government or private institutes for example, as well as activities including tailored training and apprenticeship programmes. The strong competition in a specific industry alerts public- and private-sector actors to potential needs in terms of factors of production, consequently reducing the risk for the competing firms of investing in the creation of these specific factors of production (Porter, 1990, p. 134). Related and supporting industries as well as demand conditions also amplify the creation of factors. In fact, some related and supporting industries (i.a. suppliers, service providers) may require similar advanced and specialised factors, which increases their demand and supply (Porter, 1990, p. 135). Demand conditions also influence factor creation when there is a “disproportionate” amount of demand for a specific good. In this case, the demand will “channel” investments that will satisfy the demand and create, over time, pools of specialised factors (Porter, 1990, pp. 135-136).  Demand conditions are also influenced by the other points of the diamond, and particularly by domestic rivalry. In fact, strong competition results, among other things, in aggressive pricing, greater variety and earlier launching of products (Porter, 1990, pp. 136-137). Further, domestic rivalry also raises awareness of the industry: local buyers are becoming more sophisticated and foreign buyers get word of the industry, thereby increasing foreign demand (Porter, 1990, p. 137). Regarding increasing foreign demand, Porter (1990, p. 137) specifies that strong domestic rivalry “builds a national image” and Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  13 reduces buyer’s risk thanks to the availability of numerous suppliers. This national image may also be the result of the reputation of related and supporting industries. Less important, in comparison to the other two broad attributes of the diamond, is the role of factor conditions on the internationalisation of home demand. Nonetheless, Porter (1990, p. 138) argues that sophisticated factors attract foreign firms which helps spread home demand.  Domestic rivalry is also the most important determinant influencing related and supporting industries. In fact, an internationally successful industry also increases the demand for tailored services that can be provided by suppliers (Porter, 1990, pp. 138-139). Due to the strong competition in the internationally successful industry, suppliers must innovate in order to satisfy their customers who face strong competition. The large presence of customers not only weakens the bargaining power of suppliers, but it also reduces their risk as they face a larger market. Consequently, increased investment and specialisation amongst the suppliers leads to more “potential centers of development” (Porter, 1990, p. 140). This, in turn, widens sales possibilities and reduces the risk for the suppliers.  Factor conditions also influence supporting industries through spillovers and synergies in terms of, inter alia, common technologies, skills and knowledge (Porter, 1990, p. 138). Similarly to the elements above regarding the influence of domestic rivalry, the suppliers may benefit from the advanced factor-creation mechanisms triggered by an internationally successful industry. Finally, the bigger the home demand, the more specialised the supporting industries. This is the consequence of economies of scale which increase the efficiency of suppliers (Porter, 1990, p. 138). Finally, while domestic rivalry has the strongest influence on each of the other points of the diamond, it can also be affected in various ways. Related and supporting industries stimulate firm creation. In fact, firms active in related or supporting industries may enter the base industry (Porter, 1990, p. 140). They not only have lower barriers to entry as some advanced factors of production may share strong similarities but they also bring new technologies and resources that may reshape the competition. Consequently, it preserves incentives for new innovations and sustains the competitive advantage. This process is called related diversification and it mostly takes place when the industry is Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  14 saturated or in decline (Porter, 1990, p. 142). Nonetheless, according to Porter (1990, p. 143), competitive advantage is the most “vibrant” when different related or supporting industries converge towards a new industry. In this scenario, a variety of “approaches to competing” and advanced factors are brought together (Porter, 1990, p. 143).  Sophisticated buyers (i.e. demand conditions) also increase domestic rivalry. They seek multiple sources of supply and therefore encourage new entries (Porter, 1990, p. 141). To a certain extent, buyers may also enter the industry and bring an “acute understanding of the buyer needs”, which enhances the competitive advantage. Finally, advanced factor creation mechanisms also provoke new entries, for example, when workers with specific training and skills decide to enter the industry as entrepreneurs. Usually, they are well informed about opportunities, technologies and market conditions. Overall, a strengthening of domestic rivalry, mostly through new entrants, increase the competition in an industry. This increased competition, in turn, will affect the other points of the diamond through the mechanisms described in this subsection. This self-reinforcing mechanism creates and sustains the competitive advantage in an industry. The influence of domestic rivalry is also known in economic theory as external economies where an increase in the industry diminishes the cost of doing business for the firms competing in that industry. According to Porter (1990, p. 144), these external economies are particularly important in the process of innovation and also benefit related and supporting industries.   How geographic concentration influences the diamond The geographical concentration influences the national diamond by increasing the interactions amongst the determinants. Porter (1990, p. 154) notes: “Competitors in many internationally successful industries, and often entire clusters of industries, are often located in a single town or region within a nation”. Geographic concentration influences the national diamond in the following ways. First, competitors notice the success of close rivals and tend to be ‘jealous’, hence increasing their motivation to compete. Second, a group of close competitors are more easily noticed by universities, research institutes and other supporting institutions, that may adapt in order to satisfy the needs of domestic firms. Firms are also keener to finance local Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  15 universities (Porter, 1990, p. 157). Hence, a common interest emerges from this geographic concentration. This mechanism also creates an environment attractive to talented people and other resources. And third, information is more concentrated and flows more easily between the various actors.  In spite of that, Porter (1990, p. 157) mentions that this geographic concentration can become an economic risk if firms do not internationalise, that is, if they limit their sales to the local market and do not develop ties outside of the core industry. On an ending note, it can be said that while the primary focus of the national diamond is the ‘nation’, it can be transposed to the regional or city level as the determinants are also found at smaller geographical units of analysis. However, Porter argues that: “it is the combination of national and intensely local conditions that fosters competitive advantage” (Porter, 1990, p. 158).  1.1.2 The sophistication of company operations and strategy The previous subsection focused on the importance of the microeconomic business environment, and notably on the ‘four broad attributes’ of a nation that enable firms to create and sustain competitive advantage. In fact, it is firms and not nations, or more generally locations, that compete (Porter, 1990, p. 33). It is the strategies that firms implement in order to organise and perform activities that result in competitive advantages. Consequently, this second subsection concentrates on the role played by firms as well as their strategies.   i Competitive strategy of firms Firms compete in industries that are the “arena in which competitive advantage is won or lost” (Porter, 1990, p. 34). By implementing competitive strategies, firms within these industries choose an approach to competing. There are two dimensions that influence the choice of a strategy: (1) the nature of competition within an industry, and (2) the position within the industry (Porter, 1990, p. 34). First, firms continuously influence industries’ Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  16 structure and competitive position by influencing and adapting to their surrounding environment. Second, firms position themselves in relation to their competitors. There are two important variables that influence the position: (1) the nature of competitive advantage, namely low cost or differentiation, and (2) the competitive scope (i.a. the range of good produced, the various distribution channels employed) (Porter, 1990, pp. 37-38).  Firms gain a competitive advantage by innovating, or to put it another way, by finding better ways to compete, for example by implementing new technologies or new ways to conduct activities, shifting towards new industry segments or using different inputs (Porter, 1990, pp. 45-47). Hence, firms that can perceive and implement these new ways to compete gain a competitive advantage. This approach is akin to Schumpeter who puts forward the strategic position of firms and the role of entrepreneurs who execute new combinations. In Schumpeter’s view, entrepreneurs rearrange factors of production (i.e. innovate) in order to create a monopolistic position and benefit from higher profits (Schumpeter, 1944). It is the search for higher profits that drives the firm’s decision to innovate and ‘move early’ (i.e. to anticipate). In order to move early (i.e. perceive new ways to compete) and to build an advantage, firms must gather knowledge about an opportunity. Consequently, information plays an important role in the process of innovation, and notably information that is not available to other firms (Porter, 1990, pp. 48-49).  Once a competitive advantage is created, it has to be sustained over time. According to Porter (1990, pp. 49-51), this sustainability depends on three conditions: (1) the source of the advantage (2) the number of distinct sources, and (3) constant improvement and upgrading. First, some sources of competitive advantage are more sustainable. “Higher order” advantages such as product differentiation or the development of advanced technology depend on a history of cumulative investment (i.a. reputation, customer relationships, specialised knowledge) (Porter, 1990, p. 50). Second, if a firm has a higher number of distinct sources of advantages, it increases the difficulty for competitors to replicate the competitive situation (Porter, 1990, p. 51). Third, and most importantly, it is the constant improvement and upgrading that is key in sustaining advantage, as the firm ‘stays ahead’ of competitors. However, this third condition is only valid if the constant improvement and upgrading is aimed at diversifying the sources of advantage and Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  17 “moving up the hierarchy” towards higher order advantages (i.e. towards improving the two other conditions) (Porter, 1990, p. 51). This process requires change which can be “unnatural” or “painful” for a successful firm. In general, it is change rather than stability which could cause uncertainty. In Porter’s view, it is the competitive pressure that pushes firms to enter this process where it has to “destroy old advantages to create new, higher-order ones” in order to sustain a competitive position (Porter, 1990, p. 51). This process can be traced back to the notion of “creative destruction” proposed by Schumpeter (1944). Hence, the quality of the business environment challenges the firms and stimulates innovation. To summarise, it can be said that (1) it is firms that compete and not locations, (2) the pressure for innovating is provoked by the business environment (3) competitive advantage arises from innovations and changes implemented by firms, and (4) competitive advantage is sustained through “relentless improvement” (Porter, 1990, p. 577).   ii The relationship between firms’ competitive strategy and the quality of the business environment As written above, firms react upon and influence their environment. The business environment not only creates pressure for firms to innovate but also gives firms better insight into industry changes. In the previous subsection, the influence of the four determinants of national advantage on firms was presented. Therefore, firms’ competitive strategy should take advantage of the quality of the business environment (e.g. seek out the most sophisticated buyers, investigate new channels, develop strong ties with innovative suppliers).  Firms can also play a role in improving the surrounding business environment. In fact, a firm can invest in factor creation, participate in the cluster development and acknowledge the importance of domestic rivalry. Consequently, a competitive strategy should take this role into account. First, a competitive strategy can focus on factor creation through investment in training schools or training programmes, in developing physical infrastructure and in getting involved with government-led projects (Porter, 1990, p. 593). Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  18 Hence, a competitive strategy can lead to more specialised and customised factors of production and ultimately lead to higher levels of productivity. Second, by favouring local suppliers, firms contribute to the formation and development of clusters (Porter, 1990, p. 596). A competitive strategy that helps the development of local suppliers and buyers increases both the size and scope of the cluster, which in turn favours the firm’s own advantages. In fact, strong competition between suppliers increases the rate of innovation and consequently the sophistication of the cluster. The previous subsection highlighted the fact that domestic rivalry has the strongest influence on each of the determinants of national advantage. By acknowledging the importance of domestic rivalry in their strategy, firms contribute to the improvement of the business environment. Hence, the competitive strategy should be aimed at expanding the domestic market through foreign acquisition or the development of spin-offs rather than favouring domestic acquisitions (Porter, 1990, p. 598).  Consequently, by further developing the national diamond through their competitive strategy, it becomes harder for foreign firms to replicate the competitive advantage. Instead, foreign firms would rather be part of the cluster which, as a result, further increases the strength of the local business environment.   iii Competing internationally An internationally successful industry, as described in subsection 1.1.1, encompasses firms that are competing internationally. Hence, competing internationally requires a global strategy, namely a strategy in which “a firm sells its product in many nations and employs an integrated worldwide approach to doing so” (Porter, 1990, p. 54). By implementing a global competitive strategy, firms further expand their competitive advantage at home.  A firm steps up internationally in segments where it has a competitive advantage that was created at home. Initially, a firm takes advantage of economies of scale and reputation resulting from worldwide sales. Then it may locate activities outside the home base to build on or to exploit the advantages of different locations (Porter, 1990, p. 63; Gugler, 2019, p. 23). In fact, globalised firms may require, amongst other things, complementary Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  19 technology, different buyer needs or specific infrastructure in order to move early and sustain their competitive position at home (Porter, 1990, p. 65). Consequently, a global strategy encompasses two dimensions: (1) configuration (i.e. concentrating or dispersing activities in different locations), and (2) coordination (i.e. between the activities situated in different locations) (Porter, 1990, p. 54).  The importance of building on the various competitive advantages that different locations may offer has been largely accepted in the economic literature, and particularly in the international business theories (amongst others: Dunning, 1980, 1998; Rugman and Verbeke, 2001; Dunning and Lundan, 2008; Rugman, 2009; Gugler, 2019). Particular attention will be given to the OLI paradigm (ownership, location and internationalisation) developed by Dunning and the FSAs/CSAs framework (firm-specific advantages and country-specific advantages) proposed by Rugman.  Dunning (1980, p. 9) proposes the OLI paradigm which evaluates the geographical patterns of industries. His paradigm aims at analysing the location choice of firms and of their activities in a globalised world (Dunning, 1998). Of particular interest in this thesis are the L-advantages (i.e. location-specific advantages), namely the advantages, or assets, that the host location offers, and which drive a firm strategy in investing in this specific location (Dunning, 1998, p. 45). Firms seek out various types of advantages such as resources, markets, advanced infrastructure or other strategic assets (i.a. “clusters externalities” and “innovative capabilities”) (Dunning, 1998, p. 50; Gugler, 2019, pp. 25-26). Consequently, a firm may decide to locate specific activities of its value chain in different locations depending on the L-advantages that a host location can offer.  Rugman proposes a complementary framework which regroups firm-specific advantages (FSAs) and country-specific advantages (CSAs) (Rugman, 2009). FSAs are “firm-specific factors that determine the competitive advantage of an organization” which are proprietary to the firm, while CSAs are defined as “country factors, unique to the business in each country” (Rugman, 2009, p. 50). FSAs are related to “the firm’s ability to coordinate the use of the advantage in production, marketing, or the customization of services” and CSAs “form the basis of the global platform from which the multinational firm derives a home-base ‘diamond’ advantage in global competition” (Rugman, 2009, p. 51). Hence, for Rugman (2009, p. 50), multinational entreprises should develop a Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  20 strategy based on the relationship between FSAs and CSAs in order to propose a unique competitive position. By combining its FSAs with the CSAs that different locations offer, the firm “makes decisions about the efficient global configuration and coordination between segments of its value chain” whether it is sales, marketing, R&D or production, for example (Rugman, 2009, p. 51).  Consequently, a firm’s global strategy is not only built on the advantages that the home location provides, but also takes into account the advantages that host locations can offer for the various activities of the firm. By taking advantage of the national determinants of host locations, a firm is able to both sustain its initial advantage and, most importantly, to evolve and develop new advantages. This way, a firm multiplies the sources of competitive advantage and moves towards higher order advantages for its various activities.  1.1.3 The state of cluster development The previous subsections have focused on two dimensions of the microeconomic competitiveness level: the quality of the business environment and sophistication of company operations and strategy. The third dimension is the state of the cluster development. Porter (Porter, 2008, pp. 213-214) defines clusters as:  Geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, firms in related industries, and associated institutions (for example, universities, standards agencies, and trade associations) in particular fields that compete but also cooperate. He also adds that clusters can be found in “virtually every” economically advanced nation and that they are important to the firms’ performance (Porter, 2008, p. 214). While clusters may also be present in developing economies, the more advanced clusters, with deeper complexities and more advanced factor conditions, suppliers and related industries, are found mostly in developed economies. Hence, clusters vary in terms of size, degree of specialisation and state of development. Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  21 These differences can also be explained through the lens of the national diamond. In the definition of clusters provided above, many elements can be traced back to the determinants of the national diamond. In fact, clusters are a particular expression of the national diamond (Porter, 2008, p. 229). The degree of development and combination of the determinants as well as their interactions influence the breadth and depth of clusters.  Porter (2008, p. 221) argues that the advantage of analysing economies with the concept of clusters, as opposed to the more traditional industry or sector classifications, is that they “align better with the nature of competition and the sources of competitive advantage” and that they “capture important linkages, complementarities, and spillovers of technology, skills, information, marketing, and customer needs that cut across firms and industries”.  Clusters also have a locational dimension as firms, suppliers and other actors are geographically concentrated. Thus, locations are of particular importance in fostering competitive advantage, notably through competition. It has been explained that competition is dynamic since the determinants of the national diamond are self-reinforcing. On the role of location, Porter (2008, p. 225) specifies: “In this broader and more dynamic view of competition, location affects competitive advantage through its influence on productivity and especially on productivity growth”. The productivity represents the value which is created per unit of factors of production such as work or capital. Hence, competitive advantage depends on how these factors of production are “used and upgraded in a particular location” (Porter, 2008, p. 225). The business environment in a location strongly influences competition. In turn, the competition in a particular location affects the productivity and prosperity of the firms in a given industry. It forces firms to innovate and upgrade their productivity, thereby developing and sustaining their competitive advantage. Hence, the information gathered in the previous subsections helps understand how clusters forge competitive advantages.    Chapter 1: The determinants affecting the prosperity of locations: A cluster perspective  22 i Cluster theory in the economic literature The co-location of similar or related activities and the agglomeration of particular industries are not new in the economic literature. At the beginning of the 20th century, the pioneering work of Alfred Marshall laid the ground for the development of theories in economic geography. Marshall (1920) notably introduced the notions of internal and external economies as well as industrial districts. These economies arise from the division of labour, and therefore the use of specialised skills and machinery (Marshall, 1920, p. 264). Marshall (1920, p. 266) separated economies of scale into two classes: internal and external economies. Internal economies are “those dependent on the resources of the individual houses of business engaged in it” and external economies are “those dependent on the general development of the industry” (Marshall 1
