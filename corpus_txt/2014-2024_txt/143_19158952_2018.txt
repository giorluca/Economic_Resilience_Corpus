Significance at (0.01***), at (0.05**), (0.1*), PCHHI is the first component made upof HHI over time, it captures 95 % of the variance.Policies that aim to increase resilience among counties need to be multilevel and addressed locally.15Diversity does not always mean a better economic performance.Policies during the recession need to focus specially in Manufacturing in order to minimize layoffs.Diversity does not play a role in counties' degree of Resilience as a whole. Specifically, in the ability to rebound of a crisis.The Greater the degree of resilience of a given county, the less amount of layoffs during a recession.TAKEAWAY1 2 3 4 5Reference : The basics you can find anywhere 5 Steps To Successful Storytelling Published on April 5, 2014 Featured in: Marketing & Advertising
