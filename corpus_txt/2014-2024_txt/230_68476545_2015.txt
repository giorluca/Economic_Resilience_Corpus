Abstract 
 
I analyzed the financial performance and stock performance of the largest four banks in the 
United States after the banking crisis of 2008. By using 2009, the year that recovery for the 
financial sector began, as a benchmark, I could determine the level of success each of the four 
banks reached in 2014 in relation to themselves and to one another. Using simple, but effective 
ratios and equations I could compare the efficiency with which upper management in each 
company has made use of asset, debt, and equity accounts. My results support the fact that larger 
accounts do not necessarily project more efficient outcomes. There appears to be more than a 
quantitative aspect involved in company performance and efficiency on the financial statement.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Methodology 
 Banks are central to the success and flow of the American economy. They come in many 
types and sizes and serve special functions in order to keep the economy afloat. Banks are 
responsible for storing the liquid wealth that people accumulate and for loaning money to 
citizens, businesses, and the government in order to fund projects (American Banking 
Association). The various sizes of banks allow them to deal loans of different amounts. A small 
bank operating in a single town or city may not be able to offer loans as large as an 
internationally operating bank such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. can offer.   
 I selected to research the performance of banks because of how central they are to the 
economy’s performance as a whole. A positive correlation between economic performance and 
bank performance may open doors to research that could help explain how banks can positively 
stimulate the economy, or in what ways the economy positively or negatively affects bank 
growth. My emphasis is J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corporation, Citigroup Inc., 
and Wells Fargo & Company. These four banks have the largest asset totals, each reaching over 
$1.6 trillion in the year 2014; the next highest bank in America has assets less than $500 billion. 
The significance in these banks lies in their size and capability to engage in certain transactions 
that normal banks could not. This allows me to analyze the performance of a large portion of 
assets in the banking industry by conducting research on four companies. 
 In this paper, I measure the banks’ financial performances after the financial sector 
collapse of 2008 using a quantitative analysis based on the companies' ability to manage key 
performance aspects of their balance sheets and income statements. Through the implementation 
of equations and ratios, I can use the 2009 financial performances as a benchmark for the 2014 
6 
 
performance of each bank. By comparing the two years, I gain insight as to how each bank was 
able to recover from the collapse of the banking industry. 
 I analyzed the key performance aspects from Section 2 in order to determine the degree 
of success that each bank experienced as the American economy slowly recovered from 2009 to 
2014. In Section 3, I discuss my findings and explain patterns within each bank’s balance sheets 
and income statements. In their balance sheets most banks in the United States do not 
differentiate between current and long-term assets, although the method I use to measure 
performance uses current assets in some areas. I separate current assets from long-term assets 
using a model created by Dr. Raymond VanNess, which he uses in his capstone course at the 
University at Albany, BMGT 481W. The appendices provide graphical representations of my 
analysis and comparisons of the firms. 
 
1.2 Overview of the Financial Crisis 
 The year 2008 saw hardships for the United States and eventually made global impact as 
financial markets over the world saw a downward economic spiral. Recession devastated the 
market in the United States, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping a steep 33.8% on 
the year. Large American economic hits included: 
1. The investment banking industry; 
2. The largest insurance company (AIG); 
3. Two government enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) chartered to facilitate 
mortgage lending; 
4. The biggest mortgage lender (Countrywide Financial Corp); 
5. The largest savings and loan (Washington Mutual); and 
6. Two of the largest commercial banks (Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch). 
7 
 
These hits directly damaged the financial sector, but their effects were felt in numerous 
industries which relied on loan-giving institutions in order to maintain cash flows and perform 
daily business operations (Havemann).  
 The housing crisis helped fuel the collapse of the banking and financial services 
industries in 2007 and 2008 because customers could not afford loans big enough to buy and 
sustain payments on houses. The ratio of individuals’ mortgage debt to income peaked in the 4th 
quarter of 2007, which corresponds to the Great Recession (Gelain, Lansing, and Natvik). The 
prices of houses increased, inflation took effect, and people were not earning money at the same 
rate as inflation was taking place. Furthermore, when the interest rates that banks and lending 
institutions must charge on loans largely outgrows the interest rates they pay to members of the 
bank, fewer people can afford to take out loans, because they are not earning enough to pay the 
loan interest. In many cases, people were accepted for loans at low rates in the early years, but 
those rates grew out of control in later years, when they hit double-digit figures (Havemann). 
The inability of mortgage owners to pay off these debts led to a build-up of penalties to 
institutions that could not collect payments because debtors had no money. Banks rely largely on 
these loan payments as a means of earning income. The lack of loan interest income hurts the 
financial sector and significantly decreases profits that banks and other money-loaning 
companies earn. As a result of the slumping housing market, banks across the nation missed out 
on asset and equity increases, which initiated the Great Recession of the modern era. 
 A combination of “predatory loans,” “predatory borrowers,” and problems with 
government regulation has been blamed for the housing bubble (Havemann). Loan institutions 
knowingly offered predatory loans to inexperienced mortgage buyers who were not able to pay. 
These buyers were enticed by low initial rates that grew to unmanageable percentages over the 
8 
 
course of years. Lenders were willing to offer these loans because mortgage insurance companies 
protected them from defaults. However, these companies were not capable of maintaining the 
number of defaults when the housing bubble popped. 
 The number of unqualified people searching for home mortgage loans was very high in 
the years before the housing bubble burst. With income that could not support consistent 
payments toward a mortgage, people searched for other means of paying a mortgage, such as 
taking out loans. These predatory borrowers accepted loan terms they could not pay, in order to 
live in houses they could not afford. Those in favor of stricter government regulation on financial 
instruments argued that companies giving predatory loans were the problem. They argued that 
the government should have strict rules to stop lending institutions from taking advantage of loan 
seekers who would not be able to afford these loans. People in favor of government deregulation 
believed that predatory borrowers were the main cause of the financial crisis. Issues existed 
when people who had insufficient income searched for loans, even though they could not afford 
to purchase a house. 
 
1.3 Suggested Solutions to the Problem 
 Banks in the United States are making attempts to return to a state of normalcy through 
the sale of short-term loans to one another. After the financial collapse, banks grew increasingly 
skeptical and refused to deal loans out to each other for fear of payment failure or bankruptcy 
(Lynch). As soon as 2010, banks returned to numbers of loans made from bank to bank that were 
reminiscent of 2000-2007, before the crisis began. Although loans to other banks are returning to 
normal, banks are making safer decisions about private loans to individuals seeking mortgages. 
9 
 
 In recent years, banks have changed their policies regarding excess capital, from loaning 
it out blindly to storing it at the Fed (Lynch). Earnings are returning to normal and banks could 
be using the money to make more loans and increase revenue, but many banks are choosing to 
maintain safe lending options. Increases in lending to large and medium- sized clients and small 
businesses are taking place, but there is still excess cash. A large problem that led to the 2008 
banking crisis was granting mortgages to people who had little income, no jobs, and nothing to 
exchange. Banks are making the healthy decision to steer away from lending money to these 
types of people and are storing the excess cash with the Fed.  
 Particularly large banks in the United States, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of 
America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, have made an increasing presence in foreign markets. The 
result of such actions increases the availability of profits outside of the U.S., while lowering the 
risk of loss of value in the long term through foreign investments.  
 “Financial markets in the United States are the largest and most liquid in the world. In 
2012, finance and insurance represented 7.9% (or 1.24 trillion) of U.S. gross domestic product” 
(SelectUSA). Financial services aid the United States by helping to finance its exports of 
manufactured and agricultural goods. Projections show that, by 2018, the potential exists for an 
increase in employment of 12% in the securities subsector of financial services alone. By the end 
of 2012, 818,000 new people were employed in the subsector. Furthermore, in 2012, at least 132 
of Fortune Magazine’s Global 500 chose to establish their headquarters in the United States to 
take advantage of the “creative, competitive, and comprehensive financial services sector” 
(SelectUSA). This fact shows the availability of opportunities that banks across America have to 
work with other companies who have succeeded on a global scale.

2 Bank Performance Measurements 
 The measurements I made represent different forms of financial management of the 
balance sheet and income statement. The four types of management I measured are cash, equity, 
asset, and share value. Each represents the company’s ability to make efficient use of the 
respective account balance or value. 
 The ratios and equations I used can also be broken down into one of three categories. 
Liquidity ratios indicate the company’s ability to pay its financial obligations when they are due. 
Profitability ratios give an indication as to how much profit a company can make with the 
available resources. Capital-market ratios “indicate a company’s ability to win the stock market 
(Ledgers Canada).  
 
2.1 Working Capital 
 Working capital is a cash management ratio which measures liquidity.  It is a 
measurement of the theoretical assets available to management after all current liabilities are 
covered. After paying all of its short-term obligations by using short-term asset accounts, the 
amount that would be left over is considered working capital: 
Working Capital = Current Assets – Current Liabilities. 
  In order to compute working capital, current liabilities must be subtracted from current 
assets on the balance sheet. Current assets is a measurement of the total assets under a 
company’s control which can be easily converted into cash or another liquid form in less than 
one year. Current liabilities are obligations of a company that are due to be paid to another 
company, person, or organization in less than one year. 
 
11 
 
2.2 Current Ratio 
 The current ratio is another cash management ratio measuring liquidity. It represents a 
firm’s ability to pay bills as they are currently falling due and is often considered a dependable 
assessment as to the company’s risk of insolvency. Also referred to as bankruptcy risk, 
insolvency risk is the risk associated with a company’s ability to pay the debts that it may owe in 
both short-term and long-term periods (Harvey): 
Current Ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. 
Assuming a firm continues to see a trend of increasing assets and/or decreasing liabilities, then 
the current ratio should see increases in the future. 
 
2.3 Return on Equity 
 Return on equity is an equity management ratio for the profitability of a company. This 
measurement represents the rate of earnings for each dollar of owner investment and how 
efficiently money is spent. Return on equity can be improved by cutting spending and increasing 
sales: 
Return on equity = (Net Income ÷ Sales) x (Sales ÷ Total Assets) x (Total Assets ÷ Equity). 
 Return on equity is comprised of three different subsections which get multiplied 
together. The first is Net Profit Margin: 
Net Profit Margin = Net Income ÷ Sales. 
Net profit margin is computed using the income statement by dividing the net income of a 
company by its sales. It gives financial statement readers an indication of a business’s 
profitability by showing the percent of sales that become net income in the income statement. 
The second portion of return on equity is asset turnover: 
12 
 
Asset Turnover = Sales ÷ Total Assets. 
Asset turnover takes the sales in a year and divides them by the total assets in the company’s 
books at the end of the year. This ratio looks at figures in both the income statement and balance 
sheet to demonstrate the effectiveness of management’s use of assets in creating a profit for the 
company. The previous two quantities are multiplied together, and then by the equity multiplier, 
in order to calculate return on equity: 
Equity Multiplier = Total Assets ÷ Book Value of Equity. 
The equity multiplier measures the amount of a business’s asset total that is financed by the 
shareholders of the company (“Equity Multiplier”). A lower ratio indicates that the investors are 
more in control of the assets and is more favorable, while a higher ratio shows that the 
company’s management may have needed to borrow more money, giving control of assets to 
creditors. 
 The components which comprise the three sections of return on equity are net income, 
sales, total assets, and equity. Net income and sales are both income statement items. Sales is 
income generated through the selling of inventory or performance of services. Net income is the 
total profit after removing expenses and taxes. Total assets and equity are both balance sheet 
accounts. Assets are economic resources owned by a company that are expected to be used to 
generate income of some sort. Equity is the difference between assets and liabilities and 
represents the amount of owner related interest. 
 
2.4 Return on Assets 
 Return on assets is an asset management ratio. Similar to return on equity, this ratio 
measures profitability: 
13 
 
Return on Assets = Net Income ÷ Total Assets. 
Return on assets is generated by dividing net income on the income by total assets. It quantifies 
asset productivity or asset utilization, highlighting the profit gained for each dollar invested into 
the business. Companies can create a better return on assets by improving the amount of net 
income received per dollar in total assets. If a business makes use of its assets to productively 
generate income or reduces its expenses during the year, it can create a better ratio for its return 
on assets. 
 
2.5 Price-Earnings Ratio 
 The price-earnings (PE) ratio is a share value management figure which measures capital-
market information. Analysts and investors use it to confidently quantify whether a share price is 
reasonable (Ledgers Canada): 
Price-Earnings Ratio = Stock Price Per Share ÷ Earnings Per Share 
 The price-earnings ratio is determined by dividing each share’s stock price by the 
earnings generated per share. The stock price of a publicly-traded company can be researched for 
any given day by finding a stock quote on a website such as Yahoo Finance, an application, or a 
widget. Earnings per share is an income statement item which is produced after determining net 
income, by dividing net income by the number of common shares outstanding. 
 
2.6 Dividend Yield Ratio 
 Similar to the price-earnings ratio, the dividend yield ratio is a capital-market ratio which 
tells us about share value management. This equation shows the return to stockholders that is 
being provided by each share: 
14 
 
Dividend Yield Ratio = Dividends Per Share ÷ Stock Price Per Share 
 Dividend yield ratio is computed by dividing the amount of dividends paid to 
stockholders by the cost of each share. Stockholders who receive larger dividends have more 
incentive to invest in a company’s shares, especially if the company is performing well and it 
appears that the stock price will continue to increase. Dividend yield ratio, and thus incentive to 
purchase a stock, can be increased by increasing the amount of dividends paid to shareholders for 
each share. The board of directors would be more inclined to increase dividend amounts if a 
company is increasing profit while selling shares at a constant rate. 
 
3 Quantitative Analysis 
3.1 J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. 
 Headquartered in Manhattan in New York City, New York, J.P Morgan’s first 
predecessor was first opened in 1799 (www.jpmorganchase.com). Today, the company operates 
in more than 60 countries with 260,000 employees worldwide. The board of directors, 
responsible for declaring dividends, consists of eleven members from different backgrounds. In 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.’s Board of Directors, many members come from Bank One 
Corporation because of a merger between J.P. Morgan and Bank One in 2004.

 Table 1 and Table 2 are used to compare the performance measures of J.P. Morgan Chase 
& Co. from 2009 and 2014. A look at the stock prices shows that the company is headed in a 
positive direction, up 50.18% in 5 years. An interesting pattern exists in the income statement 
with revenues, expenses, and net income. Revenues decreased while expenses increased, but J.P. 
Morgan still experienced a substantial increase in its net income. This trend is possible because 
of gains and losses on the income statement which are not considered to be revenues or losses; 
these include gains and losses on the sale of long-term assets, lawsuits, and extraordinary gains 
and losses, among others. J.P. Morgan also saw its working capital rise a sizeable amount, 
allowing financial statement users to see a large availability of current assets, given full payment 
of current liabilities. 
 The current ratio shows slight improvement in liquidity, although it does not show a very 
significant change. Growth in return on assets and return on equity portray efficient use of the 
two balance sheet sections. Assets and equity remained relatively constant between 2009 and 
2014, but the surge in net income increased the two ratios and gave evidence to J.P. Morgan’s 
efficiency in using assets and equity. A decline in the price-earnings ratio is a positive sign for 
investors. Even though the price of J.P. Morgan stock increased by more than $20 per share, the 
rate at which its earnings increased on each share was greater. Investors feel more confident in a 
16 
 
stock’s potential to increase when a company’s earnings grow faster than its stock price. 
Dividend yield ratio for J.P. Morgan experienced a 368% increase, more than any other large 
company by far. Investors who see a large increase in dividend yield know that they will receive 
a larger dividend in proportion to the growth or decline in stock price. From 2009 to 2014, the 
dividend paid to investors grew more than three times as much as the stock price. 
 
3.2 Bank of America Corporation 
 Although Bank of America’s (BAC’s) roots began in Boston in 1784, headquarters are 
currently located in Charlotte, North Carolina (www.bankofamerica.com). There are now 
290,000 employees across 40 countries in its more than 200 years of existence. Bank of America 
has 13 members of the board.

 Table 3 and Table 4 compare Bank of America’s performance from 2009 to 2014. BAC 
stock had the smallest percentage increase of all the large banks in the United States. While the 
increase was miniscule, the positive direction is still a sign of improvement since economic 
recovery began. Bank of America saw a decline in revenue, expenses, and working capital. It 
was also the only company of the largest four to experience a decrease in net income when 
comparing 2009 and 2014.  
 A decrease in the current ratio tells financial statement users that Bank of America has 
fewer liquid assets left after paying current debts, but a ratio greater than 1.0 is still a good sign 
of liquidity. Return on assets and return on equity both declined from 2009 to 2014, indicating 
that Bank of America was not as efficient with assets and equity in 2014 as it was in 2009. Bank 
of America’s PE ratio was negative in 2009 because of negative earnings per share. While an 
increase in this ratio is typically a negative sign for investors, the transition from negative to 
positive is a signal of forward progress. More positive light exists in the dividend yield ratio, as 
the board of directors feels more confident increasing the dividend paid to investors. This is 
evidence of the board’s belief that Bank of America is headed in a positive direction, moving 
forward.

3.3 Citigroup Inc. 
 Similar to J.P. Morgan, Citigroup Inc. is headquartered in New York City, New York 
(www.citigroup.com). After more than 200 years of operation since Citigroup’s opening in 1812, 
the company operates in more than 160 countries. The Board of Directors is composed of 12 
members.

 Table 5 and Table 6 represent the mix of growth and decline Citigroup experienced in its 
performance from 2009 to 2014. Stock price saw a large increase of 64.12%, increasing investor 
profit by about $21 per share. Citigroup was the only one of the four to have a net loss in 2009, 
which hurt many of its ratios for that year. In a similar trend to Bank of America, Citigroup had 
decreases in both revenue and expenses from 2009 to 2014, but saw an increase in net income of 
19 
 
almost $9 billion. While working capital also saw a slight decrease, this figure is insignificant 
considering Citigroup’s working capital is still greater than the other three large banks. 
 A decrease in the current ratio is irrelevant for Citigroup because a current ratio of 1.2781 
is a good statistic since it is greater than 1.0. As the only company of the four in my paper to 
experience a net loss in 2009, Citigroup had negative return on assets and return on equity. In 
2014, upper-level management completely turned around the productivity of assets and equity to 
create positive ratios. Like Bank of America, Citigroup had negative earnings per share in 2009, 
which meant a negative price-earnings ratio. In 2014, the company had positive earnings per 
share, thus creating a positive PE ratio. Citigroup does not pay dividends to its shareholders so 
the dividend yield ratio is nonexistent. 
 
3.4 Wells Fargo & Company 
 Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Wells Fargo & Company was created in that 
same city with the purpose of serving the growing West in 1852 (www.wellsfargo.com). After 
more than 150 years, Wells Fargo has expanded to serve over 35 countries with about 265,000 
employees. Consisting of 16 members, Wells Fargo’s board of directors is particularly large 
when compared to the other large banks in the United States.

 Table 7 and Table 8 display the performance measures associated with Wells Fargo from 
2009 and 2014. Company stock price increased over 106% as Wells Fargo prospered on the New 
York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Similar to Bank of America and Citigroup, Wells Fargo saw 
revenues and expenses decline, which could indicate a decrease in activity. An 87.84% increase 
in net income is a positive sign that Wells Fargo is making good transactions and can see 
continued growth if the company continues doing business with the same clients. Increased 
working capital gives management more room to use excess assets to create more value for the 
company. 
 Wells Fargo shows another decrease in the current ratio, but is still performing well in the 
category. It may be a good idea for management to be careful with this ratio because a year with 
an unexpected sharp decline in current assets or increase in current liabilities could bring the 
current ratio very close to 1.0. Return on assets and return on equity are strong aspects of Wells 
Fargo’s business performance. In 2014, Wells Fargo has made the most efficient use of its assets 
and equity out of the four largest banks in the United States. An impressive 1284.6% increase in 
return on assets from 2009 to 2014 is the most significant increase that any of these banks has 
experienced. Furthermore, a decline in the price earnings ratio helps investors feel confident 
about the stock because even with a 106% increase in stock price, the earning for each share sold 
21 
 
has increased by a greater percentage. Dividends to shareholders are also increasing at a rate that 
is greater than the increase in stock price, according to the dividend yield ratio comparison from 
2009 to 2014. 
 
4 Further Research 
 It is important to note that my research does not intend to analyze each year between 
2009 and 2014, but rather to determine if there was an overall increase or decrease in key 
performance areas for each large bank. Additional information lies in the years between 2009 
and 2014. This information would be beneficial to see if there were years of great performance 
or years of lag and what may have caused these differences in performance. National or 
international news may play a role in American banking performance and further research 
between 2009 and 2014 may uncover that forces outside of the United States could have a strong 
pull on banking performance. 
 After the banking collapse in 2008, the banking industry saw much hardship in the 
closure of 511 banks between 2009 and 2015 (FDIC). Most of the banks included on this list are 
much smaller banks that were either absorbed by larger institutions or permanently removed. 
Research can continue in the direction of considering the performances of medium and small 
sized banking firms during the recovery period, to determine if there is any relationship between 
the size of a bank and its ability to recover after the crisis. It would also be interesting to 
calculate the performance of financial institutions which absorbed the firms that were forced to 
close.

5 Conclusion  
 Many banking professionals could argue that the banking industry is the most liquid 
industry and that measurements of liquidity are irrelevant because of the availability of liquid 
assets. They should be careful to put an equal emphasis on liquidity in order to have cash 
available in the case of a financial crisis or extraordinary circumstance. In 2009, Citigroup 
experienced difficult times with a net loss even after being bailed out by the government. Bank 
of America was forced to settle a lawsuit in 2014, which hurt the company’s liquid assets and 
turned what should have been increased ratios sour. 
 The experiences of a diverse Board of Directors can add to the quality of performance 
and decisions of a company. In each board of directors, members come from a wide array of 
industries with degrees from numerous majors and concentrations. These different points of view 
combine to help the decision-making process become more efficient. 
 Economic recovery has had a generally positive effect on the large banks in the financial 
sector of the United States. The only outlier is Bank of America, which experienced declines in 
multiple areas, but also saw some increases. The decline can probably be attributed, in part, to 
the $16.65 billion penalty that Bank of America was required to pay in order to resolve 
allegations that it sold bad mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis. It was 
“the largest civil settlement ever between a single firm and the U.S. government” (McCoy and 
Johnson). If the $16.65 billion penalty is put into assets and the accounts are readjusted so the 
loss from the lawsuit did not exist, then Bank of America would have had a much better year in 
2014. Rather than experiencing decreases in most of its ratios and equations from 2009 to 2014, 
Bank of America would have seen increases in net income, current ratio, return on assets, and 
return on equity. The exclusion of this penalty for Bank of America shows that through 
23 
 
economic recovery, the four largest banks in the United States in 2014 have outperformed their 
initial year of recovery in 2009.
