Income Tax - Foreign Earned Income Exclusion - Effect of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 on Citizens or Residents of the United States Living Abroad

INCOME TAX - FOREIGN EARNED INCOME EXCLUSION - EFFECTOF THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY TAX ACT OF 1981 ON CITIZENS ORRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES LIVING ABROAD.The foreign earned income exclusion is one section of the EconomicRecovery Tax Act of 1981 which, in its entirety, is designed to pro-vide the largest tax reduction in United States history.' In draftingthe 1981 Act, Congress intended to upgrade the nation's industrialbase, stimulate productivity and investment throughout theeconomy, lower tax burdens on individuals and businesses, andrestrain the growth of the Federal Government.' The foreign earnedincome exclusion specifically is designed to "encourage Americansto work abroad to help promote the export of U.S. manufactured goodsand services."The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981' includes a number ofsubstantive revisions of United States taxation of foreign earned in-come. A taxpayer may exclude a certain amount of foreign earnedincome from his taxable gross income. The ceiling amount for the ex-clusion is $75,000 in the taxable year 1982, and increases by $5,000each year until a maximum exclusion of $95,000 earned income isreached in the taxable year 1986.1 In addition to the earned incomeexclusion, Congress allowed that housing costs provided or paid byan employer be excluded from gross income and that expenses paidby the employee be deducted in computing adjusted gross income."The housing exclusion is an amount equal to the excess of the rea-sonable cost of housing The 1981 Act makes it clear that such hous-ing expenses shall not be reasonable if they are lavish or extravagant.8The deduction for housing expenses paid by the employee is limitedto the amount equal to the excess foreign earned income, over theamount of such income excludable under that year's exclusion rate.9S.

[Vol. 12:107For the taxpayer whose expenses exceed this limitation, the excessmay be carried over as a deduction, but only for the succeeding tax-able year.'0 An election to exclude these expenses is allowed, alongwith a corresponding privilege to revoke such an election.11 Taxpayersin camps will be allowed to exclude the value of meals and lodgingprovided by their employer if certain conditions are met. These ex-clusions are available only upon the satisfaction of the residency re-quirement, which consists of either bona fide residency 18 or physicalpresence.14 Failure to satisfy the residency requirement would resultin a substantial increase in tax liability, as the entire amount of foreignearned income would be subject to United States taxation. Generally,any applicable credits for foreign taxes paid are still available underthe 1981 Act. 5 The Act provides a major change, however, in therepeal of Internal Revenue Code section 913.16 Economic RecoveryTax Act of 1981, Publ. L. No. 97-34, SS 111-115 (enacted Aug. 13,1981 and codified at I.R.C.

S 111(a)(c)(3)(C). If the taxpayer in n. 8 had actual housing expenses of $12,000 in1982, he would be able to carry over to 1983 the $2,000 of housing expenses not subjectto the deduction. However, current housing costs must be deducted before the carryoveramount can be considered. For example, if the employee received a raise in income to$95,000 in 1983, and he had $14,000 worth of housing expenses that year, he would beable to deduct the entire $14,000 amount plus $1,000 of the carryover amount. ($95,000- $80,000 exclusion'= $15,000). The remaining $1,000 of expenses from 1982 would notbe deductible, nor could it be carried over to 1984.II Id. S l11(a)(e)(1)-(2).11 Id. S 113. These conditions focus on the definition of a "camp." First, the lodging mustbe provided for the convenience of the employer. That is, the place the services are tobe rendered is in a remote area where satisfactory housing is unavailable. Second, thecamp must be located as near as is practicable to the worksite. Third, the camp must bea common area, unavailable to the public and accomodating at least 10 employees. Thisamendment eliminated the preferential $20,000 exclusion for expatriates working in hard-ship area camps; these taxpayers are allowed the amended foreign earned income exclu-sion of $75,000 increasing to $95,000.

The1976 Act amended the former section 911 in four major areas. First,it reduced the amount of exclusion from $20,000 to $15,000. 2 Sec-ond, the exclusion in the 1976 Act affected the lower portion ofthe gross income and left the remaining portion to be taxed atthe marginal tax rates which would have been in effect absentthe exclusion." This was referred to as an "exemption withprogression."24 Third, foreign taxes paid on the excluded incomewere no longer deductible, nor could they be used as a credit againstthe expatriate's federal income tax.25 Finally, the taxpayer couldelect not to claim the exclusion.2 ' The effect of this election wasbinding, however, and its impact in succeeding years unknown,thus the taxpayer was prevented from making a reasoned decision.'11 Id.

If the taxpayer chose not to elect the exclusion, he couldstill apply his foreign taxes paid as a credit against his U.S. tax due. A U.S. taxpayerneeded to calculate his tax liability under both the exclusion method and the foreign taxcredit method. As a general rule, the greater the amount of foreign income tax paid, thegreater the probability that the foreign tax credit method would result in less U.S. taxpaid than if the exclusion method were used. However, if the foreign tax rate changedin subsequent years, a taxpayer who had elected not to exclude his income might be forcedto pay more U.S. tax, as his election was irrevocable. Id.GA. J.

The 1978 Act extensively alteredthe foreign earned income exclusion and created a series of deduc-tions for the taxpayer who was unable to claim the exclusion undersection 911 as amended.

The excess tax cost is incurred eitherin the form of a tax reimbursement or as the cost of preparingan employee's tax return.'1 The Finance Committee also arguedthat the United States balance of trade is adversely affected whendomestically based companies, faced with this increased cost ofdoing business, are forced to curtail their foreign operations orreplace expatriated citizens in their work force'2 with foreign na-tionals. A third rationale for change was that the system of deduc-tions under the 1978 Act was too complex.'3 It was difficult toestimate tax liability for employment overseas, and costly to employtax professionals to file a tax return."In response to these problems with the 1978 Act, Congressenacted a system of incentives, encompassing income and housingexclusions and a relaxed foreign presence test.'5 However, no ex-planation is provided by the Committee for the specific dollaramounts allowable under the exclusions, or for the relaxation of3 Id.

The Committee did not conclude thata specific dollar limitation was needed to prevent abuse of theexclusion," but the failure to provide specific explanations makesdifficult any determination of whether the provisions will resolvethe problems arising under the 1978 Act. What has been predictedis the tax revenue effect of the 1981 Act for fiscal year 1981-1986.17Over this period of time, tax revenue losses should increase from299 million dollars to 696 million dollars."The effect of the tax revenue losses must be viewed with consid-eration of two important issues: first, the equitable treatment ofdomestic and expatriated taxpayers, and second, the impact of therevenue losses on the United States economy." At no point in eitherthe Senate Finance Committee Report' or the House ConferenceReport" do the Committees mention equitable treatment of UnitedStates taxpayers as a policy consideration in the amendment of theforeign earned income exclusions. It can be argued that the flat ex-clusion grants preferential treatment to all citizens living abroad,whether they live in a foreign country with a lower cost of livingthan the United States, or in a country with a much higher cost ofliving.52 The 1978 Act was a valid attempt to treat United Statescitizens abroad equitably by reflecting the actual excess expenseincurred by the expatriate.' However, the 1978 Act failed to treatall United States taxpayers equitably, because it still granted pref-erential treatment to the expatriate vis-a-vis the domestic tax-payer."

First, it appears that by reducing the tax burdenof American expatriates (and in turn, the burden on their employersto recompense their loss), the 1981 Act will improve the com-petitiveness of U.S. businesses abroad. Supply-side economics sug-gests that the reduction in taxes would free capital for investmentdomestically and abroad, which in turn would increase the growthrate of the Gross National Product. Proponents of a more completefree enterprise system argue that domestic taxpayers should notbe required to subsidize foreign investment.5" Market conditionswould then be allowed to determine the level of competition andinvestment in foreign countries.Closely related to the problem of competition is the adverse ef-fect on the United States balance of trade when, due to heavy tax-ation of foreign earned income, companies are forced to curtail theirforeign operations or replace expatriate employees with foreignnationals. 9 The Senate Finance Committee did not offer anyevidence to support this assumption, however, and one other studysuggests that the balance of trade may not be affected adversely.'This is also the conclusion reached in a Government AccountingOffice (GAO) Report which assumed that the foreign demand forUnited States goods would remain inelastic in the face of a reduc-tion in the number of expatriates. 1 The feasibility of this assump-tion has been refuted, however, on the basis of marketing factorsand economic effects of tax changes.62 Due to the inadequacy ofI Id.

L.the GAO model, projections under it regarding the United Statesbalance of trade are questionable. It is clear that the reduced taxliability under the 1981 Act will improve the balance of trade deficit,but the questions as to the extent of improvement and the extentto which domestic taxpayers should subsidize the improvementremain unanswered.The elimination under the 1981 Act of the complex system ofdeductions will have little effect on the United States economy.It will reduce the amount of money expended by individuals andcorporations for filing tax returns, however, and in this sense ex-patriates may remain abroad in situations where cost-efficient multi-national companies otherwise would have replaced the UnitedStates taxpayer with his foreign counterpart."The role of the foreign national in the operations of Americancorporations abroad is a crucial factor in a projection of theeconomic effect of the 1981 Act. In making this prediction, it isuseful to compare the manner in which foreign countries tax UnitedStates citizens working abroad and the law with regard to theirown citizens working abroad. A short survey of the laws of threeindustrialized European nations in this regard follows. The studyincludes France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.France taxes all persons domiciled in France on their entireglobal income." The central concept underlying this law is "fiscaldomicile"," rather than citizenship." Under this concept of fiscaldomicile, the foreign earned income of both French nationals andforeign nationals is subject to French taxation if the individualis domiciled in France.67 French law does provide exceptions tothis rule for the French national working abroad: first, the Frenchnational is taxed only on that which would have been earned ifthe work had been done in France; and second, he is not taxedcur when the United States expatriate, who buys Ford trucks, is replaced by a foreignnational who purchases Mercedes-Benz trucks instead."

This couldbe expected from a country highly dependent on internationaltrade."In Great Britain, under the United Kingdom Finance Act of1977," foreign earned income may be exempt from tax if the dutiesof employment are performed outside the United Kingdom for aperiod of 365 days, during which time the taxpayer does not returnto the United Kingdom for a period of more than 62 days.0 Thislaw allows the British expatriate approximately one more monthat home during the year than the present 1981 Tax Act allowsthe United States expatriate. Furthermore, the 1977 UnitedKingdom Act allows a 25 percent reduction from taxation forresidents performing duties outside the United Kingdom for atleast 30 days."' This allows some incentive for a British citizen toinvest abroad or exchange places with a colleague, for examplea visiting professor. The 1981 United States Act offers no suchincentive.CONCLUSIONThe Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 is designed to: (1) im-prove the competitiveness of United States businesses abroad, (2)increase exports to achieve a more favorable balance of trade, and(3) simplify the taxation of foreign earned income. The 1981 Actbrings United States tax policies with regard to foreign earnedincome in line with the more liberal treatment characteristic offoreign countries. It appears, however, that Congress, in adoptingthe 1981 Act, has abandoned the policy of equitable treatment ofdomestic and expatriated taxpayers.The Economic Recovery Tax of 1981 should be effective in in-creasing the competitiveness of United States businesses abroad,due to the additional capital that will be available from the taxreduction. The investment of this capital is not guaranteed to in-crease the exports of the businesses, however. Too many additionalfactors influence demand for foreign goods, such as the availabil-ity of superior items from other countries, individual taste, andprice. It is clear that if the goal of Congress is to achieve a more77 Id.78 Id.U.K. Finance Act 1977, Sch. 7, Para. 1(1).Salomons, Taxation of Earnings from Work Performed Abroad, 17 EUROPEAN TAX. 353(1977)."

Whether the specific changes were carefully drawnto achieve this goal, or in the alternative were less calculated revi-sions, remains to be seen. Congress should provide further explana-tion of its rationale for increasing the dollar amounts of the in-come exclusion to the present limits, and for reducing the re-quirements of the physical presence test.From the taxpayer's perspective, the amended foreign earnedincome exclusion should function as an incentive for United Statescitizens to work abroad to promote the export of United Statesgoods and services. Employment planning is simplified under the1981 Act now that a United States businessman can assess histax liability accurately from employment overseas. Depending onany applicable tax treaties between the United States and a foreigncountry, it is conceivable that the expatriate may work abroadtax-free. Tax return filing will also be simplified under the 1981Act which eliminates the complex series of deductions under sec-tion 913. However, this unilateral action should evoke some similartax response from foreign countries which are also attempting toimprove their trade networks and economies.Jonathan M. Engram1982]
