Whilenearly zero-energy buildings are becoming a new norm in many countries in the world, researchis advancing towards energy flexibility and resilience to reach energy efficiency and sustainabilitygoals. Combining the energy flexibility and energy resilience concept is rare. In this article, we aim toinvestigate the effect of energy efficiency in a new single-family building on the energy flexibilitypotential and resilience characteristics and compare these with those for an old building in the coldclimate of Finland. These two objectives are dependent on the buildings’ respective thermal mass.The heat demands of the two buildings are compared. Their technical and economic performance arecalculated to compare their flexibility and resilience characteristics. Dynamic simulation softwareis used to model the buildings. The results show that the old building has better flexibility andhigher energy cost savings when including the energy conservation activation strategy. In the oldbuilding, savings can be around EUR 400 and flexibility factor can be around 24–52% depending onthe activation duration and strategy. The new building, due to higher efficiency, may not providehigher energy cost savings, and the energy conservation activation strategy is better. In the newbuilding, savings can be around EUR 70 and the flexibility factor reaches around 7–14% dependingon the activation duration and strategy. The shifting efficiency of the new house is better comparedto that of the old house due to its higher storage capacity. For energy resilience, the new buildingis shown to be better during power outages. The new building can be habitable for 17 h, while theold building can provide the same conditions for 3 h only. Therefore, it is essential to consider bothenergy flexibility and resilience as this can impact performance during the energy crisis.Keywords: energy flexibility; energy resilience; thermal energy; energy crisis; energy pricing;Nordic climate1. IntroductionClimate change is one of the biggest challenges that is being faced. The transitiontowards a sustainable society requires buildings to be flexible and resilient to reduce climatechange, emissions and energy crises. Therefore, the European Union (EU) plans to includerenewable energy sources in an amount of 40% until 2030 in the energy mix and increaseit further until 2050 compared to 1990 levels towards carbon neutrality [1,2]. Buildingaccounts for almost 40% of the total CO2 emissions and, therefore, buildings can play amajor role in CO2 emission reduction [3]; the Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings(EPBD) has been introduced to decarbonize the building stock by 2050 [4]. The reductionin emissions, integration of renewables and reduction in peak loads can be carried out byincluding energy flexibility in a building. Another challenge faced now is the energy crisis,which is causing prolonged power outages to buildings. Due to an increase in ambienttemperature and climate change, multiple climate-related extreme events such as forestfires, extreme temperatures, storms and heavy rain occur in different regions resulting ingrid loss and blackouts [5]. These events are becoming more visible in recent times, andinclude floods in Germany and the United States of America and forest fires in Greece,Energies 2023, 16, 5506. https://doi.org/10.3390/en16145506 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energiesEnergies 2023, 16, 5506 2 of 30Italy and Turkey. With rapid urbanization and the eminent threat of climate change, theseevents can have an impact on a building’s energy infrastructure and its occupants due togrid loss [6]. Other factors of the energy crisis include human-made factors such as politicalissues between Russia and Ukraine that are causing energy and power shortages globallydue to supply chain issues. Therefore, buildings have to be energy-resilient to addressperiods of power outage and flexible to reduce energy consumption and save costs.1.1. Energy FlexibilityEnergy flexibility can assist in reducing CO2 as it addresses the effective implementa-tion of renewable energy generation, reduces peak load, balances energy use in the gridand helps in reducing the price for the end user. The energy consumption of a buildingcan be increased when the prices are low or it can be reduced when the prices are high [7],e.g., increasing the indoor temperature when the prices are low or decreasing the tem-perature when the prices are high while keeping thermal comfort [8]. This modulationor activation is also known as a demand response, i.e., shifting the energy use based onsignals such as weather and price.The importance of the demand response or energy flexibility is increasing with theincrease in energy prices [9,10]. The financial aspect and benefits have to be identified.Various studies have been carried out to show the benefits of energy flexibility [11,12]. Ithas been found that the operation of a ground-source heat pump based on price signalscan save up to 15% of the energy costs [13] in the cold climate. Another study showed thatcontrolling the heating and cooling of a building can save up to 11% of the energy cost inwarm climatic conditions [14]. Similarly, it has been found that 14% of the energy demandand cost can be reduced in commercial buildings by implementing energy flexibility forheating and cooling [15]. An experimental study shows that the energy flexibility action canreduce the energy cost by 4% depending on the flexibility options available [16]. Integratingsolar energy and energy storage such as phase change materials [17], batteries or tanks [16]can also be used for better flexibility. All the studies show that further analysis is neededto identify the benefits of energy flexibility in terms of cost and flexibility. Moreover, thebenefit of such a modulation in cold climatic regions has been further analyzed especiallyfor different ages of buildings. Another important factor is the control strategies for theactivation. Usually, set point temperatures of indoor air are used for energy flexibility; thismay cause uncomfortable indoor conditions. Studies showed that energy saving can beup to 20% in Mediterranean climatic conditions through varying the indoor air’s set pointtemperature and heat pump operation [18]. However, there is a challenge of deterioratingthermal comfort depending on weather conditions. Another study showed that in Danishclimatic conditions, there is a potential to use thermal mass to reduce the energy demandand cost; however, there is a possibility of overheating [8] in new buildings. In Finland,about 43% of the buildings were built before the 1980s and renovating them will take time.Therefore, the energy flexibility potential and control strategies both in the old and newbuildings in terms of heating have to be identified and can help in reducing the energycosts and energy demand, and improve the flexibility factor in cold climatic conditions.The flexibility factor is defined as a factor that is used to show the ability of a buildingenvelope to shift the heating demand from high- to low-price hours or to shift the peakhours’ heating demand to that of low peak hours (based on weather conditions). Thisshifting is mainly carried out based on the activation of the thermal mass of the buildingusing price or weather signals to control the heating system [8].1.2. Energy ResilienceIt is also vital that the transition towards a sustainable solution involves an adequateconsideration of climate change, especially the occurrence of extreme events, to ensure thereliable minimum performance of a building’s energy systems in the long run to supportthe building occupants’ comfort and habitability. Methods to assess the impacts of extremeevents produced by climate change and uncertainties in the design and performance of aEnergies 2023, 16, 5506 3 of 30residential building’s envelope need to be thoroughly investigated under Finnish climaticconditions. On the international level, research has been ongoing at the urban scale [19]and few studies are carried out on the building level for mild climatic conditions [19–22].No research has been carried out at the building level for Finnish conditions [20]. InFinland, winters are extremely cold and the design temperature of outdoor air for thebuildings’ systems is −26 ◦C in southern Finland and −38 ◦C in northern Finland [23];therefore, occupants’ thermal comfort and habitability can be a big challenge. Therefore, thebuilding has to be energy-resilient to maintain thermal comfort and habitability conditions.Research has been focused on ‘habitability’ as part of energy-resilient buildings [24] eitherfor mild climates [25] or for overheating conditions under grid loss [21,22]. The conceptof ‘habitability’ focuses on the indoor thermal conditions and comfort and it refers to thelength the building can remain in habitable thermal conditions after power loss through areduction in heat transfer, natural ventilation and natural light [26].Energy-resilient buildings is an emerging concept that is increasingly used to representthe performance of buildings during grid power loss caused in extreme climatic events suchas fires, extreme temperature storms, heavy rain, etc. [27]. Energy resilience in buildings isdefined as the ability of a building to provide and maintain the minimum level of thermalcomfort and habitability, and also to provide essential services, such as domestic hot water,ventilation and basic electrical power within the building, during grid power loss whichchallenges the normal operation of a building [28,29]. Energy-resilient residential buildingsare important to be studied because 87% of the time is spent indoors by occupants inmany developed countries [30] and occupants’ thermal comfort is an essential servicethat a building must provide. However, the energy-resilient building concept has not yetbeen adequately explored in the cold climate of Finland, as its definition has not beenclearly articulated and assessment is mostly carried out at the urban scale [31]. For thisreason, habitability thresholds, boundary conditions and methods are needed to be defined,which requires extensive research on the extreme cold winters of Finland. Additionally,research where the aim is to evaluate both energy flexibility and resilience together is scarce.Therefore, a holistic study is needed that can not only address the energy flexibility issuesbut also consider and presents the energy resilience issues in cold climatic conditions.This article contributes to analyzing the interaction between the energy flexibility andresilience of a building and addresses the research gap that exists in these connections.The novelty of the study is the close comparison between the energy performance of theold and new building (detached house) and highlighting the important link between theenergy flexibility and resilience of the buildings. The technical and economic analysesof the buildings are carried out as case studies, that aim to achieve energy flexibility andresilience in Finland as an illustration of the Nordic climate. As no regulations or guidelinesexist for the link between energy resilience and flexibility in cold climates, this articleaddresses this key interlink and gap. The objective of the article is to develop and combinethe methods that can improve the energy flexibility of old and new buildings based on pricesignals and also to present the impact of thermal mass activation durations on buildingenergy performance. Furthermore, a technical framework of energy-resilient buildingsand their application in the Finnish environment is introduced. The focus of the studyis on the heating energy and demand of the simulated buildings and neither renewableenergy sources nor auxiliary energy storage (electrical or heat) is considered. This article isuseful not only for cold climatic regions, such as the Nordics, Scandinavia, Canada, China,and the United States of America, but it is useful for the international perspective as well,as similar approaches and methods can be used in various climatic zones such as arid,tropical, Mediterranean, etc., to control and to estimate the performance of a building interms of energy flexibility and energy resilience. The present study scope is limited to themodeling, computational and simulation activity and no experimental work is carried out.Moreover, no real or pilot building exists in the Finnish climatic conditions that integrateenergy flexibility and resilience together. The buildings are modeled and simulated usingthe TRNSYS (Transient System Simulation Tool) [32] dynamic simulation software, whichEnergies 2023, 16, 5506 4 of 30is widely used in research and technical projects. The TRNSYS 17 software is used andvalidated in various energy projects such as in Finland, [33] Carilsheim, Germany [34], andin Drake Landing Solar Community, Canada [35]. The modeled buildings in the article aretypical archetype buildings based on the Finnish buildings’ regulations [23] and comparedagainst the typical building parameters in Finland [33,36]. Simulations for energy flexibilityand resilience are required in the context of residential buildings in the Nordic region thatcan be used to provide basic knowledge and a computational model for future experiments.These buildings can soften the impact of high energy costs and provide flexibility. Moreover,they can provide resilience against the energy crisis that is now evident.This method can further be applied to other types of buildings in the Nordics and inthe global level.

Simulation Software: TRNSYSAn energy simulation software known as TRNSYS 17 [32,34] was used to modeland perform a dynamic simulation of the energy systems. This simulation software isEnergies 2023, 16, 5506 6 of 30widely used by the scientific community, for instance in [38,39], and validated by theDrake Landing Community, in Canada [35]. In TRNSYS, the modules used were as follows:building (TYPE 56), control of indoor air set point temperature (TYPE 2b, 14 h), temperaturecontrol (TYPE 1233), and weather data (TYPE 15). TRNSYS is used for modeling buildingsand their control systems as it provides flexibility [40].4. Building Thermal Energy System OperationIn this article, the energy conservation and storage potential of the building’s thermalmass is estimated. The reference indoor air set point temperature for the space heatingof the zone is set at 21.5 ± 0.5 ◦C. This space heating temperature corresponds to therecommendation of the Finnish Society of Indoor Air Quality and Climate [41] and to theFinnish building regulations [23]. In this article, two activation methods are simulatedfor the typical heating period and also for the whole year. This is carried out to estimatethe performance and behavior of the different types of buildings in detail under varioussituations of activation. Activation is carried out for different starting times and durationbetween 1 h–18 h. A duration of more than 18 h is not considered as occupants may notaccept long changes in comfort [8] and uncertainties are higher in terms of energy cost andweather prediction. Activation is carried out by varying the indoor air set point temperatureof the zone to evaluate the different performances of the two types of buildings in Finnishconditions. The two activation methods that are applied are discussed in Section 4.1. Spacecooling and domestic hot water are not considered in the calculation.4.1. Controls of the Thermal Energy SystemThe two activation methods that are applied for energy flexibility are heat energyconservation and heat energy storage. The heating system is assumed to be ideal and thebuilding is heated using the heaters inside the zone.In the method of heat energy conservation for energy flexibility, the indoor air set pointtemperature of the space heating is decreased by 1.5 ◦C depending on the price signal. Thisis selected as it is an acceptable range for the variation in the space heating temperatureinside the building and for comfort [41].In the method of heat energy storage for energy flexibility, instead of reducing theindoor air set point temperature of space heating, it is increased by 1.5 ◦C depending onthe price signal. This is c to keep the change in the space heating temperature reasonableand for comfort [41].5. Energy and Cost Calculations for Flexibility Assessment5.1. Energy Flexibility CasesTwo types of energy flexibility cases are discussed in the article to analyze the perfor-mance of the old and new buildings. Weather-based and cost-based energy flexibility areconsidered. Weather-based analysis is performed to study the behavior while cost basedflexibility is carried out to identify the cost saving potential and flexibility factor.The building is heated during the heating period at the indoor air set point temperatureto reach a steady period, and activation is carried out during the average heating period.The results of energy storage and energy conservation activations are evaluated separately,as they have different characteristics.Some indicators are extracted from the simulations [8]:Qheat = Qheat (activation) − Qheat (reference) (1)Qheat charge = ∑ Qheat, when Qheat > 0 (2)Qheat discharge = ∑ Qheat, when Qheat < 0 (3)Energies 2023, 16, 5506 7 of 30Shifting efficiency = −Qheat discharge/Qheat charge (4)Flexibility factor =∑low price Qheat − ∑high price Qheat∑low price Qheat + ∑high price Qheat(5)Equation (1) shows the difference between the heat demand in the reference and theactivation cases. In some scenarios, during the activation of the thermal mass, the energyconsumption increases compared to that of the reference case (the reference indoor air setpoint temperature scenario). In this scenario, the amount of energy used is called chargeheat (Qheat charge) as shown in Equation (2). Similarly, energy consumption decreasescompared to that of the reference case (the reference indoor air set point temperaturescenario). In this scenario, the amount of energy used is called discharge heat (Qheat discharge)as shown in Equation (3). The ratio of these two factors is called shifting efficiency (asshown in Equation (4)). On the other hand, in the case of conservation, this ratio is greaterthan 1 as energy consumption decreases. Equation (5) shows the flexibility factor; in otherwords, it shows the energy flexibility performance of the building. It shows the abilityof the building to shift the energy use from certain hours to other hours based on thecontrol strategies (such as shifting from high-price to low-price hours or using weathersignals). It considers the energy charged and discharged based on the hourly energy pricesignals that vary at each time step. The energy price signal used for calculation is explainedin Section 5.3. The energy flexibility potential of the building is better if the flexibilityfactor is high. Compared to the reference case, when additional energy is charged in thebuilding to increase the indoor temperature based on the price signal, the heating energy ishigher than the reference heating power and it is called a low-price Qheat in Equation (5).Similarly, compared to the reference case, when the energy is discharged or removed fromthe building to decrease the indoor temperature based on the price signal, the heatingenergy is lower than the reference heating energy and it is called a high-price Qheat inEquation (5). These energy flows are included in Equation (5) to calculate the flexibilityfactor. According to Equation (5) if no heat is charged or discharged and the heating use isthe same in low- and high-price periods, then the factor is 0. The limitation of this flexibilityfactor is that it can lead to different values when it is used for other signals such as gridand climatic conditions [8].5.2. WeatherIn this paper, the weather data used are from the Helsinki Vantaa airport for theyear 2016 [42]. The hourly ambient temperature and the duration curve of the ambienttemperature are shown in Figure 2.Energies 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 32    Figure 2.

The cost data are used from Nordpool and provide the real-time electricity price for each hour; see Figure 3. The cost includes the distribution and taxes [9]. This study is about the operational cost of the energy in the building. Figure 3 shows the duration curve of the electricity price and the price range is between 15 cents/kWh and 10 cents/kWh during most of the hours.   Figure 3.

Section 6.1 analyzes and describes the energy flexibility and activation behavior of the old and new buildings under heat energy conservation and storage activation using ambient temperature as a control signal only, and energy cost is not considered. For this study, a short duration (i.e., winter week) is considered to analyze the activation, temperature and heating behavior in detail as heat-ing energy is essential in cold regions. This is carried out to analyze the energy flexibility potential and behavior of the old and new building structure with respect to the ambient temperature in detail.

This is carried out to heat the thermalmass of the building and store heat, so it can be released when the indoor air set pointtemperature is back to the reference point of 21.5 ± 0.5 ◦C. Different activation durationsare considered such as 2 h, 6 h and 18 h and compared against the reference case (withoutactivation). Different duration hours are simulated to analyze the behavior under the shortand long durations of activation. The change in the indoor air set point temperature isshown in Figure 4.

Old Building Heat Energy Storage It is assumed that during heat energy storage activation, the indoor air set point tem-perature of the zone is increased by 1.5 °C. This is carried out to heat the thermal mass of the building and store heat, so it can be released when the indoor air set point temperature is back to the reference point of 21.5 ± 0.5 °C. Different activation durations are considered such as 2 h, 6 h and 18 h and compared against the reference case (without activation). Different duration hours are simulated to analyze the behavior under the short and long durations of activation. The change in the indoor air set point temperature is shown in Figure 4. The hours selected for analysis are from 615 to 687 h and the activation hour is 638 h. This duration is selected when the ambient temperature is cold at around −10 °C–−15 °C, which is the typical average temperature in winters in Southern Finland. The same time window is selected in the following new building case. It can be observed that when 2 h is selected for the activation duration, the building’s indoor temperature cannot reach the indoor air set point temperature of 23 °C. However, when 6 and 18 h are selected for the activation, the building’s indoor temperature reaches the indoor air set point temper-ature of 23 °C.  Figure 4.

In all the activation durations, when the indoor air set point temperature increases to 23 °C the heating power increases. As soon as the indoor air set point temperature is returned to the reference indoor air set point temperature of 21.5 °C, the heating power reduces and goes below the reference scenario’s heat power (blue line) for a few hours until it returns to the reference heating line.  21.021.522.022.523.023.5600 620 640 660 680 700Indoor temperature (oC)Hours2 h 6 h 18 h Reference indoor air set point temperatureFigure 4.

Figure 6 shows the energy charged (blue bar) and discharged (orange bar) to reach the indoor air set point temperature of 23 °C for the activation of energy storage compared to the reference scenario’s indoor air set point temperature of 21.5 °C. It can be observed that the amount of the energy charged and discharged varies depending on the activation duration. Generally, the energy charged and that discharged increase with the increase in the activation duration. The energy charge increases from 3.8 kWh (for 2 h) to 19 kWh (for 18 h). Similarly, the energy discharge increases from 1.9 kWh (2 h) to 2.41 kWh (for 18 h) as the energy stored in the structure is released back to the zone and this reduces the heat-ing power to heat the zone compared to that of the reference scenario.  Figure 6. Energy charged and discharged during heat energy storage in the old building in Finland. Figure 7 shows that in the case of storage activation, the shifting efficiency is less than one.

Compared to the reference case, when additional energy is charged in the building to increase the indoor temperature to 23 °C, the heating energy (2 h, 6 h, 18 h) is higher than the reference heating power and it is called Qheat charged.

Figure 8. Flexibility factor during heat energy storage in the old building. It can be observed that the energy flexibility factor increases as the activation duration increases. This is due to an increase in the difference between the energy charged and discharged as the activation duration increases.

This is due to poor insulation level in the old building’s envelope.  0.40.60.830.000.100.200.300.400.500.600.700.800.902 h 6 h 18 hFlexibility factorHeating durationFigure 13.

Figure 15 shows the heat power demand for the reference scenario and also for the activation hours of 2 h, 6 h and 18 h. It can be observed that compared to the energy storage scenario of the old building (Figure 5), the maximum peak heating power is lower for the new building (8 kW), as the new building envelope is efficient, whereas for the old build-ing the maximum heat power is 15.7 kW. There are a few instances when the heating power reaches near zero in the new building case (Figure 15) at 658 h, whereas in the old building case, the heating power Figure 5 does not go close to zero. This is due to the energy-efficient envelope of the building and the thermal mass activation of the new building that releases the heat which is stored during activation.  Figure 15. Heating activation during heat energy storage in the new building. Figure 16 shows the energy charged (blue bar) and discharged (orange bar) to reach the indoor air set point temperature of 23 °C for the activation of energy storage compared to the reference scenario’s indoor air set point temperature of 21.5 °C. It can be observed that the energy charge and energy discharge vary depending on the activation duration. In the energy storage case for the old building (Figure 6), the difference between the en-ergy charged and discharged is large in each activation duration hour. In the new build-ing, the difference between the energy charged and discharged is smaller in each activa-tion duration hour. This again shows that new building is better at storing and using heat energy.  21.021.522.022.523.023.5600 620 640 660 680 700Indoor temperature (oC)Hours2 h 6 h 18 h Reference indoor air set point temperature−2 0246810600 620 640 660 680 700Heat power (kW)Hours2 h 6 h 18 h ReferenceFigure 14.
