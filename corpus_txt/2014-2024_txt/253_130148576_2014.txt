The	world	remains	mired	in	a	deep,	 prolonged	 crisis,	 and	 the	 key	 question	 seems	 to	 be	 how	 to	 get	 out	 of	 it.	 The	purpose	of	our	paper	is	to	ask	a	very	different	question	that	few	if	any	seem	concerned	with:	can	capitalists	afford	recovery	in	the	first	place?		Our	 starting	 point	 is	 very	 different	 from	 the	 conventional	 creed,	 both	 mainstream	 and	heterodox	(Nitzan	and	Bichler	2009a;	Bichler	and	Nitzan	2012b).	Liberals	and	Marxists	see	capital	as	an	economic	entity	and	capitalism	as	a	mode	of	production	and	consumption,	so	for	them,	the	accumulation	crisis	is	anchored	in	the	economics	of	production	and	consumption.	By	contrast,	we	see	capital	as	a	symbolic	representation	of	power	and	capitalism	as	a	mode	of	power,	 so	 for	 us,	 the	 crisis	 of	 accumulation	 is	 a	 crisis	 of	 capitalized	 power.	 Furthermore,	whereas	 the	 economic	 viewpoint,	 particularly	 the	 Marxist,	 sees	 the	 current	 crisis	 as	 the	symptom	 and	 culmination	 of	 a	 long	 process	 of	 weakening	 accumulation,	 for	 us	 it	 is	 the	consequence	 of	 capital	 having	 reached	 unprecedented	 strength	 (Bichler	 and	 Nitzan	 2008,	2009;	Nitzan	and	Bichler	2009b;	Bichler	and	Nitzan	2010;	Kliman,	Bichler,	and	Nitzan	2011).		According	to	our	research,	the	accumulation	of	capital‐read‐power	might	be	approaching	its	asymptotes,	 or	 limits	 (Bichler	 and	 Nitzan	 2012a).	 The	 closer	 capitalized	 power	 is	 to	 its	asymptotes,	the	more	difficult	it	is	to	augment	it	further.	Capitalists,	though,	have	no	choice.	They	are	conditioned	and	compelled	to	increase	their	capitalized	power	without	end,	and	that	relentless	drive	breeds	 conflict.	 It	 forces	 capitalists	 to	 increase	 their	 threats,	 escalate	 their	sabotage	and	intensify	their	use	of	force	–	and	this	intensification	is	in	turn	bound	to	trigger	stronger	resistance,	contestations,	uprisings	and	more.			By	the	early	2000s,	capitalists	began	to	realize	the	unfolding	of	this	asymptotic	scenario.	They	started	to	sense	that	their	power	is	nearing	its	limits	and	that	accumulation	is	becoming	ever	more	 difficult	 to	 achieve	 and	might	 be	 reversed.	 And	 given	 that	 capitalization	 is	 forward‐looking,	the	result	has	been	a	major	bear	market.	Measured	in	constant	dollars,	stock	prices	are	still	below	their	peak	levels	of	fifteen	years	ago:	in	August	2014,	the	Datastream	World	Index	was	still	2	per	cent	shy	of	its	1999	level,	while	the	U.S.	S&P	500	was	14	per	cent	lower.			The	present	paper	contextualizes	and	examines	this	process	from	the	viewpoint	of	economic	policy.	 Thematically,	 the	 analysis	 is	 divided	 into	 three	 parts.	 The	 first	 part	 deals	with	 the	mainstream	macroeconomic	perspective.	This	approach	claims	to	have	already	solved	the	key	theoretical	riddles,	so	the	main	emphasis	here	is	on	the	practical	question	of	how	to	engineer	a	 recovery.	 The	 answer	 to	 this	 question,	 though,	 remains	 elusive.	 The	 recent	 crisis	 has	undermined	the	self‐confidence	of	policymakers:	they	are	no	longer	certain	of	their	theoretical	models,	they	mistrust	their	policy‐tools,	and	they	feel	increasingly	short	on	policy	ammunition.	The	second	part	examines	 the	Marxist	view.	Marxists	 stress	 the	 inherent	 contradictions	of	E	  112  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?accumulation,	 so	 the	 question	 for	 them	 is	 the	 very	 possibility	 of	 sustained	 growth.	 This	approach	 offers	 very	 important	 insights,	 but	 its	 application	 to	 contemporary	 capitalism	 is	hampered	by	conceptual	quandaries	and	empirical	inconsistencies.	Mainstream	and	Marxist	economics	obviously	are	very	different	from	each	other	in	framework	and	goals.	Nonetheless,	they	 share	 a	 common	 premise:	 they	 both	 consider	 capitalism	 a	 mode	 of	 production	 and	consumption.	From	this	common	viewpoint,	crises,	although	sometimes	trigged	and	further	complicated	by	financial,	political	and	societal	factors,	are	ultimately	about	the	‘real	economy’.	The	third	and	final	part	challenges	this	common	premise	by	taking	the	view	that	capital	is	not	a	 ‘real’	 productive	 entity	 but	 commodified	 power,	 and	 that	 capitalism	 is	 not	 a	 mode	 of	production	and	consumption	but	a	mode	of	power.	Capitalized	power,	we	argue,	hinges	not	on	growth,	but	on	strategic	sabotage.	So	from	this	viewpoint,	the	key	question	to	ask	is	not	how	capitalists	can	achieve	and	sustain	a	recovery,	but	whether	they	can	afford	it	to	start	with.	Our	answer	to	this	question	is	negative,	at	least	for	the	United	States.	We	show	that,	contrary	to	popular	conviction,	over	the	past	century	the	U.S.	capitalist	income	share‐read‐power	thrived	not	on	prosperity	and	the	growth	of	employment	but	on	crisis	and	rising	unemployment.	U.S.	policymakers	therefore	are	locked	into	a	conceptual	and	practical	corner:	if	they	act	on	their	conventional	belief	and	boost	 the	capitalist	 income	share	to	trigger	economic	growth,	 they	would	achieve	the	very	opposite	result;	and	if	they	manage	to	rekindle	growth,	they	would	end	up	undermining	the	accumulation‐read‐power	of	capitalists.			Mainstream	Macroeconomics		The	stock	market	crash	of	2008	and	the	ensuing	Great	Recession	heighted	the	systemic	fear	of	the	ruling	class	–	the	sense	that	capitalism	itself	might	be	in	danger	and	that	they,	the	rulers,	might	be	losing	their	grip	over	the	situation	(Bichler	and	Nitzan	2010;	Kliman,	Bichler,	and	Nitzan	2011).	The	quotes	in	Box	1	suggest	that	this	fear	continues	unabated.	In	2008,	former	Fed	Chairperson	Alan	Greenspan	spoke	of	himself	and	his	 like	being	 in	a	state	of	 ‘shocked	disbelief’	after	their	‘whole	intellectual	edifice’	had	collapsed,	while	journalist	Gillian	Tett	of	the	 Financial	 Times	 described	 a	 sense	 of	 total	 confusion,	 as	 capitalists,	 policymakers	 and	smaller	 investors	 realized	 that	 their	 ‘intellectual	 compass’	 had	 been	 broken.	 The	 next	 five	years	have	done	little	to	ease	this	systemic	fear.	In	2013,	central	bankers	admitted	quite	openly	that	 they	 have	 no	 clue	 as	 to	 what	 is	 going	 on	 –	 or,	 in	 their	 own	words,	 that	 they	 are	 in	‘uncharted	territory’	which	they	do	not	‘fully	understand’,	and	that	they	are	‘flying	blind	when	steering	their	economies’.	In	that	same	year,	Lawrence	Summers,	a	former	Treasury	Secretary	and	 until	 recently	 a	 keen	 promoter	 of	 neoliberalism,	wondered	whether	 stagnation	might	prove	to	be	the	‘new	normal’,	while	in	2014,	Nobel	Laureate	Edmund	Phelps,	an	unrelenting	proponent	of	free	markets,	conjured	up	the	spectre	of	‘regulation’	and	‘corporatist	values’	to	explain	why,	despite	neoliberalism,	capitalism	has	lost	its	‘past	dynamism’.		  113  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?Box	1	Systemic	Fear		Alan	Greenspan:		The	whole	intellectual	edifice	.	.	.	collapsed	in	the	summer	of	last	year.	.	.	.	[T]hose	of	us	who	have	 looked	 to	 the	self‐interest	of	 lending	 institutions	 to	protect	 shareholder’s	equity	(myself	especially)	are	in	a	state	of	shocked	disbelief.

If	it	fails,	as	occurred	this	year,	market	stability	is	undermined	(Andrews	2008;	U.S.	Congress	2008,	emphases	added).

Fearful	and	confused,	people	react	erratically	to	changing	news,	reinforcing	 confused	 market	 behaviour.	 It	 doesn’t	 help	 that	 our	 economic	 theories	 were	constructed	for	a	different	world.

Gillian	Tett:		[T]he	pillars	of	faith	on	which	this	new	financial	capitalism	were	built	have	all	but	collapsed,	and	that	collapse	has	left	everyone	from	finance	minister	or	central	banker	to	small	investor	or	 pension	 holder	 bereft	 of	 an	 intellectual	 compass,	 dazed	 and	 confused	 (Tett	 2009,	emphasis	added).		Chris	Giles:		[Some]	 of	 the	 leading	 figures	 in	 central	 banking	 conceded	 they	were	 flying	blind	when	steering	 their	 economies.	 Lorenzo	 Bini	 Smaghi,	 the	 former	 member	 of	 the	 European	Central	Bank’s	executive	board,	captured	the	mood	at	the	IMF’s	spring	meeting,	saying:	‘We	don’t	fully	understand	what	is	happening	in	advanced	economies’.	In	this	environment	of	uncertainty	about	the	way	economies	work	and	how	to	influence	recoveries	with	policy,	Sir	Mervyn	King,	the	outgoing	governor	of	the	Bank	of	England,	said	that	‘there	is	the	risk	of	appearing	to	promise	too	much	or	allowing	too	much	to	be	expected	of	us’.	.	.	.	The	central	bankers	were	clear	that	they	had	got	it	wrong	before	the	crisis,	allowing	themselves	to	be	  114  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?lulled,	by	stable	inflation,	into	thinking	they	had	eliminated	financial	vulnerabilities.	.	.	.	The	question	now	was	whether	central	bankers	are	making	the	same	mistake	in	their	efforts	to	secure	 a	 recovery.

The	problem	outlined	by	Sir	Mervyn	was	that	the	uncertainty	is	so	pervasive	that	no	one	can	be	sure	that	the	expansionary	monetary	policy	is	appropriate	in	a	world	where	nations	are	learning	they	are	poorer	than	they	expected,	but	are	not	sure	by	how	 much.	 How	 can	 we	 be	 sure	 ‘we	 really	 are	 [not]	 running	 the	 risk	 of	 reigniting	 the	problems	that	led	to	the	financial	crisis	in	the	first	place?’	Mr	Bean	asked	the	IMF	panel	(Giles	2013,	emphases	added).			Lawrence	Summers:		Why	stagnation	might	prove	to	be	the	new	normal:	In	the	past	decade,	before	the	crisis,	bubbles	and	loose	credit	were	only	sufficient	to	drive	moderate	growth.	 .	 .	 .

Figure	1	provides	the	broad	context.	The	chart	is	a	snapshot	of	the	‘state	of	the	world	economy’	since	the	beginning	of	the	systemic	crisis	in	the	early	2000s.

We	can	see	the	first	downturn	in	2000‐2002.	The	developing	world	and	emerging	markets	recovered	briskly	from	this	decline,	but	the	advanced	countries	showed	a	very	feeble	recovery.	Then	came	the	2008‐9	drop.	This	downturn	was	much	more	serious	(–5	per	cent	for	the	developed	world	and	–3	per	cent	for	the	world	as	a	whole),	and	the	recovery	from	it	limited	and	brief.	By	2010,	both	regions	–	and	the	world	as	whole	–	began	to	decelerate	rapidly.		Policymakers	looking	at	this	chart	must	get	the	shivers.	Despite	massive	policy	intervention	–	including	unorthodox	measures	that	only	a	few	years	back	would	have	been	considered	unthinkable	 –	 the	world	 economy	has	 been	 largely	 unresponsive.	 In	 2013,	 the	 advanced	  116  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?countries	 showed	a	modest	uptick,	but	growth	soon	decelerated,	and	many	now	 fear	 the	uptick	was	a	‘dead	cat	bounce’.			 	The	Real/Nominal	Dichotomy		To	understand	 the	gravity	of	 the	 situation	 for	policymakers,	 and	 for	 the	 ruling	 class	more	broadly,	 it	 is	 useful	 to	 provide	 some	 theoretical	 background.	 Consider	 the	 simple	decomposition	offered	in	Equation	1:		1. deflatorGDPnominalGDPrealGDPnominal  		or,		PQY  		The	equation	starts	with	the	total	dollar	value,	or	nominal	value	of	GDP	(which	we	call	Y).	This	value	is	the	product	of	two	components:	the	quantity	of	commodities	being	produced,	which	economists	call	‘real’	GDP	(denoted	as	Q	in	the	equation),	and	the	average	nominal	or	dollar	price	 of	 those	 commodities,	 which	 is	 given	 by	 the	 GDP	 deflator	 (and	marked	 by	P	 in	 the	equation).			This	decomposition,	which	goes	back	to	David	Hume’s	classical	dichotomy	between	the	‘real’	and	the	‘nominal’	spheres	of	economic	life,	underlies	the	national	accounts	everywhere.	We	consider	this	bifurcation	to	be	deeply	problematic,	both	theoretically	and	empirically	(Nitzan	1989;	Nitzan	and	Bichler	2009a:	Ch.	8).	But	since	most	if	not	all	economists,	both	mainstream	and	heterodox,	seem	to	accept	the	real/nominal	duality	as	an	article	of	faith,	and	given	that	we	are	concerned	here	with	their	views,	not	ours,	we	shall	use	it	in	this	paper	without	further	qualification.		The	Keynesian	Revolution			Until	 the	 1930s,	 the	 conventional	 liberal	 dogma	 was	 that	 government	 intervention	 was	unnecessary	 and	 harmful:	 it	 was	 unnecessary	 because	 the	 market	 mechanism	 was	 self‐correcting,	which,	in	today’s	lingo,	means	that	real	GDP	tends	to	oscillate	near	its	optimal,	full‐employment	value	to	begin	with;	and	it	was	harmful	because	it	led	to	distortions,	misallocation	and	undue	 inflation	or	deflation.	Now,	although	the	pre‐1930s	economists	did	not	 think	 in	explicitly	 macroeconomic	 terms,	 we	 can	 use	 Equation	 1	 to	 translate	 their	 argument	 into	contemporary	jargon.	In	a	nutshell,	their	claim	was	that	government	intervention	cannot	raise	real	GDP	(Q),	which	is	already	at	its	maximal	 level	(although	it	certainly	can	lower	it).	This	  117  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?inability	means	that	any	intervention	can	only	inflate	or	deflate	nominal	GDP	(Y)	by	raising	or	lowering	prices	(P).	Parenthetically,	we	should	add	here	 that	 this	view	was	also	shared	by	Marx,	who	thought	that	a	large	state	would	undermine	accumulation	by	taxing	away	part	of	the	surplus	value	(Baran	and	Sweezy	1966:	142‐143).			The	crisis	of	the	1930s	shattered	this	belief.	A	large	chunk	of	the	labour	force	was	unemployed,	productive	capacity	was	lying	idle	and	the	invisible	hand	did	nothing	to	put	them	back	to	work.	This	much	was	obvious	to	anyone	who	could	see.	But	the	economists	could	see	only	through	their	theory,	and	that	theory	asserted	that	persistent	unemployment	was	impossible.			And	 that	 is	 where	 Keynes	 came	 into	 the	 picture.	 His	 great	 achievement	was	 to	 persuade	economists	(1)	that	the	real	economy	can	get	stuck	at	less	than	full	employment;	and	(2)	that,	in	terms	of	Equation	1,	the	government	can	remedy	the	situation	because	it	can	impact	not	only	the	nominal	price	level	(P),	but	also	the	real	level	of	output	(Q).			Keynes	identified	two	key	problems,	both	anchored	in	base	instincts.	The	first	problem	was	a	mismatch	of	 investment	and	savings.	As	society	grows	richer,	he	argued,	 the	propensity	 to	invest	declines	while	the	propensity	to	save	rises.	And	since	saving	and	investment	decisions	are	made	by	different	agents,	the	result	of	this	mismatch	is	‘deficient	demand’	and	a	tendency	for	 stagnation	and	unemployment.	The	second	problem	was	 that	 investment	decisions	are	governed	by	the	highly	erratic	and	largely	unpredictable	‘animal	spirits’	of	investors,	which	make	capitalism	inherently	unstable.			Now,	given	that	capitalism	tends	to	stagnation	and	instability,	and	given	that	the	government	can	affect	the	real	economy	as	well	as	prices,	it	made	sense	for	governments	to	intervene	in	order	to	save	capitalists	–	and	capitalism	more	generally	–	from	their	own	folly.			The	Keynesian	Record		The	historical	record	seems	to	confirm	this	view.	Figure	2	shows	the	U.S.	rate	of	unemployment	and	GDP	growth	since	the	late	1880s.	Unemployment	is	plotted	against	the	right‐hand	scale	and	GDP	growth	against	the	left‐hand	scale.	The	data	are	divided	into	two	sub‐periods:	until	1946	and	from	1946	onward.			To	explain	what	we	have	done	here,	consider	the	rate	of	unemployment.	We	have	taken	the	period	 until	 1946,	 and	 for	 this	 period	 we	 have	 computed	 the	 series	 mean	 and	 standard	deviation.	 The	 top	 dashed	 red	 line	 is	 equal	 to	 the	 mean	 of	 the	 series	 plus	 one	 standard	deviation	(which,	in	this	case,	adds	up	to	11.4	per	cent),	while	the	bottom	dashed	line	is	equal	to	the	mean	minus	one	standard	deviation	(2.4	per	cent).	According	to	the	statisticians,	the	9	per	cent	range	between	these	two	lines,	equivalent	to	two	standard	deviations,	should	contain	  118  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.net(right)(left)11.2-3.211.42.47.44.16.1-0.3roughly	two	thirds	of	the	squared	variation	of	the	unemployment	rate	during	1886‐1946	and	therefore	gives	us	a	rough	sense	of	the	series’	volatility	in	that	period.	The	same	procedure	has	been	applied	to	the	period	from	1946	onwards,	and,	as	we	can	see,	the	volatility	here	is	almost	three	times	smaller:	the	top	dashed	line	is	at	7.4	per	cent	while	the	bottom	one	is	at	4.1	per	cent,	yielding	a	range	of	only	3.3	per	cent.	The	same	calculations	are	shown	for	the	GDP	growth	series,	and	here,	too,	we	can	see	a	marked	decline	in	volatility	between	the	two	periods.

The	data	serve	to	explain	why,	during	the	early	1970s,	both	Milton	Friedman	and	Richard	Nixon	proclaimed	that	‘we	are	all	Keynesian	now’.2	Governments	seem	to	have	learnt	how	 to	 ‘manage’	 their	 economies.	 Not	 only	 have	 they	 prevented	 a	 repeat	 of	 the	 Great	Depression,	 they	 have	 also	 significantly	 reduced	 the	 instability	 that	 radical	 political	economists	had	predicted	would	shatter	capitalism.		The	Monetarist	Counter‐Revolution		But	that	was	also	the	problem.	The	success	of	Keynesian	‘demand	management’	meant	that	capitalists	were	no	 longer	in	the	driver’s	seat.	 If	 they	misbehaved	–	either	by	not	 investing	enough	or	 by	 acting	 erratically	 –	 governments	 could	 step	 in	 and	 fix	 things	 up.	Worst	 still,	Keynesian	policymaking	could	be	pitted	against	 the	capitalists,	particularly	 through	higher	corporate	tax	rates	and	progressive	personal	taxation.	This	is	exactly	what	happened	in	the	United	States	after	the	Second	World	War,	with	the	result	being	that	the	national	income	share	of	corporations	stagnated	and	the	distribution	of	personal	income	became	more	equal.		In	 short,	Keynes	had	 to	be	undone,	and	 this	 is	where	Milton	Friedman	and	his	monetarist	counter‐revolution	came	into	the	picture.	Monetarism	–	and	the	new‐classical	macroeconomic	theories	that	developed	in	its	wake	–	claims	that	the	pre‐1930s	neoclassicists	had	it	right	all	along.	There	were	only	two	little	things	missing	from	their	framework:	(1)	the	natural	rate	of	unemployment	and	(2)	expectations.			The	natural	rate	of	unemployment	is	like	the	Emperor’s	New	Clothes:	only	the	monetarists	and	the	new‐classicists	can	see	it.	For	the	old,	pre‐1930s	economists,	the	basic	rule	was	‘what	you	see	is	what	you	get’.	If	the	statistics	said	that	unemployment	was	zero	or	oscillating	close	to	zero,	then	the	economy	must	be	functioning	as	well	as	it	should.	Alternatively,	if	the	statistics	said	 that	unemployment	was	stuck	at	over	20	per	cent	–	as	was	 the	case	during	 the	Great	Depression	–	 then	 the	 theory,	which	predicted	 that	unemployment	should	quickly	decline,	must	be	wrong.			Not	so	for	the	monetarists	and	new‐classical	economists.	Appearances	can	be	very	deceiving,	they	warn	us;	particularly	if	you	are	unversed	in	new‐classical	monetarism.	But	those	who	can	see	the	emperor’s	new	clothes	know	better.	They	know	that,	in	fact,	most	unemployment	is	not	unemployment	at	all.	It	consists	of	people	looking	for	better	jobs,	people	upgrading	their	skills,	or	people	who	are	temporarily	caught	in	the	friction	of	blessed	technical	change.	This	                                                            2	Friedman	held	onto	both	ends	of	the	stick.	‘In	some	sense’,	he	wrote	(1968a:	15),	‘we	are	all	Keynesians	now;	in	another,	no	one	is	a	Keynesian	any	longer.	We	all	use	the	Keynesian	language	and	apparatus;	none	of	us	any	longer	 accepts	 the	 initial	 Keynesian	 conclusions’.	 Nixon	 was	 less	 subtle,	 announcing	 that	 he	 was	 ‘now	 a	Keynesian	in	economics’	(Anonymous	1971).	  120  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?unemployment	–	whose	precise	magnitude	can	change	with	circumstances	–	is	part	and	parcel	of	a	vibrant,	ever‐changing	capitalism.	It	is	natural	and	therefore	desirable;	and	things	that	are	natural	and	desirable	should	not	be	messed	with	by	government.3			Government	policy	can	reduce	unemployment	below	its	natural	rate	–	but	only	by	cheating.	In	terms	of	Equation	1,	the	monetarist	position	is	that,	if	economic	agents	have	full	information	and	act	rationally,	the	government	can	only	affect	prices	(P).	It	cannot	affect	the	real	economy	(Q).	Unfortunately,	though,	information	is	not	always	fully	available	and	agents	sometimes	act	irrationally,	so	there	is	always	the	temptation	for	government	to	try	to	fool	them	in	order	to	reduce	their	unemployment	below	its	natural	rate.			The	 ‘efficacy	 of	 fooling’	 (our	 term)	 depends	 on	 expectations.	 In	 Friedman’s	 naïve	 version	(1968b,	1977),	expectations	adapt	only	slowly,	so	unemployment	can	be	reduced	below	its	natural	rate	for	a	certain	period	–	although	there	is	always	a	price	to	pay.	Eventually,	agents	smarten	up;	and	when	they	do,	Equation	1	ascertains	that	the	entire	policy	boost	(through	a	higher	Y)	ends	up	raising	prices	(P).	In	later	versions,	such	as	those	of	Robert	Lucas	(1972;	1973;	1978)	and	Thomas	Sargent	(1973),	expectations	are	rational,	so	expansionary	policy	cannot	affect	the	real	economy	(Q)	even	in	the	short	run	and	is	immediately	translated	into	higher	 inflation	 (by	 raising	 P).	 A	 more	 recent	 instalment	 of	 this	 logic,	 issued	 by	 Edward	Prescott	and	Finn	Kydland	(1982),	suggests	that	the	entire	business	cycle	is	a	natural,	supply‐side	process	and	therefore	impervious	to	Keynesian	demand	policy	to	start	with.		Friedman,	Phelps,	Lucas,	Sargent,	Kydland	and	Prescott	all	won	Nobel	Memorial	Prizes,	and	for	a	good	reason:	they	managed	to	undo	Keynes.	They	created	a	new	dogma	that	states	not	only	that	macroeconomic	policy	cannot	affect	the	real	economy,	but,	more	importantly,	that	the	real	economy	does	not	need	to	be	affected	in	the	first	place.	In	their	laissez	faire	economy,	the	rate	of	unemployment	will	settle	at	its	natural	rate,	whether	it	is	6,	8	or	20	per	cent.	The	                                                            3	The	language	is	definitive.	According	to	Nobel	Memorial	Prize	winner	Milton	Friedman	(1968b:	8),	 ‘At	any	moment	 of	 time	 there	 is	 some	 level	 of	 unemployment	 which	 has	 the	 property	 that	 it	 is	 consistent	 with	equilibrium	in	the	structure	of	real	wage	rates.	.	.	.	The	“natural	rate	of	unemployment”,	in	other	words,	is	the	level	that	would	be	ground	out	by	the	Walrasian	system	of	general	equilibrium	equations,	provided	there	is	embedded	in	them	the	actual	structural	characteristics	of	the	labor	and	commodity	markets,	including	market	imperfections,	 stochastic	 variability	 in	 demands	 and	 supplies,	 the	 cost	 of	 gathering	 information	 about	 job	vacancies	 and	 labor	 availability,	 the	 costs	 of	mobility,	 and	 so	 on’.	 For	 Edmund	Phelps,	 another	Nobelist	 of	monetarist	repute,	a	certain	rate	of	unemployment	is	not	only	‘natural’	but	also	desirable	(provided	it	excludes	tenured	professors,	of	course).	In	his	expert	opinion,	most	of	the	so‐called	unemployed	are	merely	‘searching’	for	a	better	job.	‘It	would	be	as	senselessly	puritanical	to	wipe	out	unemployment	as	it	would	be	to	raise	taxes	in	a	deep	depression’.	There	is	nothing	to	worry	about,	he	concludes.	On	the	contrary:	‘Today’s	unemployment	is	an	investment	in	a	better	allocation	of	any	given	quantity	of	employed	persons	tomorrow’	(1970:	17).	The	very	 same	 point	 was	 reiterated	 by	 another	 monetarist	 of	 Nobelistic	 repute,	 Robert	 Lucas:	 ‘When	we	 are	unemployed’,	he	observed,	‘it	is	because	we	think	we	can	do	better’	(interviewed	by	Snowdon	and	Vane	2005:	290,	 emphases	 added).	And	 that	must	 be	 true.	 After	 all,	 it	 is	well	 known	 that	whenever	 Phelps	 and	 Lucas	invested	in	their	own	unemployment,	they	always	ended	up	making	a	bundle.	  121  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?only	thing	the	government	should	do	is	keep	prices	stable	over	the	longer	haul,	by	letting	the	money	supply	grow	at	the	same	rate	as	the	long‐term	growth	of	the	real	economy.		This	was	the	dogma	in	2008.		And	then	came	the	stock	market	crash	and	the	Great	Recession.	Protected	by	academic	tenure	and	 heavy	 subsidization,	 the	 economics	 profession	 has	 remained	 largely	 unfazed,	 but	 the	policymakers	have	panicked,	in	unison.	Within	a	few	years,	they	have	lost	all	confidence	in	their	 own	 dogma.	 Instead	 of	 sitting	 tight	 and	 letting	 the	 market	 ‘fix	 itself’,	 they	 have	‘intervened’,	massively,	breaking	almost	every	rule	in	their	book.		Fiscal	Policy		On	the	fiscal	side,	policymakers	have	let	budget	deficits	skyrocket.	Figure	3	shows	the	budget	balance	 in	 the	 OECD	 countries,	 with	 positive	 numbers	 indicating	 a	 surplus	 and	 negative	numbers	 showing	 a	 deficit.	 We	 can	 see	 that,	 since	 the	 early	 1990s,	 with	 monetarist	neoliberalism	in	full	swing,	deficits	tended	to	shrink,	and	that	in	some	countries	they	reverted	to	small	surpluses.	But	the	first	crash	of	the	millennium,	in	2000,	reversed	that	trend,	and	in	2008,	it	was	as	if	all	hell	had	broken	loose.	The	average	OECD	government	deficit	rose	to	nearly	8	per	cent	of	GDP,	and	in	the	U.S.,	the	bastion	of	neoliberalism,	the	deficit	reached	12	per	cent.		Of	 course,	 this	 was	 not	 exactly	 a	 return	 to	 Keynesianism,	 with	 its	 emphasis	 on	 planning	through	high	taxes	and	even	higher	spending	(on	the	rise	and	decline	of	'Keynesianism'	in	the	current	 crisis,	 see	 Farrell	 and	 Quiggin	 2012).	 Instead,	 it	 was	 a	 quick‐and‐dirty,	 ‘hands‐off	intervention’,	based	mostly	on	tax	cuts	and	automatic	stabilizers.	And	as	we	can	see,	it	was	hastily	 reversed.	 In	 the	 early	 2010s,	 policymakers	 started	 to	 talk	 about	 ‘austerity’,	 ‘belt	tightening’	and	‘fiscal	cliffs’.	And	their	U‐Turn	came	not	because	their	economies	were	finally	booming	 or	 because	 the	 economists	 had	 come	 up	with	 some	 new	 theoretical	 insight,	 but	because	of	the	public	debt.				 	  122  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.netFigure	3	Government	Budget	Balance	in	the	OECD	(%	of	GDP)	1970‐2014																	 						NOTE:	Series	show	annual	data.

With	deficits	soaring	and	GDP	stagnating,	governments	had	to	borrow	massively,	causing	the	debt/GDP	ratio	to	rise	by	nearly	50	per	cent	in	only	5	years!	And	with	the	ratio	currently	exceeding	110	per	cent	–	up	from	40	per	 cent	 in	 the	1970s	–	policymakers	now	warn	us	 they	are	 running	out	of	 fiscal	ammunition.4			 	                                                            4	A	recent	scandalized	version	of	this	warning	was	issued	by	Carmen	Reinhart	and	Kenneth	Rogoff,	who	claimed	that	‘across	both	advanced	countries	and	emerging	markets,	high	debt/GDP	levels	(90	percent	and	above)	are	associated	with	notably	lower	growth	outcomes’	(Reinhart	and	Rogoff	2010:	577).	Coming	from	top	pundits,	this	 warning	 was	 happily	 leveraged	 in	 support	 of	 austerity	 measures,	 until	 a	 group	 of	 University	 of	Massachusetts	 economists	 showed	 it	 to	 be	 based	 on	 faulty	 Excel	 sheet	 calculations.	 Once	 corrected,	 the	computations	showed	debt/GDP	levels	to	have	had	no	discernable	impact	on	growth	(Herndon,	Ash,	and	Pollin	2013).	Needless	to	say,	this	correction	has	hardly	dented	the	conviction	of	the	debt	fixers.	  123  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.netFigure	4	Government	Debt	in	the	OECD	(%	of	GDP)	1969‐2014																						NOTE:	Series	show	annual	data.

Monetary	Policy		The	situation	with	monetary	policy	 looks	equally	demoralizing.	Until	2008,	 the	monetarist	mantra	spoke	about	fixed	‘policy	rules’	that	central	bankers	should	obey.	In	2008,	these	rules	were	thrown	out	of	the	window.	Instead	of	letting	the	money	supply	grow	at	the	same	rate	as	the	so‐called	real	economy,	central	banks	embarked	on	what	they	called	‘quantitative	easing’.	Or,	in	simpler	words,	they	began	to	print	money,	and	in	large	quantities.			This	process	is	shown	in	Figure	5.	The	graph	plots	the	monetary	base	–	which	measures	the	amount	of	notes	and	coins	in	circulation	–	in	the	United	States,	the	European	Union	and	Japan.	The	numbers	are	denominated	in	local	currencies	and	normalized	to	January	2008=100	so	they	can	be	compared	easily.			 	  124  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.netFigure	5	The	Monetary	Base	2000‐2014																						NOTE:	Series	show	monthly	data.

The	watershed	is	2008.	Before	2008,	the	expansion	of	the	money	supply	was	relatively	orderly,	particularly	 in	 the	European	Union	and	 the	United	States.	This	pattern	changed	drastically	after	the	crash,	with	the	United	States	 leading	the	way.	Since	2008,	the	U.S.	Fed	has	nearly	quintupled	 the	 money	 supply.	 The	 European	 Central	 Bank	 quickly	 followed	 –	 though	compared	to	the	American	‘bull	in	a	china	store’,	it	trod	carefully,	choosing	fine‐tuning	over	indiscriminate	printing.	The	Japanese,	who	were	first	to	toy	with	this	policy	in	the	early	2000s,	are	only	now	re‐joining	the	bandwagon:	in	early	2013	they	announced	plans	to	double	their	monetary	base	in	two	years,	a	target	they	are	soon	to	achieve.		This	massive	money	printing	is	remarkable	primarily	because	it	seems	to	have	had	little	or	no	effect,	nominal	or	real.	Begin	with	the	nominal	side.	From	a	Keynesian	perspective,	the	deep	crisis	 of	 2008‐9,	 should	 have	 produced	 deflation,	while,	 from	 a	monetarist	 viewpoint,	 the	massive	 quantitative	 easing	 should	 have	 generated	 hyperinflation.	 Yet	 neither	 of	 these	  125  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.netoutcomes	has	materialized.	Over	the	past	decade,	core	inflation	in	the	developed	countries	–	that	is,	inflation	excluding	changes	in	food	and	energy	prices	–	has	remained	remarkably	stable	at	around	1‐2	per	cent.5			And	the	picture	is	equally	embarrassing	on	the	real	side.	Keynesians	had	hoped	that	making	money	 cheaper	would	boost	 investment	 and	kick‐start	 the	 economy.	However,	 that	 hasn’t	happened.	Since	the	beginning	of	the	crisis,	green‐field	investment	as	a	share	of	GDP	in	the	OECD	countries	has	plummeted	to	its	lowest	level	in	50	years:	this	share	stood	at	25	per	cent	in	the	early	1970s;	it	fell	to	21	per	cent	in	2007	and	it	currently	stands	on	18	per	cent	(World	Bank	Online).

Such	 counterfactual	 claims,	 though,	 although	appeasing	to	the	policymakers,	are	inherently	irrefutable.	  126  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?Moreover,	looking	at	Figure	6,	it	is	hard	to	see	why	Keynesians	should	have	expected	monetary	policy	to	reverse	this	downtrend.	The	chart	shows	long‐term	government	bond	yields	in	the	three	leading	OECD	countries.	These	rates	were	already	very	low	when	the	crisis	started,	and	now,	 at	 close	 to	 zero,	 they	 are	 lower	 than	 at	 any	other	 time	 since	 the	1950s.	 In	 this	 case,	printing	more	money	is	like	‘pushing	on	a	string’,	as	Keynes	reputedly	put	it.	It	should	have	little	or	no	effect	on	interest	rates	and	therefore	none	on	real	investment.			This	brief	exposition	should	make	it	clear	why	the	ruling	class	feels	bereft	of	an	intellectual	compass	 and	 why	 its	 policymakers	 admit	 that	 they	 are	 flying	 blind	 when	 stirring	 their	economies.	Their	dogma	has	collapsed.	Not	only	did	they	abandon	this	dogma	in	a	panic	when	the	2008	crisis	struck,	but	their	makeshift	solutions	have	failed	to	generate	meaningful	results,	let	alone	the	expected	ones.	Moreover,	they	seem	to	have	run	out	of	ammunition.	With	massive	debt,	 further	 fiscal	 expansion	 becomes	 impossible;	 and	 with	 interest	 rates	 close	 to	 zero,	monetary	expansion	is	useless.	Another	crisis	today	would	find	them	empty	handed.			The	Marxist	Perspective		For	 the	 Marxists,	 the	 key	 question	 is	 not	 how	 to	 bring	 about	 a	 recovery,	 but	 whether	sustained	growth	is	possible	to	begin	with.	According	to	Marx,	the	answer	to	this	question	is	negative.	Accumulation	for	him	is	rooted	in	and	generated	through	class	conflict,	and	this	conflict	makes	capitalism	inherently	unstable,	prone	to	crisis	and,	eventually,	destined	for	breakdown.		Marx	himself	did	not	offer	a	coherent	theory	of	crisis.	He	did	generate,	however,	several	key	principles	that	in	his	view	were	crucial	for	understanding	the	inherent	crisis	tendencies	of	capitalism.	These	insights	later	gave	rise	to	a	huge	Marxist	literature	on	crises,	to	which	we	cannot	do	justice	here.	Our	purpose,	rather,	is	simply	to	highlight	some	of	Marx’s	insights,	as	well	as	the	difficulties	they	give	rise	to.	We	focus	on	three	theories,	which	we	will	examine	in	turn:	(1)	the	tendency	of	the	rate	of	profit	to	fall;	(2)	the	interaction	between	the	reserve	army	of	the	unemployed	and	the	real	wage;	and	(3)	underconsumption	(for	critical	reviews	and	overviews	of	Marxist	 crisis	 theories,	 see,	 for	 example,	 Sweezy	1942:	Part	 III;	Wright	1977;	Shaikh	1978;	Weisskopf	1978,	1991;	Laibman	1999‐2000;	Agnoletto	2013).		The	Tendency	of	the	Rate	of	Profit	to	Fall		Profit	for	Marx	is	the	source	of	accumulation.	As	a	class,	capitalists	can	only	reinvest	what	they	appropriate	in	profit;	so	if	the	rate	of	profit	tends	to	fall,	so	must	the	maximum	rate	at	which	capital	can	accumulate.	Now,	according	to	Marx,	and	here	we	come	to	the	first	theory,	this	downward	tendency	is	built	into	the	very	logic	of	capitalism.			  127  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?To	see	why	this	is	so,	let	us	review	the	basic	Marxist	accounting	in	Equations	2‐8	below.	Begin	with	c,	v	and	s,	which	are	measured	in	terms	of	socially	necessary	abstract	labour	time.	If	we	denote	constant	capital	by	c,	variable	capital	by	v	and	surplus	value	by	s,	we	can	express	the	following	three	relationships.	The	organic	composition	of	capital	θ	is	the	ratio	of	c/v;	the	rate	of	surplus	value	ξ	is	the	ratio	of	s/v;	and	the	rate	of	profit	π	is	the	ratio	of	s/(c+v).	If	we	now	divide	the	numerator	and	denominator	of	the	rate	of	profit	by	v,	we	can	express	the	rate	of	profit	π	as	a	ratio	between	the	rate	of	surplus	value	ξ	and	the	organic	composition	of	capital	θ	plus	1.6		2. c	=	constant	capital	3. v	=	variable	capital	4. s	=	surplus	value	5. vc =	organic	composition	of	capital	6. vs =	rate	of	surplus	value	7. vcs =	rate	of	profit	8. 111 capitalofncompositioorganicvaluesurplusofratevcvsvcs 		This	framework,	says	Marx,	enables	us	to	understand	one	of	the	key	built‐in	limitations	of	capitalism.	Competition	compels	profit‐maximizing	capitalists	to	constantly	mechanize	their	production,	 and	 this	 relentless	process	 causes	 the	organic	 composition	 to	 rise	over	 time.	Capitalists	are	also	driven	to	raise	the	rate	of	surplus	value	(although	it	is	not	entirely	clear	why,	under	competitive	conditions,	 they	should	succeed	 in	doing	so).	 In	Marx’s	opinion	–	which	he	himself	was	never	completely	convinced	of	–	the	organic	composition	tends	to	rise,	and	 it	 tends	 to	 rise	 faster	 than	 the	 rate	 of	 surplus	 value,	 assuming	 that	 this	 rate	 trends	upward	as	well	(on	Marx's	life‐long	attempt	to	grapple	with	this	process,	see	Heinrich	2013;	for	 contesting	 views,	 see	 Heinrich	 et	 al.	 2013).	 The	 progressive	 growth	 of	 the	 organic	composition	is	offset	by	counter‐tendencies;	but	according	to	Marx,	over	the	longer‐haul	the	former	 process	 is	 stronger,	 causing	 the	 rate	 of	 profit	 to	 trend	 downward.	 Over	 time,	                                                            6	There	is	a	debate	among	Marxists	on	whether	the	proper	definition	of	C	in	these	equations	should	include	(1)	the	 entire	 stock	 of	 constant	 capital	 being	 advanced,	 or	 (2)	 only	 the	 part	 that	 is	 used	 up	 in	 producing	 the	commodity.	 In	 our	 presentation,	 we	 bypass	 this	 debate	 by	 defining	 the	 commodity	 to	 comprise	 the	 gross	national	product	and	 the	somewhat	depreciated	constant	capital	 that	 remains	at	 the	end	of	 the	production	cycle,	so	C	satisfies	both	definitions	(we	are	indebted	to	Moshé	Machover	for	reminding	us	of	this	issue).	  128  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?therefore,	 accumulation	 tends	 to	decelerate,	 crises	multiply	and	capitalism	becomes	ever	more	difficult	to	sustain.			The	problems	with	these	propositions	are	legion,	and	here	we	highlight	three	(for	a	more	detailed	account,	see	Nitzan	and	Bichler	2009a,	Chs.	6‐8).	The	first	problem	is	with	the	unit	of	 measurement.	 Labour	 values,	 which	 Marx’s	 variables	 are	 denominated	 in,	 cannot	 be	observed	or	examined	directly,	making	their	empirical	inquiry	difficult	if	not	impossible.	The	second	problem	is	that	mechanization	per	se	can	tell	us	nothing	about	labour	values.	Even	if	we	 accept	 Marx’s	 value	 scheme,	 it	 is	 entirely	 possible	 for	 technical	 change	 to	 devalue	constant	capital	faster	than	the	rate	at	which	capitalists	augment	their	‘physical	machinery’	(however	measured).	If	that	happens,	the	organic	composition	will	fall	rather	than	rise.	Third	and	finally,	for	Marx,	the	economy	is	bifurcated	into	productive	and	unproductive	activity.	The	former	produces	surplus	value,	while	the	latter	uses	it	–	yet	there	is	no	objective	basis	to	deciding	which	economic	activity	is	productive	and	which	is	not.			The	consequences	of	this	last	problem	are	illustrated	in	Figures	7	and	8,	which	pertain	to	the	United	States.	Since	labour	values	cannot	be	observed,	in	both	charts	we	assume	–	as	most	Marxists	do	in	their	empirical	analysis	–	that	these	values	are	more	or	less	equal	to	market	prices.	 Of	 course,	 if	 this	 assumption	 is	 incorrect,	 the	 estimates	 we	 present	 here	 are	meaningless.			Figure	7	takes	a	naïve	perspective.	It	is	naïve	because	in	this	chart	we	do	not	pretend	to	be	able	to	distinguish	productive	from	unproductive	labour,	and	instead	assume,	contrary	to	most	Marxists,	 that	all	 economic	 activity	 is	 productive	 of	 surplus	 value.	 The	 dashed	 line	approximates	the	organic	composition	of	capital.	It	is	estimated	by	taking	the	ratio	between	the	current	(replacement)	dollar	cost	of	all	non‐residential	fixed	assets	and	the	dollar	value	of	employee	compensation.	The	solid	line	measures	the	Marxist	rate	of	profit,	computed	as	the	 ratio	 of	 net	 operating	 surplus	 (which	 is	 net	 domestic	 product	 less	 employee	compensation)	 and	 the	 sum	 of	 the	 current	 dollar	 cost	 of	 fixed	 assets	 and	 employee	compensation.7				 	                                                            7	We	should	note	here	that	Marxists	remain	divided	on	whether	‘capital’	in	the	rate	of	profit	should	include	both	the	physical	capital	stock	and	the	wage	bill,	so	π	=	s	/	(c	+	v),	or	only	the	physical	capital	stock,	so	π	=	s	/	c.	Here	we	remain	true	to	Marx’s	original	formulation	(the	former),	although	using	the	latter	would	yield	the	same	conclusions.	For	 the	United	States,	 the	 two	rate‐of‐profit	 formulas	result	 in	different	magnitudes,	but	 these	magnitudes	correlate	tightly	in	their	long‐term	trends	and	short‐term	fluctuations.	  129  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.netNet Operating Surplus /(Fixed Assets + Labour Income)(left)Fixed Assets / Labour Income(right)Figure	7	Naïve	Marxist	Proxies	for	the	U.S.	Rate	of	Profit	and	the	Organic	Composition	of	Capital	1929‐2012																	 						NOTE:	Fixed	Assets	is	the	replacement	cost	of	private	and	governmental	net	non‐residential	fixed	assets.

Now,	on	the	face	of	it,	the	current	crisis	seems	consistent	with	Marx’s	theory.	We	can	see	that,	since	the	early	2000s,	the	organic	composition	has	risen	and	the	rate	of	profit	has	dropped.	Moreover,	this	inverse	relationship	seems	to	hold	–	at	least	cyclically	–	for	the	entire	period	since	the	1930s.			Technically,	this	inverse	cyclicality	is	not	entirely	surprising.	Since	fixed	assets	appear	in	the	numerator	of	one	ratio	(the	organic	composition)	and	the	denominator	of	the	other	(the	rate	of	profit),	their	variations	will	cause	the	two	ratios	to	move	inversely,	by	definition.		The	difficulty	with	this	figure	lies	in	the	longer‐term	trends.	The	rate	of	profit	in	the	chart	seems	 to	 trend	downward,	 in	 line	with	Marx’s	 theory.	But	 this	decline	 is	 supposed	 to	be	caused	 by	 a	 rising	 organic	 composition	 of	 capital,	whereas	 in	 the	 chart	 this	 composition	seems	to	have	fallen	over	time.	In	other	words,	the	long‐term	decline	in	the	rate	of	profit	–	  130  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?assuming	we	accept	its	definition	here	–	must	have	been	caused	by	factors	other	than	the	organic	composition	of	capital.			Now,	adherents	of	the	falling	tendency	theory	would	likely	contest	our	naïveté	here.	In	order	to	properly	compute	the	organic	composition	and	the	rate	of	profit,	they	would	argue,	we	must	 first	 differentiate	 between	 productive	 activity	 that	 produces	 surplus	 value	 and	unproductive	activity	 that	uses	 surplus	value.	This,	 though,	 is	 easier	 said	 than	done.	And	since	nobody	knows	exactly	which	labour	activity	is	productive	and	which	is	not,	Marxists	take	a	shortcut.	They	identify	entire	sectors	that	they	deem	to	be	productive	and	separate	them	from	all	other	sectors,	which	they	classify	as	unproductive	(see,	for	example,	Shaikh	and	Tonak	1994;	Carchedi	2011).			Figure	8	follows	this	standard	Marxist	practice.	It	identifies	four	sectors	as	the	productive	core	 of	 the	 U.S.	 economy:	 agriculture,	 mining,	 construction	 and	 manufacturing.8	 The	remaining	 sectors	 are	 considered	 unproductive.	 With	 this	 bifurcation,	 the	 organic	composition	of	capital	 is	calculated	not	 for	the	economy	as	a	whole,	but	only	 for	the	four	sectors	that	produce	surplus	value.	Part	of	this	surplus	value	is	appropriated	by	capitalists	in	these	productive	sectors;	the	rest	is	appropriated	by	the	capitalists	and	workers	of	the	unproductive	sectors.	To	calculate	the	overall	surplus	value	we	subtract	from	net	domestic	income	the	wage	bill	of	the	productive	sectors.9	We	then	divide	this	surplus	value	by	the	sum	of	the	fixed	assets	and	wages	of	the	productive	sectors,	to	get	the	rate	of	profit.		Now,	unlike	in	Figure	7,	in	this	chart	the	organic	composition	trends	upward,	as	it	should	–	but,	then,	so	does	the	rate	of	profit!	In	Marxist	terms,	this	relationship	means	that	there	are	counter‐tendencies	 that	 more	 than	 offset	 the	 long‐term	 impact	 of	 the	 rising	 organic	composition.	 Proponents	 of	 this	 theory	 may	 again	 contest	 that	 our	 particular	 choice	 of	productive	 and	 unproductive	 sectors	 is	 inappropriate,	 and	 maybe	 they	 are	 right.	Unfortunately,	 though,	 there	 is	 no	way	 to	 objectively	 delineate	 the	 two	 sectors,	 and	 this	inability	creates	the	temptation	to	choose	the	particular	bifurcation	whose	results	happen	to	be	consistent	with	the	theory.	Finally,	we	should	reiterate	that	(1)	we	are	using	neoclassical	price	data	rather	than	(unavailable)	Marxist	labour	values,	so	what	we	see	in	these	charts	might	have	nothing	do	with	Marx’s	theory	to	begin	with;	and	(2)	since	labour	values	remain	unknown,	 there	 is	 no	 way	 to	 know	whether	 our	 findings	 support	 or	 undermine	 Marx’s	theory.		 	                                                            8	Marxists	commonly	consider	utilities	as	a	productive	sector,	but	they	often	exclude	it	from	their	empirical	analysis	due	to	data	problems.	We	follow	this	convention	here.	9	 In	 their	 empirical	 analyses,	 some	Marxists	 do	 not	 follow	 this	 proper	method;	 instead,	 they	 approximate	surplus	value	by	subtracting	the	wage	bill	from	the	income	not	of	all	sectors,	but	of	the	productive	sectors	only	(see	for	example,	Carchedi	2011).	Because	this	computation	is	analytically	incorrect,	its	results	are	difficult	to	interpret.	  131  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.netSurplus Value /(Productive Assets + Productive Wages)(right)Productive Assets / Productive Wages(left)Figure	8	Refined	Marxist	Proxies	for	the	U.S.	Rate	of	Profit	and	the	Organic	Composition	of	Capital	1947‐2012	                       NOTE: Productive assets are estimated by the replacement cost of net fixed assets in agriculture, construction, mining and manufacturing.

The	Reserve	Army	of	the	Unemployed	and	the	Real	Wage		Another	driver	of	crisis	in	Marx	is	the	relationship	between	the	reserve	army	of	unemployed	and	the	real	wage.	For	Marx,	unemployment	is	the	regulatory	mechanism	that	ascertains	that	wages	 gravitate	 toward	 their	 subsistence	 level.	 During	 a	 boom,	 the	 bargaining	 power	 of	workers	strengthens,	so	the	real	wage	tends	to	rise	above	its	labour	value.	This	rise	squeezes	profit,	causing	capitalists	to	invest	less.	A	crisis	then	ensues,	unemployment	rises,	and	the	real	wage	is	compressed	back	to	subsistence.		  132  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.net(share of labour force, right)(annaul rate of change, left)Figure	9	U.S.	Unemployment	and	‘Real’	Wage	Growth	1930‐2014																		 						NOTE:	Series	are	shown	as	5‐year	trailing	averages.

The	chart	shows	two	series.	The	 rate	 of	 unemployment,	 represented	 by	 the	 dashed	 line,	 is	 plotted	 against	 the	 right	logarithmic	scale.	The	rate	of	change	of	the	real	wage	is	shown	by	the	solid	line	and	is	plotted	against	the	left	inverted	scale.	The	inversion	means	that	a	downward	movement	of	this	series	in	the	chart	represents	a	rise	in	the	rate	of	growth	of	the	real	wage.	Note	that	both	series	are	smoothed	as	5‐year	trailing	averages.		This	relationship,	which	does	not	depend	on	knowing	labour	values,	seems	consistent	with	the	spirit	of	Marx’s	claims	and	looks	highly	robust.	Whenever	unemployment	rises,	the	rate	of	change	of	the	real	wage	falls	–	and	vice	versa	when	unemployment	falls.	Both	series	show	a	significant	change	in	the	run‐up	to	the	current	crisis:	unemployment	fell	since	the	early	1980s,	 and	 particularly	 during	 the	 1990s,	 while	 the	 rate	 of	 change	 of	 the	 real	 wage	accelerated	in	tandem	with	this	fall.	In	light	of	these	developments,	the	crisis	of	the	2000s	could	 be	 interpreted,	 at	 least	 in	part,	 as	 a	 classical	Marxist	 backlash	 set	 in	motion	 to	 rid	capitalists	of	excessive	wages	squeezing	their	profit.	And	indeed,	since	the	onset	of	the	crisis,	the	 rate	 of	 unemployment	 has	 soared	 and	 the	 rate	 of	 growth	 of	 the	 real	wage	 has	 been	reduced	to	a	standstill.	Whether	this	process	is	the	principal	driver	of	the	crisis	of	course	is	hard	to	tell,	but	it	is	certainly	consistent	with	it.			But	 the	 connection	 to	 Marx’s	 theory	 here,	 although	 intuitively	 appealing,	 is	 ultimately	misleading.	For	Marx,	the	significance	of	the	reserve	army	lies	in	its	impact	not	on	the	rate	of	change	of	the	real	wage,	but	on	its	absolute	level.	Figure	10	examines	this	latter	impact,	and	the	picture	 it	 depicts	 is	 very	different	 from	 that	of	 Figure	9.	The	 chart	 shows	 the	 rate	of	unemployment	against	the	right	log	scale	and	the	real	wage	level	against	the	left	log	scale.	We	use	 two	 real‐wage	 series	–	 for	production	workers	 in	manufacturing	only	and	 for	all	workers	in	the	nonfarm	business	sector.	Both	series	are	expressed	as	indices.			Unlike	Figure	9,	this	chart	seems	to	present	an	anomaly.	We	can	see	that,	as	Marx	might	have	expected,	the	level	of	real	wages	moved	inversely	with	unemployment	till	the	early	1940s	–	yet,	 from	 then	 onward,	 the	 relationship	 inverted.	 Unemployment	 started	 to	 rise	 and	continued	 to	 do	 so	 till	 the	 early	 1980s;	 but	 the	 real	 wage,	 instead	 of	 falling	 or	 at	 least	stagnating,	 rose	 in	 tandem.	Moreover,	when	 unemployment	 stopped	 rising	 and	 even	 fell	during	the	1990s,	the	real	wage,	instead	of	rising,	stagnated.	From	this	viewpoint,	the	reserve	army	of	 the	 unemployed	no	 longer	 seems	 to	 play	 the	 role	 that	Marx	 allotted	 to	 it	 in	 the	nineteenth	century,	at	least	not	in	any	evident	way.	Compared	to	the	earlier	postwar	era,	the	real	wage	during	the	1990s	and	2000s	has	hardly	changed,	so	it	is	difficult	to	see	it	as	a	‘profit	squeezing’	factor	underlying	the	current	crisis.			 	  134  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.net(share of labour force, right)(manufacturing, left)(nonfarm business, left)Figure	10	U.S.	Unemployment	and	the	‘Real’	Wage	Rate	1920‐2013																	 						NOTE:	The	‘real’	hourly	wage	is	the	nominal	hourly	wage	rate	divided	by	the	implicit	GDP	deflator	and	expressed	as	an	index.

Unlike	 the	 theory	 of	 the	 falling	tendency	of	the	rate	of	profit,	which	emphasizes	the	limits	on	the	production	of	surplus	value,	underconsumption	 deals	with	 the	 limits	 on	 the	 realization	 of	 surplus	 value.	 The	 starting	point	is	the	more	or	less	universal	fact	that	workers,	because	of	their	lower	income,	spend	most	if	not	all	of	that	income	on	consumption.	By	contrast,	capitalists,	whose	income	is	much	higher,	can	afford	–	and	are	compelled	by	their	social	role	as	capitalists	–	to	save	most	of	it.	So,	 all	 else	 remaining	 the	 same,	 an	 upward	 redistribution	 of	 income	 from	 workers	 to	capitalists	will	tend	to	reduce	the	average	share	of	consumption	in	aggregate	spending.	The	consequence	 of	 this	 reduction,	 say	 the	 underconsumptionists,	 is	 a	 glut	 of	 unsold	commodities,	 lower	 prices	 and	 lower	 profit.	 And	 since	 falling	 profit	 tends	 to	 lower	investment	spending,	we	end	up	with	a	generalized	‘realization	crisis’.		Until	 the	early	twentieth	century,	 this	view	was	not	particularly	popular	among	Marxists,	partly	because	Marx	himself	seemed	rather	ambivalent	about	 it.	But	the	rise	of	European	imperialism	in	the	latter	half	of	the	nineteenth	century,	the	Great	Depression	of	the	1930s,	and	the	militarized	boom	of	 the	Second	World	War	changed	this	attitude.	Following	 John	Hobson’s	pioneering	work	on	Imperialism	(1902),	Marxists	started	to	seriously	contemplate	the	 significance	 of	 realization	 for	 capitalist	 crisis	 (Hilferding	 1910;	 Luxemburg	 1913;	Kautsky	 1914;	 Lenin	 1917).	 And	 with	 Keynes’	 emphasis	 on	 deficient	 demand,	 Marxist	underconsumption	theories	enjoyed	a	significant	revival	(for	a	critical	analysis,	see	Bichler	and	Nitzan	2012c).			The	most	innovative	contributor	to	this	literature	was	the	Polish	political	economist	Michal	Kalecki	(for	a	posthumous	edited	collection,	see	Kalecki	1971).	Writing	in	the	early	1930s,	Kalecki	developed	a	class‐based	micro‐macro	model	that	anticipated	and,	in	some	important	sense,	went	beyond	Keynes.	One	of	the	key	novelties	of	Kalecki’s	model	was	the	role	played	by	the	market	structure	and	the	consequences	of	that	structure	for	the	distribution	of	income	and	the	level	of	aggregate	demand	(Kalecki	1933,	1939,	1943;	Asimakopulos	1975,	1987).	According	 to	 Kalecki,	 modern	 corporate	 structures	 tend	 to	 be	 highly	 concentrated.	 The	extent	of	this	concentration,	he	said,	can	be	measured	by	the	‘degree	of	monopoly’,	which	he	defined	as	(approximately)	equal	to	the	ratio	of	unit	profit	to	unit	price,	or	the	share	of	capital	in	national	income.	All	else	being	the	same,	he	said,	the	higher	the	degree	of	monopoly	–	and	therefore	 the	 higher	 the	 income	 share	 of	 capital	 –	 the	 lower	 the	 average	 share	 of	consumption	in	aggregate	spending,	and	hence	the	greater	the	tendency	toward	deficient	demand	and	stagnation.			Later	 on,	 this	 insight	 became	 a	 key	 theoretical	 basis	 for	 the	 Monopoly	 Capital	 School.	According	to	this	school	–	led	by	Paul	Baran	and	Paul	Sweezy	and	others	associated	with	the	  136  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?journal	Monthly	Review	 –	oligopolistic	 capitalism	 tends	 to	generate	 stagflation	and	needs	wasteful	spending	–	particularly	military	expenditures	and	financialization	–	to	offset	this	tendency	(Steindl	1952;	Tsuru	1956;	Baran	and	Sweezy	1966;	Magdoff	and	Sweezy	1983;	Foster	and	Szlajfer	1984).			Kalecki’s	argument	can	be	generalized	beyond	its	original	emphasis	on	capital	versus	labour.	If	 the	share	of	 consumption	 in	personal	 income	 is	associated	negatively	with	 the	 level	of	personal	 income,	 then	 we	 should	 expect	 personal	 or	 household	 income	 inequality,	regardless	of	its	source,	to	be	inversely	correlated	with	the	pace	of	economic	activity.			Figure	11	examines	 this	proposition	 for	 the	United	States.	The	dotted	 line	 at	 the	bottom	shows	the	income	share	of	the	top	1	per	cent	of	the	U.S.	population	(for	a	comparative	critical	assessment	of	income‐distribution	data,	see	Burkhauser	et	al.	2012).	The	solid	series	at	the	top	 of	 the	 chart	 depicts	 the	 pace	 of	 economic	 activity,	 approximated	 here	 by	 the	 rate	 of	growth	of	employment.	Note	that	we	use	employment	growth	rather	than	overall	economic	growth.	The	reason	is	that,	as	it	is	commonly	measured,	overall	growth	is	affected	by	both	employment	 and	 productivity	 growth,	 but	 only	 the	 former	 responds	 directly	 to	underconsumption.	Both	series	are	smoothed	as	10‐year	trailing	averages.		The	 relationship	 shown	 in	 the	 figure	 is	 rather	 remarkable.	We	 can	discern	 three	distinct	periods,	 indicated	by	the	dashed,	 freely	drawn	line	going	through	the	employment	series.	The	 first	 period,	 from	 the	 turn	 of	 the	 century	 till	 the	 1930s,	 is	 the	 so‐called	 Gilded	 Age.	Income	 inequality	 is	 rising	 (at	 least	 during	 the	 period	 for	which	 data	 are	 available)	 and	employment	growth	is	plummeting.			The	 second	 period,	 from	 the	 Great	 Depression	 till	 the	 early	 1980s,	 is	 marked	 by	 the	Keynesian	 welfare‐warfare	 state.	 Higher	 taxation	 and	 spending	 make	 distribution	 more	equal,	while	employment	growth	accelerates.	Note	the	massive	acceleration	of	employment	growth	during	the	Second	World	War	and	its	subsequent	deceleration	brought	by	postwar	demobilization.	Obviously	 these	dramatic	movements	are	unrelated	 to	 income	inequality,	but	they	do	not	alter	the	series’	overall	upward	trend.			The	third	period,	from	the	early	1980s	to	the	present,	is	marked	by	neoliberalism.	In	this	period,	 monetarism	 assumes	 the	 commanding	 heights,	 inequality	 starts	 to	 soar,	 and	employment	growth	plummets.	The	current	rate	of	employment	growth	hovers	around	zero	while	 the	 top	1	per	cent	appropriates	20	per	cent	of	all	 income	–	similar	 to	 the	numbers	recorded	during	the	Great	Depression.				 	  137  CAN	CAPITALISTS	AFFORD	RECOVERY?www.bnarchives.net(annual rate of change, left)(level, right)Figure	11	U.S.	Income	Distribution	and	Employment	Growth	1900‐2014																	 						NOTE:	Series
