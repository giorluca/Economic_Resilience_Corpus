ABSTRACT 
A significant amount of energy gets lost through the exhaust of simple gas turbine plants, more 
often than not, this energy can be used to run another power cycle or a combined heat and power 
setup, leading to an increase in the overall efficiency of the plant, reduce air pollution and energy 
wastage. In this study, a retrofitted performance analysis of incorporating a steam power cycle to 
the existing gas turbine cycle in Delta IV power station is carried out, the analysis is carried out 
using first law of thermodynamics and energy cost comparison to describe the effect of combining 
both cycles on power output, thermal efficiency and energy cost. Operating data were obtained 
from existing gas thermal plant in Ughelli (Delta IV) and steam thermal plant in Lagos (Egbin). 
Preliminary assessment shows that power output increases by a further 51.5MW, thus raising the 
overall combined efficiency to 41.85%. Analysis on cost savings accruable from incorporating a 
heat recovery steam generation was also done and significant savings in cost was obtained.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The worlds increasing population and rapid 
industrialization requires sustainable energy supply 
which is crucial for development. Climate concerns 
requires that clean, climate friendly and affordable 
energy technologies be deployed in harnessing it [1]. 
Growing concerns and challenges in the fossil fuel 
industry and due to recent advancements in energy 
sustainable systems, the combined cycle arrangement 
is attracting lots of research interest, as it is regarded 
as the most efficient energy conversion system in 
addition to significantly reducing emissions and 
energy wastage [2]. 
 The combined cycle power plant is the arrangement 
of a gas turbine with a steam bottoming cycle, the 
basic principle entails powering the gas turbine by 
burning gas fuel by a coupled generator, the high 
temperature exhaust gas is recovered in a heat 
recovery steam generator (HRSG) which is then used 
to produce steam for the steam power cycle, which 
then produces additional power. Combined cycle 
plants are known to be more efficient than 
conventional single generating plants with efficiencies 
as high as 60% in some cases [3]  
The installation of heat recovery steam generator 
(HRSG) and steam power plant equipment to achieve 
a combined cycle configuration is a more attractive 
option since it does not require modification of the 
existing gas turbine and the construction of the steam 
power plant will not interfere with the operation of the 
turbine resulting in minimum plant downtime and loss 
in productive capacity. 
A number of authors have researched on combined 
cycle arrangement and performance improvement 
options. Khan, et al [4] carried out thermodynamic 
analysis to investigate new advancements of high 
performance for combined cycle power plants, their 
study used parametric analysis to optimize the 
performance of the combined cycle arrangement 
which included a bypass valve, the result obtained 
showed a 45% gain in power output when the inlet 
temperature of the topping cycle increases from 
1000K to 1400K, Lacopo, et al [4] also used 
thermodynamic analysis to investigate the most

efficient match for a vapour cycle bottoming cycle 
using the 2nd law of thermodynamics, results showed 
a 12% increase in efficiency of the vapour cycle. 
Bianchi, et al [5] and Zhu, et al [6] studied the 
possibility of using the waste heat from gas turbine 
plants to power a bottoming cycle, Macian, et al [7] 
went on to develop optimization options of bottoming 
cycle which can then be used in waste heat recovery 
systems in vehicles. Polyzakis, et al [8] carried out 
optimization of combined cycle reheat arrangement, 
results indicating that the reheated gas turbines are 
the most viable option. Xiang, et al [9] studied 
performance improvement and optimization of 
selected combined cycle power plants in china, the 
results obtained from the study shows that increasing 
the HRSG inlet temperature beyond 5900C does not 
significantly improve cycle efficiency and with HRSG 
optimization with the use of gas to gas heat 
recuperation increases the combined cycle efficiency 
to 59%.  
The gas turbine exhaust, typically at a temperature of 
500-600°C [10] is used to raise steam in the HRSG; 
this steam is then used in steam turbine to drive a 
generator. The turbine exhaust has unused oxygen 
content and it is possible to burn additional fuel in the 
boiler to raise steam output; this supplementary firing 
is most used with gas turbine operating at a relatively 
low exhaust gas temperature [11]. The exhaust from 
the HRSG may be used in processes such as paper 
drying, brewing, heating of building, sterilizing or for 
preheating combustion air for the furnace at a carbon 
baking facility, this is referred to as Cogeneration or 
combined Heat and Power (CHP). Zhang, et al [12] 
and Peris, et al [13] carried out studies on utilizing the 
waste heat from internal combustion engines, both 
papers show that power output improved marginally 
when heat recovery was incorporated.   
 
2. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
The combined cycle arrangement is the combination 
of two cycle with the primary aim of improving work 
output and overall efficiency, the primary cycle, 
termed the topping cycle is the gas power cycle 
working on the principle of the Brayton cycle, its high-
quality exhaust heat is used to run the second cycle, 
termed the bottoming cycle which in this case is the 
steam power cycle working on the principle of the 
Rankine cycle. The working fluid of the topping cycle 
is combustible gases while that of the bottoming cycle 
is steam. The gas turbine plant to be used for this 
analysis is the Delta IV Power Station, Ughelli while 
the steam power plant used is the Egbin Power 
Station, Ikorodu. 
In the gas turbine (topping) cycle, air at atmospheric 
pressure and temperature (p5, T5) enters the 
compressor, where it is compressed to higher 
pressure and temperature (p6, T6). This high pressure 
and temperature air enter the combustion chamber 
where fuel gas is added in the combustion process. 
After leaving the combustion chamber, the products 
of combustion at pressure and temperature (p6, T7) 
enters the turbine where it expands to the 
temperature T8. On leaving the turbine, the quality of 
the exhaust gases is still significantly high as well as 
the amount of energy in the gasses. Such gases if 
allowed to exhaust in to the environment (as currently 
the case in Delta IV), they will contribute to global 
warming. 
In order to extract this energy and save the plant, a 
heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) is installed in 
the exhaust channel, after which the gases exhaust to 
the atmosphere at temperature T9. The HRSG acts as 
the combustion chamber for the bottoming cycle. 
In the bottoming (steam power) cycle, condensed 
feed water enters the pump at state 1 (p1) where it is 
pumped to higher pressure and temperature (p2, T2) 
before entering the HRSG where superheated steam 
is generated at (p3, T3), before entering the turbine 
where it is expanded to the condenser conditions of 
p4. Figure 1 shows the schematic of the proposed 
combined cycle arrangement and its corresponding T-
s diagram. 
Although the characteristics compactness of the gas 
turbine is sacrificed in binary cycle plants the 
efficiency is much higher than is obtainable with the 
simple cycle such that turbines are now widely used 
for large scale electricity generating stations [14] 
 
3.1 Thermodynamic analysis of Gas Power 
Cycle (Delta IV) 
In the gas turbine topping cycle, data used in 
computing the work output and thermal efficiency

is given by:

3.2 Thermodynamic analysis of the HRSG 
A single pressure HRSG is installed to replace the 
boiler in the steam power plant. The HRSG is expected 
to reduce the exhaust gas temperature of the gas 
power cycle before it exhausts to the atmosphere 
while generating superheated steam for the steam 
power plant operation.

station by Ohenhen [15]. Using the states in Figure 1, 
the turbine work (Wts) in the steam power cycle is 
given by:

turbine (topping) and steam turbine (bottoming) 
cycles as shown in Figure 1. The combination

for which Power Station operation data is available) 
 
5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
The network output of the power stations when 
operating individually and when combined in a 
combined cycle set up is shown in Figure 2.  
The Thermal efficiencies of the power stations when 
operating individually and when combined in a 
combined cycle set up is shown in Figure 3. 
As seen from Figure 2, the installation of a combined 
cycle arrangement instead of the existing individual 
gas and steam power plants creates a considerable 
increase in power output from the individual 89.9MW 
and 53.6MW for the gas and steam plants respectively 
to the 143.5MW for the combined cycle, also from 
Figure 3 the same appreciable gain in thermal 
efficiency is noticed from the 24.4% for the gas 
turbine cycle to the 37.9% for the combined cycle 
power plant. 
A further comparison of Figure 2 and 3, shows that 
although the power output of the steam cycle is less 
than that of the gas cycle, the efficiency of the steam 
is much higher than that of the gas, this is due to the 
far less heat supplied in the steam cycle due to the 
presence of air preheaters and economizers in the 
boiler pathway in the steam turbine. 
The considerable gain in power output and thermal 
efficiency noticed in Figures 2 and 3 makes the 
combined cycle plant suitable for base load power 
generation due to reduced cost of generation. To 
avoid having one steam turbine train for each gas 
turbine unit, it is more economical to have two gas 
turbines and HRSG to drive one steam turbine train as 
used in the design of the AGIP power installation in 
Kwale, Delta State. In such instance, the power output 
from the steam power output from the steam turbine 
generator terminal would be greatly increased.

Assume all five GTs are working as Gt 15, total energy

Total cost of fuel for GT 15 = N575.7 × 1308725 = 
N735.4 million 
 
Assume all five GTs are working as GT 15, total energy 
generated by station:  
1308725 × 6 = 7 852 350 MWh 
Total cost of fuel for GTs in station: 575.7 × 7852350 
= N4.52 billion 
 
5.3 Saving in Fuel Cost by Using A Combined 
Cycle 
Saving in cost of fuel per GT = N800.8 million - 
N735.3million = N47.5million 
Savings in cost of fuel for station = N4.8 billion - N4.52 
billion = N280 million 
As seen from the above hypothetical combined cycle 
scheme a considerable increase in power output 
production is achieved at a much higher efficiency, the 
use of supplementary firing would increase cost of 
fueling but gives much higher output from the steam 
turbine generator terminal, then the advantage of a 
further increase in output to be gained from combined 
cycle arrangement would have to be weighed against 
the increased cost of fueling. 
 
6. CONCLUSION 
A thermodynamic analysis for incorporating a steam 
turbine plant and a gas turbine plant in a combined 
cycle arrangement using a heat recovery steam 
generator has been explored and a performance 
evaluation and cost analysis has been efficiently 
applied. The results improve the understanding of 
such combined cycle behaviors, revealing that the 
combined cycle plant provides a much higher load 
output, significant improvement in efficiency, and 
even though there is a greater complexity in the plant 
and a higher cost of equipment, there is considerable 
reduction in the fuel cost. 
The possibility of incorporating a steam turbine unit to 
utilize the high exhaust gas from the gas turbine unit 
(combined cycle) was studied: the findings reveal a 
much higher load output, improved efficiency and 
reduced fuel cost.
