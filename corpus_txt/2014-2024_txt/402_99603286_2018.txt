ABSTRACT 
 
 
 
A TECHNO-ECONOMIC STUDY ON THE WASTE HEAT RECOVERY OPTIONS FOR 
WET COOLED NATURAL GAS COMBINED CYCLE POWER PLANTS 
 
 
Increasing ambient temperature is known to have negative impacts on the performance of 
gas turbine and combined cycle power plants. There have been multiple approaches to mitigate 
this performance reduction. One such method involves cooling of the gas turbine inlet air.  There 
are several different commercial techniques available, but they are energy intensive and require 
large capital investments. One potential option for cost reduction is to recover the waste heat 
emanating from the power plants to operate thermally activated cooling systems to cool the turbine 
inlet air. In this study, a 565 MW natural gas combined cycle power plant subjected to different 
waste heat recovery scenarios and gas turbine inlet chilling is assessed. A simplified 
thermodynamic and heat transfer model is developed to predict the performance of an 
evaporatively cooled NGCC power plant at varying ambient conditions. By taking typical 
meteorological year (TMY3) hourly weather data for two different locations – Los Angeles, 
California and Houston, Texas – the yearly output for this plant is predicted at a 100% capacity 
factor. The feasibilities of different waste heat recovery (WHR) systems including a gas turbine 
exhaust driven absorption chiller, a flue gas driven absorption chiller, a steam driven absorption 
chiller, and an electrically driven vapor compression chiller are assessed by calculating the 
Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for each scenario. In each of these cases, a parametric 
analysis was performed on the COP and the costs ($ per kWth) of the system. In these cases, the 
COP was varied from 0.2 to 2.0 (increments of 0.2), whereas the costs were varied logarithmically 
iii 
 
from $10 to $10,000 per kWth. The results of the analysis showed that for a fixed WHR system 
cost (i.e., $ per kWth), the system powered by flue gas generated the lowest LCOE, followed by 
the electrically-driven vapor compression chiller, steam-heated chiller, and finally, the gas turbine 
exhaust driven chiller for both geographic locations at all COP combinations. The analysis also 
investigated the impact of fixed investment cost, and the flue gas system again yielded the smallest 
LCOE and yielded a lower LCOE than the baseline case (no WHR) over a wide range of COPs.  
The maximum costs each of these systems could tolerate before the LCOE is higher than the 
baseline case was also determined. The flue gas driven absorption system had the highest tolerable 
costs at all COP combinations, followed by the vapor compression, steam, and gas turbine exhaust 
driven systems. As such, the flue gas powered system was identified as the most economic system 
to reduce the LCOE from the baseline case for a wide range of COP combinations at high tolerable 
costs for these two locations.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1 Background 
The electricity generation sector in the United States (U.S.) is primarily dominated by fossil 
fuel electricity generation.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates, in 2016, 
about 4.08 trillion kWh of electricity were generated at utility-scale facilities in the U.S [5].  About 
65% of this generation was from fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases), about 
20% was from nuclear energy, and about 15% was from renewable energy sources. Clearly fossil 
fuel electricity generation has been dominating the industry since the very start, and only recently 
have renewable energy technologies started to gain significant share in total electricity generation. 
For example, U.S. renewable energy consumption grew by 6 percent, from 7.600 quadrillion Btu 
in 2009 to 8.090 quadrillion Btu in 2010. The relative share of renewable energy to total energy 
consumption has grown to 8 percent in 2010[6]. However, natural gas electricity generation 
constitutes about 33.8% of the total generation, whereas coal accounts for about 30.4% [5]. As of 
July 2017, about 54% of the electricity from natural gas-fired capacity came from natural gas 
combined cycle (NGCC) power plants [7].  
Many traditional fossil-fuel fired power plants have efficiencies in the range of 30 to 40 
percent, but NGCC power plants are able to meet efficiencies of 50 to 60 percent [8]. Also known 
as Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) power plants, these plants can achieve such high thermal 
efficiencies through heat recovery steam generation and a bottoming Rankine cycle.  Although the 
efficiencies for NGCC power plants are high compared to other systems, the plants still lose 40 to 
50 percent of their energy during the power generation process. The majority of heat losses occur 
in the condenser, where steam is condensed to resupply boiler feed water of the power plant. The 
plant also loses energy through the flue gas exhaust because the gas exits to the atmosphere from 
2 
 
the stack at a temperature higher than ambient (~80-150°C). This heat loss also accounts for the 
total heat losses that occur in the power plant. The efficiency of a typical gas turbine unit is 40%, 
while the efficiency of the steam cycle operating under a combined cycle is around 30%. For these 
efficiency numbers, nearly 60% of heat input to the gas turbine cycle is wasted in a simple cycle 
unit. However, for a combined cycle, nearly 70% of the exhaust heat from the gas turbine cycle is 
wasted [9]. These losses are form turbomachine performance, heat loss through flue gas, and 
generator losses. One opportunity to improve power plant efficiency is to use this low-grade waste 
heat as a heat input for other low-grade heat driven systems. Multiple research studies have been 
performed in the waste heat recovery (WHR) systems that can potentially increase the overall 
efficiency of the power plant. One potential use of the low-grade waste heat is to utilize a heat 
powered cooling system to chill the power plant gas turbine inlet air. Recently, many investigations 
have focused on enhancing power plant efficiency. Particularly in middle-eastern countries where 
the ambient temperature is high, gas turbine inlet chilling is practiced widely because increasing 
ambient temperatures have negative impacts on the performance and the efficiency of the NGCC 
power plants. Another potential use of waste heat driven systems can be the reduction of dry 
cooling load for dry cooled power plants because the heat is utilized in a process instead. More 
discussions are made in the literature review sections.  
1.2 Motivation and Objectives 
Most NGCC power plants are designed to operate at the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) ambient conditions (15°C dry bulb temperature, 101.325 kPa barometric 
pressure and 0.6 relative humidity)[10]. However, at higher ambient temperatures, the 
performance of the power plant and the efficiency degrade such that there is a loss in total MWh 
produced, and, therefore, revenue generated by the power producers. The increased ambient 
3 
 
temperatures decrease the plant power output due to the change in air density at the NGCC 
compressor inlet. The increase in ambient temperature decreases the gas density, so the mass flow 
rate of air entering the compressor of the gas turbine also decreases. Figure 1-1 shows there is a 
reduction of nearly 18% in the power output of the gas turbine as the ambient temperature reaches 
40°C from the ISO conditions.  More details on the gas turbine losses are discussed in section 3.1. 
Due to the reduced inlet mass flow, the exhaust mass flow from the gas turbine cycle also 
decreases, causing a subsequent power reduction in the bottoming Rankine cycle. Additionally, 
for wet cooled power plants, cooling tower performance is highly dependent on ambient 
temperature and relative humidity. At high ambient temperatures and relative humidity, the 
inability of the cooling tower to produce cooling water same as that at baseline case will have a 
negative impact on the condenser operating pressure and temperature. There must be a 
corresponding increase in the condenser saturation pressure to accommodate any increase in the 
cooling water temperatures. The increase in saturation pressure is propagated to the low pressure 
steam turbine connected upstream of the condenser, and results in an increase in the turbine back 
pressure and a reduction in the turbine power output. The reduction in the power output can be in 
 
Figure 1-1. Effect of ambient temperature on gas 
turbine performance [4]. 
 
 
4 
 
the range to 17% to 20% when the ambient temperature is increased to 40°C from 15°C[11]. With 
all these negative effects, there is a significant amount of power loss from the NGCC power plant 
at high ambient temperatures and relative humidity conditions. All these effects should be 
quantified to accurately predict the overall performance of the NGCC power plant at any given 
ambient conditions. Furthermore, the power plant economics are also affected due to power 
generation change, which has a direct impact on the revenue generated by the power producers. 
Hence, this study is primarily motivated to quantify these losses in terms of power plant economics 
and to analyze the potential benefits of the WHR strategies utilized specifically for chilling the gas 
turbine inlet air.  
The major objective of the present study is to perform a techno-economic study on waste 
heat recovery strategies used for gas turbine inlet chilling in a wet cooled natural gas combined 
cycle power plant application. To complete this major objective, several specific objectives are 
achieved, and are listed as follows: 
1. Model a gas turbine cycle and bottoming Rankine cycle of a standard NGCC power plant 
to predict the performance at any given ambient temperature and pressure.  
2. Model a mechanical wet cooling tower to predict the cooling water temperatures at any 
given ambient temperature and relative humidity conditions and couple it with the NGCC 
model generated in specific objective 1.  
3. Use Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3) data for two representative locations (in this 
study—Los Angeles, California and Houston, Texas) to predict the hourly performance 
and efficiency of the plant for a one year period.  
4. Generate a financial model to calculate the Levelized cost of Electricity (LCOE) for the 
power plant based on plant costs and the revenue generated. Use the hourly output and 
5 
 
efficiency of the power plant as predicted in specific objective 3. 
5. Modify the NGCC model created in specific objectives 1 and 2 to accommodate three 
different waste heat recovery schemes (gas turbine exhaust, steam and flue gas) in addition 
to an electrically driven vapor compression system and calculate the performance 
output/efficiency for each scenarios.  
6. Predict the LCOE for the different WHR schemes and for the electrically driven vapor 
compression system for two locations. Determine the most optimal system based on 
investments, tolerable costs and calculated LCOE. 
1.3 Thesis Organization 
In the following chapters, this thesis describes the motivation, modeling approach, and 
results for waste heat recovery scenarios in a NGCC power plant application. A detailed literature 
review is presented in chapter 2 which consists of four subsections. The first subsection discusses 
the operational characteristics and current state of U.S. NGCC power plants. This also discusses 
the off-design performance prediction approaches found in the literature. These approaches are 
used to predict the NGCC power plants performance at different ambient operating conditions. 
The two subsections after that discuss the extent waste heat recovery options that have been 
investigated for gas turbine inlet chilling, and the associated economics of the presented options. 
The final subsection outlines the research needs and motivation for this study. Chapter 3 presents 
the details of the simplified thermodynamic and heat transfer model developed to predict the 
performance of the NGCC power plant.  Chapter 3 also includes the mechanical wet cooling tower 
modeling approach and presents the detailed financial modeling approach developed to calculate 
the LCOE of the power plant. The gas turbine inlet chilling options and WHR scenarios specific 
to the two given locations are also discussed in this chapter as well. Results of the analysis are 
6 
 
summarized and discussed in chapter 4. Lastly, chapter 5 presents the conclusions of the present 
study and proposes future recommendations for the best suitable waste heat recovery options and 
improvements that can be made in future studies.

CHAPTER 2. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
 
 
This chapter is divided into four sections which cover the operation of NGCC power plants, 
off-design performance, waste heat recovery options for gas turbine inlet chilling and, finally, the 
need for further research. The first section explores the literature related to NGCC power plants 
including construction, performance, definitions, and principles of operation. This section also 
describes the available literature used to predict off-design performance of the NGCC power 
plants. The second section presents the waste heat recovery technologies in several areas: 
definition and principles of waste heat, potential waste heat sources, benefits of waste heat 
recovery systems, and opportunities for research. The third section presents the gas turbine inlet 
chilling options that are practiced currently. The last section discusses the gaps in the literature 
that are present in waste heat recovery and inlet air chilling for NGCC power plants, and presents 
the research needs and the motivations for the present study. 
2.1 Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plants   
NGCC power plants are an electricity producing technology that consume natural gas as a 
fuel. In this cycle, natural gas is burned in a typical gas turbine unit and the hot exhaust gas is 
routed through one or more Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSG) to produce high pressure 
steam that passes through a turbine to generate additional work. A combined cycle system can be 
divided into: a topping Brayton cycle and a bottoming Rankine cycle. The gas turbine unit forms 
the integral part of the topping Brayton cycle. A boiler/HRSG, steam turbines, condenser and feed 
water pumps form the bottoming Rankine cycle. Figure 2-1 shows the basic layout of an NGCC 
power plant. The cycle begins with ambient air being drawn into the compressor at the left of the 
8 
 
figure. The air is compressed to a desired pressure ratio, and then heated to a high temperature 
(~1300°C - 1500°C) by combusting natural gas. The hot gases are then expanded through a turbine 
which generates power. Once the heated exhaust leaves the power generation turbine, it is sent to 
the HRSG that has multiple heat exchangers to generate superheated steam, usually at multiple 
pressures. This steam is then sent to steam turbines to generate power, and, after exiting, is 
subsequently condensed and pumped before it returns to the HRSG. Depending on the steam 
saturation pressure, the HRSG could be a single or multiple pressure type. Modern CCGT power 
plants have multi-pressure HRSGs which can extract energy from high, medium, and low steam 
turbines. In this configuration, the exiting steam from the high pressure turbine feeds the medium 
pressure turbine, which subsequently feeds the low pressure turbine. By utilizing the exiting steam 
from each turbine, it is possible to generate more power and yield higher thermal efficiencies[12].   
Though NGCC power plants came into existence as early as the 1950s, it was not until the 
1990s that they gained popularity after the advent of highly efficient gas turbines and HRSGs [13].

Since the start of the 1990s, major companies like General Electric, Siemens, and Alstom have 
constructed multiple combined cycle operating gas turbine units across the globe. In the U.S. alone, 
the total number of NGCC power generators built from 2005 to 2015 reached 426 with a total 
nameplate generation capacity of 73.03 GWe [14]. Similarly, the average capacity factor of NGCC 
power plants exceeded that of the coal power plants for the first time in 2015 with NGCC power 
plants having an average running capacity factor of 56.3%, which is larger than 54.6% for coal 
fired power plants [7]. The two main reasons that NGCC power plants are gaining more popularity 
is that natural gas burns cleaner than coal and NGCC power plants have higher thermal efficiency 
compared to coal power plants. For example, Department of Energy (DOE) analyses indicate that 
every 10,000 U.S. homes powered with natural gas produced electricity instead of coal produced 
electricity avoids the annual emissions of 1,900 tons of NOx, 3,900 tons of SO2, and 5,200 tons 
of particulates [15]. Based on the life cycle assessment performed by National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory (NREL), the amount of CO2 produced per kWh of electricity produced for coal and 
natural gas power plant was 1022 and 499.1 gm-equivalent CO2 per kWh, respectively [16, 17]. 
Also, the exhaust from the natural gas turbine can be utilized in a combined cycle that can 
dramatically increase the thermal efficiency. Compared to the thermal efficiency of coal fired 
generation systems (~30% - 35%), the combined cycle efficiency can reach higher than 60% due 
to the utilization of hot exhaust gases from the gas turbine in the bottoming Rankine cycle. In 2017, 
GE built a CCGT generator unit that achieved a thermal efficiency of 62.22% [18]. Another 
important reason for NGCC power plants being a more common choice of power producers is the 
environmental regulations imposed for coal power plants. In the long term, coal-fired generation 
is anticipated to decline because of environmental regulations such as the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) implementation of Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) 
10 
 
which is resulting in some coal plant retirements [7]. The EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan (CPP), 
which included an implementation schedule starting in 2020, could result in an even more 
significant decrease in coal-fired generation [7].  
The following subsections describe the features and processes related to a typical NGCC 
power plant. The first subsection discusses the construction and operation of Heat Recovery Steam 
Generator (HRSG) of an NGCC power plant, which is followed by a subsection that describes the 
types of cooling systems utilized in the NGCC power plant. Finally, the last subsection discusses 
the off-design performance of the NGCC plant.   
2.1.1 Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) 
The HRSG is a system in which the hot gas turbine exhaust flows over a series of heat 
exchangers to produce steam. The heat exchanger usually consists of finned tubes with outer 
diameters averaging 12.7 mm to 120.65 mm [19]. As the hot exhaust gases flow past the heat 
exchanger tubes in which hot water circulates, heat is absorbed, creating steam in the tubes. The

11 
 
heat exchangers are arranged in sections, or modules, each serving a different function in the 
production of dry superheated steam. Figure 2-2 shows a typical HRSG with different types of 
heat exchanger modules. A more descriptive layout of the NGCC plant with a HRSG is shown in 
Figure 2-3. These modules are referred to as economizers, evaporators, superheaters, reheaters, 
and preheaters [12]. An economizer is a heat exchanger that preheats the water to nearly the 
saturation temperature (boiling point). The heated water from the economizer is sent to an 
evaporator. An evaporator is a heat exchanger where the hot water is boiled and steam is produced. 
The exhaust gas, after losing a significant amount of heat in the evaporator, leaves the evaporator 
at a temperature slightly higher than the saturation temperature. The difference between the 
exhaust gas temperature outlet and the evaporator saturation temperature is called the pinch point 
temperature difference. The difference between the saturation temperature and water inlet

heat exchangers.

temperature to the evaporator is called the approach temperature. Both of these are crucial design 
parameters for the heat exchangers in the HRSG. Typical average values for the pinch and 
approach temperature in the design of the HRSG are in the range of 5°C to 15°C and 5°C to 12°C, 
respectively [12]. Having too low of an approach temperature results in the formation of steam in 
the economizer. Formation of steam in the economizer should be avoided, because it may result in 
operational problems such as vibration, water hammer, and possible deposition of salts in the 
economizer tubes, which result in reduced performance. Also, heat exchanger designs with lower 
pinch temperatures have higher capital costs, but have better performance due to their higher 
effectiveness [12].  
Evaporators are typically designed with a steam drum located on the top of the finned 
evaporator tubes to collect the steam. Figure 2-4 shows a typical HRSG evaporator. The steam-
water mixture in the tubes enters the steam drum where steam is separated from the hot water using 
moisture separators and screens. The separated water is recirculated back to the evaporator tubes. 
Saturated steam from the steam drums is sent to the superheater to produce dry steam, which is 
required for the steam turbine. The degree of superheat depends on the temperature of the exhaust

gas and the effectiveness of the superheater. Usually the superheat temperatures for modern HRSG 
with saturation pressure of 16 MPa are in the range of 500°C, while for some systems the 
temperature can be higher than 600°C [20]. Higher temperatures are rare due to steam turbines and 
boiler material failure issues, which includes failures in the welding joints and seals and cyclic 
strength deformation [21]. Higher temperatures can be obtained by the use of nickel based alloys 
and new ferritic materials [22]. Reheaters are a different kind of superheater that improves the 
efficiency, and these are standard with large and modern HRSGs (Figure 2-3). The reheater is 
usually placed near the high pressure superheater in the HRSG and functions to increase the 
temperature of the returning steam from the first stage of the high-pressure turbine. It does not 
increase pressure, but the temperature gain improves the efficiency. Usually the superheat 
temperatures for the reheaters are kept the same as the other superheaters in the HRSG, which is 
usually in the range of 500°C to 600°C. Like superheaters, reheaters may be placed at various 
locations within the gas path. Preheaters are located at the coldest end of the HRSG flue gas path, 
and they absorb energy to preheat water, thus extracting the low temperature waste heat from the 
exhaust gases. The superheated steam produced by the HRSG is supplied to the steam turbine 
where it expands through the turbine blades, rotating the turbine shaft. The energy delivered to the 
generator drive shaft is converted into electricity. After exiting the steam turbine, the steam is sent 
to a condenser which routes the condensed water back to the HRSG. 
2.1.2 Cooling System 
Steam exiting from the low-pressure steam turbine must be re-pressurized to higher 
pressures, reheated to a higher temperature, and sent back to the turbines to keep the cycle running. 
The re-pressurization of the steam is typically done by condensing the steam and pumping it to a 
higher pressure. Compressing the steam by using a compressor is very energy consuming operation 
14 
 
and not a feasible solution. Instead, the steam is condensed either in a surface condenser or an air-
cooled condenser and then pumped to a higher pressure. The cooling systems can be broadly 
divided into three categories: a once-through system, a wet (i.e. evaporative) cooled system, and a 
dry (i.e. air-cooled) system. In a once-through system, the heated water is sent back to a water 
source and fresh cold water is withdrawn to keep the condensing process running. However, at 
places where once-through cooling system are not feasible, wet/evaporatively cooled towers are 
utilized to achieve the range of cooling. Cases where once through cooling are not feasible includes 
places where large water sources are not readily available, the costs of extracting water are 
exorbitantly high, or water withdrawal is prohibited by environmental regulations. The 
evaporatively cooled system (Figure 2-5a) makes use of a surface condenser heat exchanger where 
the cooling water gets heated by absorbing the heat from the condensing steam. The temperature 
difference between the cooling water temperature exiting the condenser and the saturation 
temperature of the steam is termed as Terminal Temperature Difference (TTD). The exiting 
cooling water at a higher temperature is passed through an evaporative cooling tower. Cooler 
ambient air gets mixed with the down-coming warm water and by the process of heat and mass 
                             
                            (a)                                                                                                     (b)

transfer, and the temperature of the water reduces. The colder water is then returned to the surface 
condenser and to repeat the cycle [11].  
On a dry/air-cooled condenser (Figure 2-5b), steam coming out from the steam turbine is 
passed through a steam header. The header gets divided into multiple rows of finned tubes to form 
an A-frame. A fan is utilized to force ambient air through the finned tubes. The steam gets 
condensed while passing down the inclined finned tubes, and the condensate gets collected in the 
bottom header, which is then pumped back to the HRSG [20]. A wet cooled system has a better 
performance output compared to a dry cooled system at higher ambient temperatures; however, a 
wet cooled system needs a continuous supply of make-up water to replenish the evaporated water. 
A dry cooled system is nearly 2.5 to 5 times more expensive compared to a wet cooled system 
[23]. Wet cooled systems are expected to remain the economical choice where an adequate supply 
of make-up water is available at a reasonable cost.  However, decreasing water availability, 
increasing water costs, and more stringent environmental and accessibility regulations could make 
a dry cooled system  a practical and economical choice for more power plants [24].  
2.1.3 Off-Design Performance 
The off-design performance of the NGCC power plant under consideration in this study is 
limited to the performance at different ambient conditions. Most of the off-design performance 
studies found in the literature are based on the effects of ambient temperature on the performance 
of either the gas turbine cycle or the combined cycle plant as a whole. In one empirical study of 
gas turbines, for every 1K rise in ambient temperature above ISO conditions, the gas turbine loses 
0.1% in terms of thermal efficiency and 1.47 MW of its gross (useful) power output [25]. This 
study was conducted for specific turbines Siemens SGT 94.2 (160 MW) and Siemens SGT 94.3 
(260 MW) installed at the DEWA Power Station located at Al Aweer in Dubai, UAE [25]. In 
16 
 
another similar study [26], the thermal efficiency and power output of the gas turbine was found 
to decrease linearly with increase of the ambient temperature and air to fuel ratio. However, the 
specific fuel consumption and heat rate increased linearly with increase of both ambient 
temperature and air to fuel ratio. Similarly, for smaller gas turbines, in an off-design performance 
analysis study of a Solar Centaur-40 gas turbine engine (3.5 MW), it was found that as the ambient 
temperature increases by 10°C (typically from 288 K to 298 K), output power decreased by 11.6%, 
fuel flow rate decreased by 7.45%, thermal efficiency decreased by 4%, engine pressure ratio 
decreased by 4.2%, and air flow rate decreased by 4.13% [27].  
All of these results discussed above were based on empirical studies, and the results are 
not consistent for every gas turbine system because they vary in configuration, capacity and 
manufacturer. As such, there are very few analytical approaches in the literature that can be used 
to determine the off-design performance of a gas turbine. The power output and efficiency of a gas 
turbine is highly dependent on compressor pressure ratio, and these parameters are often predicted 
by using detailed computer generated performance maps that are proprietary [28]. Hence, one 
focus of this study is to predict the performance of gas turbines by using a standard set of equations 
that can be applied to any gas turbine system. Although the compressor and turbine performance 
maps can be predicted with reasonable accuracy using geometric properties of the components 
(e.g. intake, impeller, diffuser, and casing [29]), to account for these shortcomings without these 
parameters, a concise formula is needed that could essentially capture the physics inside the gas 
turbine while also reducing tedious iterative calculations otherwise needed to predict the 
performance.  
There have also been multiple off-design performance studies for combined cycle plants 
and the results can be found in the literature. In one such empirical study [30], a combined cycle 
17 
 
unit with two Siemens AG 501F gas turbines (174.6 MW each), coupled to a three pressure level 
HRSG and re-heat cycle with supplementary firing and steam turbines (253.6 MW), was 
investigated. A thermodynamic modeling software, Gate Cycle [31], was used to predict the off-
design results. The results of the analysis show that there is nearly 19.7% power reduction in the 
gas turbine unit and nearly 17% power reduction in the combined cycle output when the ambient 
temperature changes from 0°C to 35°C. By utilizing a supplementary firing technique, where extra 
fuel is combusted after the exit of the gas turbine to increase exhaust flow and temperature, an 
increase in the exhaust gas temperature from 525°C to 675°C was seen. As a result, there was a 
gain in nearly 77 MW of power in the steam cycle, which is slightly greater than the power lost 
(75 MW) in the gas turbine unit due to ambient temperature drop. However, on average, the 
supplementary firing was estimated to create a drop in thermal efficiency by nearly 1.5% due to 
burning extra fuel. In another similar study [32], where modeling equations were used to predict 
the performance of a combined cycle with a single pressure HRSG system, there was a loss of 
about 0.04% on the combined cycle efficiency for every 1°C rise in ambient temperature. In one 
example, the gas turbine cycle efficiency decreased in the range of 0.03% to 0.07% for an ambient 
temperature increase of 1°C. The turbine inlet temperature was also varied in this study. At low 
turbine inlet temperature, the efficiency decreased more rapidly. Specifically, a decrease in 
efficiency of 0.07% at a lower turbine inlet temperature (900°C) and 0.03% at higher turbine inlet 
temperature (1400°C) for every 1°C rise in ambient temperature was reported. Fellah [33] 
conducted a study on the effects of ambient temperature on combined cycle power plant 
performance by using a modeling software HYSYS [34]. Two gas turbine units were considered 
with total power output of 169.8 MW at 15°C ambient and coupled with a dual pressure steam 
cycle. It was recorded that the output of the combined cycle decreased from 260.58 MW to 208.62 
18 
 
MW when the ambient temperature increased from 15°C to 40°C, which is a reduction in output 
by nearly 20%. The output reduction in the gas turbine alone was 23.7%.  
In the studies discussed so far, commercial software packages were used to predict the off-
design performance for the combined cycle plant and very few were done using modeling 
equations. Of those studies which presented an analytical model, the equations used only involved 
heat and mass balance approaches and entirely neglected the more complex heat transfer processes. 
These processes have critical impacts on performance when the operating parameters like 
temperature, pressure, and phase (water/steam) were changed in the heat exchangers. In particular, 
when estimating the off-design operation of the HRSG, an estimation of the heat transfer 
coefficient for each heating surface under different operating conditions is important. As discussed 
in the previous section, the HRSG is a complex set of heat exchangers including superheaters, 
evaporators, and economizers where the regime of water/steam and the flue gas temperatures are 
different for each heat exchanger. Ganapathy [12] presented a modeling approach to predict the 
heat transfer coefficients by using heat transfer equations for a single pressure HRSG system. 
Ganapathy considers exhaust parameters such as the temperature, exhaust flow rate, gas 
composition as well as several physical properties including the thermal conductivity of tube walls, 
viscosity of the steam, etc. to estimate the overall heat transfer coefficients (U) of different heating 
surfaces. Ganapathy’s research is based on a single pressure system and the geometric parameters 
of the heat exchangers has to be known for his approach.  
There are multiple other approaches in the literature that use analytical methods to predict 
the performance of the HRSG heat exchangers. Haglind [35] performed a variable geometry 
analysis for the gas turbine operating in a combined cycle power plant used for ship propulsion. In 
his study, he presented the mathematical relationship between the overall heat transfer coefficient 
19 
 
and the heat transfer coefficient of the flue gas side for each heating surface of the HRSG. The 
equations used in the present study are quite similar to Haglind’s approach except that a staggered 
tube arrangement in the HRSG heat exchangers is considered in his study whereas aligned tube 
arrangements is used in present study. Similarly, in another study [36], to predict the heat transfer 
coefficient across the heat exchanger tubes in the off-design operation, the overall heat transfer 
coefficient in the heat exchangers were varied. With the inclusion of the effects of gas-side and 
water-side convection, tube material conduction, gas side radiation, as well as surface fouling and 
fin effects (extended surface), the overall heat transfer coefficient was calculated. This calculation 
method requires numerous geometric parameters and significant computational resources due to 
the different modes of heat transfer. This approach cannot be used for calculations with minimal 
information on the heat exchanger’s geometry and materials.  Hence, by considering all the 
limitations and discussions in the literature, a simple scaling method for the heat transfer 
coefficient of the HRSG heat exchangers should be created to predict the performance at off-design 
operating conditions. More details of the modeling approach are presented in the following 
chapter. In the following section, the current state-of-the-art waste heat recovery systems, 
including ongoing research, are presented.   
2.2 Waste Heat Recovery 
 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory showed that, in 2016,  66.4% of total useful 
energy is rejected as waste energy [37]. 28.5% of the total energy generation is extracted from 
natural gas, and 10.3% of the natural gas is used in electricity generation.  Enerdata [3] showed 
that for the base year 2011 that the average efficiency of gas combined cycle power plants in North 
America (U.S., Canada and Mexico) is nearly 42% with a total penetration of nearly 27%. Figure 
2-6 shows the state of combined cycle plants across the globe and the average thermal efficiencies 
20 
 
of these plants.  Compared to the rest of the world, the combined cycle technology is quite mature 
and efficient in North America; yet, nearly 60% of the total energy is still rejected as waste energy 
from these power plants. Besides energy losses in power generation, a significant proportion of 
waste energy rejection also occurs in heavy-duty industrial factories including chemical industries, 
cement manufacturing, petroleum refineries and mining factories. These heat losses occur in the 
main processes of the plants that usually involve high temperatures. During these manufacturing 
processes, as much as 20 to 50% of the energy consumed is ultimately lost via waste heat contained 
in streams of hot exhaust gases and liquids, as well as through heat conduction, convection, and 
radiation from hot equipment surfaces and from heated product streams [1]. Waste heat recovery 
provides an opportunity to increase efficiency, save operational costs, and reduce emissions in 
these industries.  
For waste heat recovery to be a feasible solution, three essential components are required: 
(1) an accessible source of waste heat, (2) a recovery technology, and (3) a use for the recovered 
energy [1]. The sources of waste heat include combustion exhaust gases, process exhaust, hot gases

from drying ovens, and cooling tower water. Usually, there are three important parameters used in 
the description of the waste heat: quantity, quality, and availability [38]. These parameters are

In equation (2.1), Q refers to the energy in the waste stream, which is the quantity of heat from the 
waste stream, T0 represents the ambient temperature , T represents the waste heat temperature, 
which can be regarded as the quality of the waste heat, and ϕ represents the availability, which is 
also known as the maximum amount of waste heat that can be utilized efficiently from a source to 
produce work. 
 Depending on temperature, a waste heat source can be categorized into three categories: 
high grade waste heat which exceeds temperatures of 1,200ºF (649ºC), medium grade which is 
between 1,200ºF (649ºC) and 450ºF (232ºC), and low grade which has a temperature less than 
450ºF (232ºC) [1]. Table 2-1 shows a summary of these three different categories of waste heat 
sources in industry, their advantages and disadvantages, and the typical recovery methods used to 
extract the waste heat. 
The recovered waste heat can be utilized in three major categorical ways as noted in Table 
2-1: heating and cooling, heat engine operation for electricity generation, or as a heat pump for air 
conditioning/refrigeration purposes. For the heating application, a high to medium temperature 
waste heat source can be used in a recuperator or a regenerator to exchange heat between working 
fluids, or in a passive air heater to heat the incoming air or in the waste heat boilers and 
economizers. Waste heat applications for heat pumps can serve primarily two functions: either the 
waste heat can be utilized to lift the temperature of another stream, or it can be used as an input to 
drive an absorption cooling system which is discussed in detail in the following sections. Another 
potential option is to use the waste heat to drive a heat engine cycle.  Table 2-2 presents the 
23 
 
different heat engine cycles and thermal to electrical conversion technologies that can be operated 
through waste heat utilization. The most popular heat to electricity conversion cycles are the first 
three presented in Table 2-2. Extensive researches have been done on Organic Rankine Cycle 
(ORC) and traditional steam cycles to convert waste heat into energy. However, the present study 
is focused on utilizing waste heat for cooling the inlet air of the gas turbine by using a thermally 
activated cooling system.  In the following section, the practices for gas turbine inlet chilling are 
discussed.   
2.3 Gas Turbine Inlet Air Cooling 
The power output and efficiency of an NGCC power plant is highly influenced by the gas 
turbine inlet air temperature. As discussed in previous sections, the performance of the power plant 
degrades with increasing ambient temperature. One simple strategy to improve the performance 
of the power plant under high ambient temperature is to employ gas turbine inlet air cooling 
technologies (GTIAC). GTIAC technologies are extensively used in hot climatic conditions where 
the average temperature remains high compared to ISO operating conditions throughout the year

[39-41]. Multiple analytical and experimental studies have been carried out to outline the effects 
of GTIAC technologies in both simple and combined cycle operating power plants. There are 
several GTIAC technologies which are in practice, including high pressure fogging, wetted media 
evaporative cooling, absorption cooling, thermal energy storage and using electrically driven vapor 
compression chiller.   
High-pressure fogging is the process of spraying of droplets of demineralized water, 5 to 
20 microns in diameter, into air inlet ducts at 1000 to 3000 psi. As the fog droplets evaporate, 
100% relative humidity is produced and the air is cooled to the wet-bulb temperature: the lowest 
possible temperature obtainable without refrigeration [42]. Wetted media evaporative cooling, 
however, uses the latent heat of vaporization to cool the ambient air temperature from the dry bulb 
to the wet-bulb temperature. Water in the wetted media vaporizes by taking in heat from ambient 
air, thus cooling the inlet air to the gas turbine. Both of these cooling techniques are susceptible to 
lower performance at high ambient relative humidity and cannot cool the incoming air below the 
wet-bulb temperature [42]. Absorption inlet air cooling is a technique where heat from potential 
heat sources is recovered in the absorption chiller by use of a binary fluid (e.g., LiBr-H2O, H2O-
NH3).  
A typical vapor absorption cycle produces a cooling effect in the form of chilled water 
which is passed through a heat exchanger to cool the ambient air temperature [42]. Similarly, an 
electrically driven vapor compression chiller can be used in a similar fashion as absorption chiller 
except the cooling is powered by an electrical compressor compared to heat driven absorption 
systems. Both absorption and compression systems usually utilize chilled water to cool the turbine 
inlet air where the temperature can be cooled to a lower temperature irrespective of the wet-bulb 
temperature. Hence these systems are preferred to fogging or the evaporative cooling when at 
25 
 
places where the relative humidity is high. In the following paragraphs, typical studies conducted 
by utilizing these cooling systems are presented.  
Nasser et. al. [43] noted that by running a single effect LiBr-H2O absorption chiller and by 
extracting the gas turbine waste heat, it was possible to enhance the power output by nearly 20% 
in summer without additional fuel requirements. Al-Bortmany [44] discussed the use of aqua-
ammonia absorption chillers powered by heat extracted from gas-turbine exhaust gases. The inlet 
air of two gas turbines in Oman was cooled to 7°C resulting in power gains of 20% and 14%. 
Ameri et. al. [45] showed that by installing two steam driven LiBr-H2O absorption chillers in a 
16.6 MW gas turbine unit, a power output enhancement of nearly 11.3% could be achieved. The 
pay-back period for this retrofit was estimated as 4.2 years. Mohanty et. al. [46] analytically 
studied a gas turbine power plant (100 MW) in Thailand and demonstrated that electricity 
generation could increase by nearly 11% by using a double effect absorption chiller. Additionally, 
they demonstrated that installing a new gas turbine unit to create the same amount of power would 
cost nearly four times the waste heat driven absorption chiller.  
In the previous studies, absorption chillers were used and the major source of energy was 
the high temperature gas turbine exhaust or process steam. Techniques like evaporative cooling, 
fogging, and electrical chilling, are also used to chill the gas turbine inlet air and multiple studies 
have been done. Dawoud et. al [47] compared different gas turbine inlet air cooling techniques for 
a preinstalled gas turbine (39.62 MW)
