Usingdata from 264 prefecture-level cities and above in China after theglobal financial crisis, we examine producer services’ impact interms of diversification (PSD) and specialization (PSS) on urbanER, and also the mediating effect of industrial structure upgrading(ISU). The results show that Cities with more diversified producerservices are more resilient to crises, while the effect direction ofPSS is the opposite. ISU is partly how PSD and PSS affect ER.Finally, producer services agglomeration’s impact on ER has sig-nificant regional heterogeneity. PSD is very conducive to urbanER in the economically developed eastern region and the lessdeveloped western region. The more specialized the developmentof producer services in eastern and north-eastern regions, theless conducive it is to enhancing ER. Our findings can helpstabilize China’s economy and achieve high-quality economicdevelopment.ARTICLE HISTORYReceived 21 July 2022Accepted 20 November 2022KEYWORDSProducer services; economicresilience; diversification;specialization; industrialstructure upgradingSUBJECTCLASSIFICATION CODESO11; O14; R1101. IntroductionUncertainties have increased worldwide, not only in relation to the global financialcrisis of 2008, but also to numerous risk factors including global economic slowdown,Sino-US trade friction and the COVID-19 pandemic. Uncertainties triggered manyproblems, including production cuts, layoffs by enterprises, sluggish domestic con-sumption, and insufficient investment. Some cities exhibited strong sensitivity andvolatility, while others have maintained stability and recovered quickly post-crisis(Ron Martin, 2011). As a core concept to measure differentiated performance, eco-nomic resilience (ER) has become a research hotspot in evolutionary economic geog-raphy and an important perspective on how China can cope with complexenvironment (Cainelli et al., 2019; Cheng & Zhang, 2020; Hu et al., 2022).

Martin et al., 2016; J. Tan et al.,2020). Some scholars found that industries with more development prospects, such asservice industry, are more resistant and capable of transformation to shocks. Citieswith predominantly manufacturing, due to the existence of higher sunk costs and exitbarriers, are easy to form road dependence and poor ER performance.Indeed, even in regions where manufacturing is the dominant industry, improvingsupply and industrial chains may reduce the interference of external environmentchanges on economic operation (Mai et al., 2019). Producer services, consisting offinancial services, information services, R&D services, technological services, etc.,have gradually separated from the manufacturing, and have become an importantcomponent of industrial chain of manufacturing. The spatial agglomeration of produ-cer services not only enables related enterprises to achieve scale economies of inter-mediate inputs and share similar labor, but also tends to create positive knowledgespillovers. It plays a significant role in promoting the manufacturing industry upgrad-ing and the economic resilience improvement through specialized division of labor,reducing transaction costs and promoting regional innovation. Moreover, the collab-orative agglomeration of producer services and manufacturing can also promote thefull participation of producer services in all production links of manufacturing, andaccelerate the transformation from primary manufacturing to knowledge-intensiveand technology-intensive high-end manufacturing. The collaborative agglomerationcan also accelerate the decomposition, extension and reorganization of value chain,and give more core technologies and services to the new value chain, which is condu-cive to value chain upgrading and economic resilience enhancing (Mai et al., 2021).Therefore, producer services agglomeration not only helps manufacturing to breakaway from path dependence and structure upgrading, but also plays an importantrole in effectively withstanding shocks.However, there is a lack of research on the mechanism between producer servicesagglomeration and economic resilience. Related studies mainly focused on the correl-ation between producer services agglomeration and manufacturing development,regional innovation level or efficiency and green economic growth (Peng et al., 2022;Ren et al., 2019; Z. Yu et al., 2022). Although the literature has demonstrated the roleof producer services agglomeration in the transformation of urban economic develop-ment patterns and the acceleration of regional industrial innovation and restructur-ing, it has not been included in the crisis shock framework. Moreover, producerservices agglomeration constitutes a breakthrough in promoting industrial structureupgrading (ISU). ISU is crucial for smooth economic transformation and rapid recov-ery after external shocks. However, the literature has ignored the mediating role ofISU. Hence, we scientifically measure the level of producer services diversification(PSD), specialization (PSS), and ER after the 2008 global financial crisis. Using apanel regression model, we explore whether and to what extent producer servicesagglomeration explains ER in 264 Chinese cities. Additionally, we also test whetherISU is a mediating variable for the impact of producer services agglomeration on ER.We further examine heterogeneous influences by dividing the cities into four regions.2 Y. DU ET AL.These results provide a basis for regional policymaking and a reference for otheremerging economies to enhance urban resilience.This study contributes to the literature as follows. First, we propose a novel per-spective of connecting producer services agglomeration with ER. Our analysis extendsrelevant literature with an exploration of whether and to what extent PSD and PSSimpact ER. We also explore the intermediary role of ISU. Second, by evaluating ERof 264 cities in China, we not only emphasize the universal role of producer servicesagglomeration in ER, but also highlight regional differences. Third, by using Chinesecities as the research area, this paper can provide an empirical basis for improvingeconomic resilience in China, and also has reference value for many developing coun-tries. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a briefliterature review. Section 3 elaborates on the theoretical framework. Section 4 intro-duces data sources, variables measures, and regression models. We provide our resultsand discussion in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the main findings, and providesimplications and limitations of our conclusions.2. Literature review2.1. Origin and concept of economic resilienceThe phrase ER originates from ecology. It refers to the ability of a system to maintainits stability and recover from external shocks (Holling, 1973). Recent years, especiallyafter the 2008 global financial crisis, ER has become a research hotspot in regionaleconomics and economic geography (Ron Martin, 2011), which is primarily used tounderstand the differences in the ability of different regions to withstand and recoverfrom various shocks or disturbances. The concept of ER has gradually transformedfrom engineering and ecological resilience, based on equilibrium theory, to adaptiveresilience based on evolutionary theory. Adaptive resilience emphasizes unbalanceddevelopment of economic trajectories and openness to adaptation, which is widelyrecognized (Balland et al., 2015). Martin and Sunley (2015) further standardized andperfected the concept, and defined it as a path-dependent process of continuousadjustment and adaptation, including resistance, recovery, re-orientation andpath renewal.2.2. Measurement and determinants of economic resilienceRelated studies on ER have mainly focused on measurement methods and determi-nants. Currently, it is generally accepted to use different resilience indicators to assesscities’ ER, such as employment, gross domestic product (GDP), export value, andindustrial added value (Doran & Fingleton, 2016; Ron Martin, 2011; Ubago Martınezet al., 2019). Many scholars revealed differences in resilience of some countries orregions after the 2008 financial crisis or COVID-19, and empirically found the deter-minants of ER, such as industrial structure, network relations, technology networkstructure, and government regulatory behavior (Cainelli et al., 2019; Faggian et al.,2018; Toth et al., 2022). It is widely believed that industrial structure is an importantinfluencing factor, which is manifested in industry’s agglomeration forms andECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 3dominant industry types. Diversified agglomerations are better at spreading risk andreflecting resilience than single-industry agglomerations (R. Martin et al., 2016).Moreover, areas dominated by heavy industry generally have a higher degree ofindustrial structure specialization. Due to high silent costs and exit barriers, theregional ability to resist risks is weak (Mai et al., 2021). Service industries, especiallyproducer services, interact closely with manufacturing and facilitate knowledge spill-overs and innovation formation, thus helping cities to adapt to industrial structureupgrading and ER enhancing (Cuadrado-Roura & Maroto, 2016).2.3. Producer services agglomeration and economic resilienceThe relationship between producer services agglomeration and ER has been lessstudied by scholars. However, studies on the effects of producer services agglomer-ation on manufacturing development, regional innovation level and green develop-ment, provide theoretical references for mechanism exploration in this paper. Z. Yuet al. (2022) adopted data from 18 industries in 44 countries, and empirical resultsshowed that imported inputs of producer services had a positive impact on domesticmanufacturing exports. Based on data of three major urban agglomerations in China,Peng et al. (2022) empirically found that urban agglomeration was not the way toimprove innovation efficiency, and the collaborative agglomeration of high-tech man-ufacturing and producer services had an inverted U-shaped relationship with innov-ation efficiency. Ren et al. (2019) found that PSS and PSD negatively and positivelycontribute to green economic efficiency, respectively. PSS even has a negative spatialspillover effect on neighbouring regions.The literature examining the impact of producer services agglomeration on eco-nomic growth and industrial structure is most relevant to our paper. However, thereis little relevant literature. Lundquist et al. (2008) used 30 years of developmentexperience in Sweden to verify the great role of the renewal and transformation ofproducer services in driving economic growth. Wen (2020) showed that the special-ization agglomeration of producer services can positively contribute to the industrialstructure upgrading in China through accelerating innovation and allocating marketefficiency. Christopher et al. (2016) found that different sectors of producer serviceshave different effects on economic growth after studying the Washington D.C. metro-politan area. Specialized design and management consulting have the function ofpromoting economic development, while computer services restrict economicdevelopment.2.4. Research gapIn summary, the above literature has deepened the research on relationship betweenproducer services agglomeration and industrial structure or economic growth, andhas yielded many enlightening findings. However, following questions are still worthexploring. First, related researches have not been placed in the context of a crisis.Whether and how producer services agglomeration can help regional economies toagainst risk, needs to be further explored. Second, studies on ER have mainly focused4 Y. DU ET AL.on cities that were developed countries, emerging economies, large cities, etc.Relatively few studies have been conducted at the city level in China, which is thelargest developing country. Third, there is little research in the existing literature ondifferences in the performance and influencing factors of ER in Chinese differentregions post-crisis. Large differences exist between the northeastern, eastern, centraland western regions of China in terms of economic development level, leading indus-tries types and resource endowments. Therefore, it is necessary to explore theregional heterogeneity in the relationship between producer services agglomerationand ER.3. Theoretical frameworkBased on the research of Martin (2011) and Aghion et al. (2015), we combine produ-cer services agglomeration with ISU, not only emphasizing agglomeration’s key rolein enhancing ER, but also explaining structural changes and sector upgrading in thepost-crisis economic growth process. The specific intrinsic mechanisms areshown below.3.1. Direct impact of producer services agglomeration on economic resilienceThe effects of agglomeration economy can be divided into specialization and diversifi-cation effects. Hence, producer services agglomeration can be divided correspondinglyinto specialization and diversification (Neffke et al., 2011). PSD reflects the agglomer-ation of different types of producer services in the same city, it can affect ER in threeways (see Figure 1): First, diversified producer services can play the role of risk buf-fers. The existing literature shows that manufacturing is prone to path locking andthus less ER. Close interaction between producer services and manufacturing enablesa diversified producer services to absorb manufacturing’s economic fluctuation.Second, diversified producer services can help the manufacturing to reduce produc-tion costs and increase productivity, thus contributing to economic recovery andtransformation after a crisis (H. Chen, 2019). Third, the more diversified producerservices are, the easier they are to achieve the creation, dissemination, and internaland external diffusion of knowledge. It can attract the inflow of high-level humanFigure 1. Direct influence mechanism of producer services agglomeration to economic resilience.Source: Authors’ own calculation.ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 5resources, promote a new economic equilibrium by creating new sectors, and ultim-ately enhance urban ER.PSS reflects agglomeration state of the same type of producer services in a certaincity (Hong et al., 2020). First, PSS can generate scale economy effects, thus reducingtrade costs between different industries, improving technological level and productionefficiency (M. Chen, 2017). Second, PSS can also generate knowledge spillover effects.Specialization agglomeration allows employees with similar production service tech-nologies to engage in formal or informal learning and exchange within the industryand between producer services and manufacturing. This can facilitate the emergenceof new technologies, products and pathways, and improve the urban transformationcapacity (H. Chen, 2019). However, PSS may also be detrimental to economic resili-ence. First, specialization agglomeration forms a close connection among producerservice enterprises. Employees who master similar or related technologies are highlyconcentrated, so it cannot act as a buffer in an economic crisis. This not only leadsto unemployed workers, but also decreases the likelihood of new growth paths(Boschma, 2015). Second, manufacturing is less selective in adjusting and optimizingthe supply of intermediate suppliers in the regions with high concentration of produ-cer services specialization. Especially, when manufacturing is closely linked to specificproducer services, there may even be difficulties in some areas where it is impossibleto restore normal production order by seeking alternative suppliers. Therefore,whether PSS has a positive or negative impact on Chinese urban ER after a crisisdeserves further discussion.3.2. Indirect impact of producer services agglomeration on urban economicresilience through industrial structure upgradingISU refers to the gradual transition from primary and secondary industries to tertiaryindustries, while improving technology as well as labor productivity. It plays animportant role in promoting high quality and sustainable development of urban econ-omy. As a tertiary industry with high knowledge content and industrial correlation,producer services agglomeration has a significant impact on ISU (see Figure 2).The role of PSD in ISU is shown below. First, PSD can be a lubricant between dif-ferent industries. PSD not only increases closeness to upstream enterprises, but alsoprovides downstream enterprises with more abundant and convenient intermediateproducts. This improves cooperation efficiency between industrial departments, opti-mizes input structure, and promotes ISU. Moreover, PSD promotes transactional ornon-transactional exchange activities between enterprises, expands the spread andscope of knowledge, and facilitates the formation of new ideas and innovative.Technological innovation is regarded as the primary driving force of ISU (Wen,2020). Finally, PSD can also increase segmented industries, expand related marketdemands, and promote ISU through scale economics. PSS also plays a positive role inISU (Zhao et al., 2021). It can not only promote knowledge spillover by giving fullplay to targeted service advantages, but also encourages other industries to regardproducer services as intermediate input products, freeing up more time and humanresources for improving labor productivity. This helps technological innovation and6 Y. DU ET AL.ISU. Moreover, PSS also enables the accumulation of specialized human resourcesand the transfer of production processes to high value-added and high-tech levels,thus achieving knowledge and technology spillovers through collective learning. Thiscan effectively promote ISU.ISU plays a role in stabilizing economic fluctuations. First, ISU brings differentindustrial combination effects. A typical sign of ISU is significant increase in theshare of services. Services can effectively absorb the economic and total factor prod-uctivity fluctuations brought by the crisis to the manufacturing, thus enhancing urbaneconomic resilience. Second, ISU has self-optimization effect. ISU enables the applica-tion of information technology, digital economy and other high technologies to moreenterprises, which can effectively increase technological innovation, total factor prod-uctivity and economic aggregate (Burren & Neusser, 2013), thus promoting economictransformation and recovery in the post-crisis era. Thirdly, ISU’s linkage effectenhances ER. Services and manufacturing have strong demand on human capital andmaterial capital respectively, and human capital is more stable than material capital.Therefore, along with the continuous increase of the share of services in the processof ISU, economy may be more resilience to volatility during external shocks.4. Data sources and methods4.1. Data sourcesBased on the availability of data during the study period, this study excludes somecities due to administrative division adjustment or serious data loss, such as Chaohu,Bijie, Tongren, Sansha, etc. Our research covers 264 of the 297 cities at the prefectureor higher level, i.e., 88.89% of total number of cities in China. The sample citiesaccount for 93.71% of the national GDP. These cities consist of four municipalitiesdirectly under the Central Government, 30 provincial capital cities, sub-provincialcapital cities, and other cities at prefecture level or above. Therefore, the selected citysamples are typical, representative and diverse. The data of research area are derivedFigure 2. Indirect influence mechanism of producer services agglomeration to economic resilience.Source: Authors’ own calculation.ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 7from the China City Statistical Yearbook and the China Statistical Yearbook from2009 to 2015, both of which are collected by the China’s National Bureau of Statistics(CNBS). However, these official data on China’s cities are not without discrepanciesand errors (Lin, 2002). Obvious outliers (outliers in the scatterplot of the data) andsome missing values are supplemented by the Quadratic Match Average Method.Despite some limitations, the data provided by CNBS is still the most systematic,comprehensive and authoritative in China, and widely used in the literature (Fanet al., 2021). According to the Statistical Classification of Producer Services (2019),producer services consist mainly of the following sub-industries: transportation, ware-housing and postal service; information transmission, computer services and softwareindustry; wholesale and retail; financial; leasing and business services; scientificresearch, technical services, and geological survey.Global financial crisis of 2008 caused GDP growth rate to drop from 14.16% in2007 to 9.21% in 2009. Chinese government’s RMB 4 trillion investment policy hadhelped GDP rebound temporarily. However, against the backdrop of a slowdown inthe world economy, Chinese government also emphasized that China had entered thenew normal stage of stable (characterized by sustainable and stable economic growth)economic growth for the first time in December 2013, which led to a new downwardtrend for China’s GDP growth rate. Therefore, the 2008 to 2014 period is defined asa recession here (J. T. Tan et al., 2020), which accurately describes China’s economicperformance after the global financial crisis, and discards the influence of other fac-tors on China’s economic fluctuations.4.2. Variable measurement4.2.1. Dependent variable: Economic resilienceThe method proposed by Martin et al. (R. Martin et al., 2016) has been widely usedto measure urban ER. The basic idea is to measure ER based on the differencebetween real and expected or counterfactual economic output or employment.Considering that employment is the most sensitive to the crisis, and its recovery ismore difficult than GDP, we measure ER based on the employee number of Chinesecities as follows:ERi ¼ ðEti  Etki Þ=Etki  ðEtr  Etkr Þ=EtkrðEtr  Et1r Þ=Et1r  (1)where Eti and Etki respectively indicate number of employees in city i at ending timet and starting time t-k. Etr and Etkr are the number of employees nationwide, asexpected or counterfactual changes. When ER is positive, it indicates that variation ofemployment in city i is greater than national level, and the ER level is significantlyhigher than national average.The descriptive statistics of ER (see Table 1) indicates that 264 cities showed weakcrisis resistance, with mainly negative ER value. 0.312 and 1.690 are mean andstandard value of ER respectively, indicating that cities’ employment growth rate con-tracted more than the nation as a whole, and there are large disparities between cities.8 Y. DU ET AL.Due to regional differences in geographical location, resource endowment, and eco-nomic growth level, ER values show significant regional heterogeneity (see Figure 3).Cities in the eastern and central regions routinely can withstand shocks higher thannational average, while northeast region’s resilience is weaker due to difficulties in thetransformation of heavy industry and path dependence. We observe two high valuesin 2011 and 2013, indicating a significant increase in the number of cities abovenational resilience level in both years. Probably because Chinese government investedRMB 4 trillion from 2008 to 2010 to stimulate domestic demand, as well as focusingon ISU and improving services competitiveness.4.2.2. Independent variables: Producer services diversification and specializationAt present, measurement of industrial agglomeration is mainly carried out on theaspects of agglomeration scale and density, and the effects of different types ofagglomeration are not considered (Xie & Li, 2021). Combes (2000) measured indus-trial agglomeration level from the aspects of diversification and specialization, whichhas important reference significance. Hence, we measure PSD and PSS by measure-ment method of Combes (2000).PSDi ¼XsEisEi1=Pns0¼1, s0 6¼s Eis0=ðEi  EisÞ½ 21=Pns0¼1, s0 6¼s Es0=ðE EsÞ½ 22435 (2)Table 1.

Ei indi-cate numbers of employees in city i. Eis is number of employees in producer servicesindustry s in city i. E is the number of employees nationwide. Es is number ofemployees in producer services industry s in China. Eis0 represents the total numberof employees other than producer services industry s in city i. Es0 is number ofemployees other than producer services in China. The larger PSD is, the higher thedegree of PSD is.PSSi ¼ Eis=EiEs=E (3)where PSSi means the PSS of city i, other variables in the formula have the samemeaning as PSD formula. The higher the index value of PSSi, indicates the city ismore specialized in services agglomeration.4.2.3. Mediating variable: Industrial structure upgradingThe literature shows that economy servitization (Also known as Tertiarization) is typ-ical fact of ISU (Wang & Wei, 2021), and the improvement of total factor productiv-ity (TFP) is its driving force. Measuring ISU level should not only consider transferfrom primary and secondary industry to tertiary industry, but also the transfer fromlow productivity to high productivity. Therefore, we follow the method proposed byYu (2019) to measure ISU.ISUi ¼ Indi  Proi (4)where Indi is output value ratio of tertiary industry to the secondary industry of cityi in t, Proi is the labor productivity ratio of the tertiary industry to the second-ary industry.4.2.4. Control variablesBased on mature literature, we select a series of control variables to mitigate the esti-mation bias caused by missing variables. We measure the degree of opening-up(Open) by the proportion of total output value of firms with foreign investment abovea certain level in the total industrial output value (R. Martin et al., 2015). Accordingto the method of Han and Yang (2020), The human resource level (HumCap) isexpressed by the per capita years of education. The calculation formula is as follows:HumCap ¼ ðColl  16þHi 12þMid  9þ Pri 6Þ=Total: Coll is the number ofpeople with college education or above, Hi is the number of people with highschool education in the same year, Mid and Pri represent the number of people withmiddle school and primary education respectively, Total is the total numbers of laborforce. Degree of market vitality (MarVi) is represented by the proportion of privateand self-employed workers in the total number of urban employed (Xu & Zhang,2019) . We refer to calculation method of financial development level (FinLe) byLi and Liu (2012). The formula is as follows: FinLe ¼ Loanscity=GDP  ð1State Assetprovince=social AssetprovinceÞ: Loanscity is total city loan of a city,State Assetprovince represents total investment in state-owned fixed assets of the10 Y. DU ET AL.province where the city is located. Social Assetprovince is gross investment in socialfixed assets of province. We use growth rate of fixed asset investment to measuregovernment management ability (GovInter) (J. Tan et al., 2020). The key variables aresummarized in Table 1.4.3. Regression modelsWe employ a panel regression model to analyze effects of PSD and PSS on ER. Tosolve missing variables problem over time and individual city, a time-city binary fixedeffects model is established in our paper. The model of panel regression is as follows(Liu et al., 2019; J. T. Tan et al., 2020).ERit ¼ b0 þ b1PSAit þ b2Controlsit þ li þ ct þ eit (5)where ERit is economic resilience in region i of t year, PSA is the core independentvariable, including PSDit and PSSit: Controlsit are control variables. eit is the errorterm. li and ct are the city and time fixed effect, respectively.To further explore whether ISU plays a mediating role between producer servicesagglomeration and ER, we use Mediation Effect model based on the research ofBaron and Kenny (1986).ISUit ¼ a0 þ a1PSAit þ a2Controlsit þ li þ ct þ eit (6)ERit ¼ u0 þ u1PSAit þ u2ISUit þ u3Controlsit þ li þ ct þ eit (7)In models (5) to (7), ISUit is industrial structure upgrading in city i of t year, b0,a0, u0 respectively represent the intercept term. Whether there is a mediating effectmust meet the following conditions. If b1 is not statistically significant, the mediatingeffect is directly rejected. If both b1, a1, and u2 are statistically significant, there is apartial mediating effect when u1 is significant and smaller than b1, and a completemediating effect when u1 is not significant. If at least one of a1 and u2 is not signifi-cant, the Sobel test is required to judge the mediation effect’s significance.5. Empirical resultsFirst, to observe the relationship more intuitively, we present the scatter plot betweenER and two core explanatory variables (see Figure 4). The lines in the figure are twofitted lines. It is clear that PSD and ER are significantly associated with urban ER inpost-crisis period. The slope of fitted lines of PSD and ER (1.388) is positive, indicat-ing that there is a significant positive correlation between them. This is consistentwith the view of Martin et al. (2016), that industrial structure diversification is condu-cive to economic resistance to crisis and recovery of transformation capacity. Theslope of fitting line of PSS and ER is 1.121, showing a significant negativecorrelation.ECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 115.1. Baseline regressionTo explore the direct and indirect effects of PSD and PSS on urban ER, we conductregression analysis on the empirical model set up in Part 4. Considering multicolli-nearity between variables, we calculated variance inflation factor (VIF). The resultsshow that the maximum VIF is 1.75, which is far less than the cut-off value 10 com-monly used. This indicates that there are no serious multicollinearity problems. Theresults of the regression models are presented in Table 2.In Table 2 (Model 1 and Model 2), both PSD and PSS have significant effects onER at the 1% level.

DU ET AL.economic shock, while cities with more specialized experience more serious economicrecession. PSS has a negative effect on ER partly for the following reasons: The devel-opment of China’s high-end manufacturing is still immature. To deal with risks, thereis an urgent need to transfer to services industry, especially production services.However, the convergence of manufacturing and producer services is inadequate,which results in the weak ER. Besides, specialization agglomeration of producer serv-ices leads to fewer opportunities for generating new industries and paths to generate,making the economic structure less flexible. From the results of control variables, wecan draw that MarVi has a significant negative impact, related to vitality lack, poorbusiness environment, and the declining private investment growth rate in mostChinese cities. As expected, cities with higher FinLe level are better to with-stand crises.According to Model 3 and 4 in Table 2, PSD has a significant positive impact andPSS has a negative impact on urban ISU. The impact of PSD was expected. However,the negative impact of PSS is partly due to the following factors: First, most Chinesecities are still located at the middle and low-end manufacturing links of the valuechain, with low and simple demand for producer services. Therefore, the specializedand high-end level of the producer services is insufficient, which is unfavorable toISU. Second, path dependence effect of PSS in Chinese cities is greater than scaleeconomy effect, which is not conducive to ISU.Table 2. (Model 5) exhibits the regression results with ISU and PSD added to themodel, which show that they both have significant effects on urban ER. The regres-sion coefficient value of PSD is smaller than that of Model 1. Similarly, Table 2(Model 6) indicates that ISU and PSS also have significant effects. Furthermore, theabsolute value of PSS regression coefficient is smaller than that of Model 2. Theseresults indicate that ISU plays a mediating effect on the impact of PSD and PSS onurban ER. Then, Sobel test is conducted in our paper. Sobel Z statistics all passed thestatistical test at 1% level, which fully confirmed the significance of the mediationeffect. Specifically,10.92% of positive impact of PSD on ER is achieved through ISU,while 5.95% of negative impact of PSS is achieved through ISU.5.2. Regional heterogeneity testChina encompasses a vast territory. Different resource distributions, economic devel-opment levels, institutional environments, and other factors lead to differences inregional producer services agglomeration’s impact on resilience during a crisis.Therefore, based on the National Bureau of Statistics’ classification standards (CSY,2018), we divide Chinese cities into four regions (i.e., northeast, eastern, central, andwestern regions). The interaction terms of producer services agglomeration anddummy variables of eastern, central, and western are added to Equation (5). Theresults are reported in Table 3.In the eastern and western regions, PSD positively affects ER (Model 1 in Table 3).The economic contribution of the tertiary industry in the eastern developed region isgreater, and the level of producer services agglomeration is higher. Moreover, manu-facturing development prefers more diversified producer services, which furtherECONOMIC RESEARCH-EKONOMSKA ISTRAŽIVANJA 13stimulates the development of innovation and PSD in the eastern region. Therefore,negative impact caused by external shocks can be quickly absorbed, and transferred.Although PSD level in the western region is low, cities there focus on developing pro-ducer services that match the industrial structure, competitive factors, and economicdevelopment level by relying on their factor endowments. Therefore, PSD can alsohelp western region withstand the crisis. PSD in the northeast and central regions hasno significant impact on urban ER. Because the economic structure of these regionsis still dominated by manufacturing, and diversified development of producer servicesgenerally lags (Wen, 2020). The level of coordination and convergence between pro-ducer services and manufacturing is low, and a good interactive relationship cannotbe formed. Hence, it restricts the promotion of ER.Based on Table 3 (Model 2), we find that PSS in the northeast and eastern regionshas negative impacts on ER. PSS in the central region positively affects ER, but notsignificantly. The manufacturing structure in central region is relatively single, so PSS,which meets the demands of dominant industrial development, more easily gives fullplay to scale economy effects and knowledge spillover effects. However, due to develop-ment level of producer services, this positive effect is not significant. The negativeimpact of PSS on ER in the western region is not significant. The main reason is thatthe producer services established under local government intervention are divorcedfrom local comparative advantages and industrial development needs. Moreover, pro-ducer services in such cities have a low level of specialization, which is not conduciveto forming a positive interaction with manufacturing in the face of crisis.5.3. Robustness testTo test for robustness, firstly, we changed the measure method of ER. Economic out-put is the overall indicator to measure a country’s economy, so the change of realGDP is substituted into Equation (1) to get ER1. Furthermore, based on the methodproposed by Ron Martin (2011), we assume that all cities expand or contract at thesame speed when they encounter a financial crisis. ER2 is calculated by the followingformula:Table 3.

DEt=Etis the change rate in total employment in the province where the city is located.Based on the results of Model 1 to 4 in Table 4, we find that PSD is good for enhanc-ing ER, while PSS is unfavorable. The conclusion does not change with differentmethods of measurement.Second, we add provincial-time joint fixed effects to Equation (5). In differentyears, provinces issued various policy documents to promote producer servicesagglomeration, which can lead to different efforts to promote it in different provinces.To control the time-varying characteristics of provinces, the combined province-timefixed effect is added in Equation (5). Regression results are shown in Model 5–6 inTable 4. The results indicate that the regression results of PSD and PSS on urban ERare consistent with the baseline regression results in Table 2.6. Conclusions and prospectsIn recent years, people have conducted extensive and in-depth research on how toimprove regional economic resilience. Our exploration has contributed to theoreticaland empirical research in this field. Our study first establishes a theoretical mechan-ism for the effects of PSD and PSS on economic resilience. Then, based on the paneldata of 264 cities in China, the direct effects of PSD and PSS on economic resilienceand the mediating effects of ISU are investigated. We also conducted heterogeneitytest and robustness test. The empirical results show that PSD has a significant positiveeffect on enhancing urban ER, while PSS has a significant negative effect.

Additionally, The effects of PSD and PSS on ER show heterogeneity indifferent regions. PSD positively affect ER in eastern and western regions, but thiseffect is not significant in northeast and central regions. PSS in northeast and easternregions have a negative influence on ER, while the influence in central and westernregion don’t pass the significance test.These conclusions don’t mean that cities should ignore PSS and actively promotePSD. Instead, the agglomeration model should be selected by comprehensively con-sidering various characteristics, such as local comparative advantage, factor endow-ment conditions, convergence degree between manufacturing and service industries,and the industrial structure’s status quo. As a difficult area for industrial transform-ation, northeast region should avoid large and complete industrial layouts. Accordingto its own characteristics, it should find new dominant industries, such as advancedmanufacturing, photoelectric information, and other strategic emerging industries. Onthis basis, appropriate producer services should be selected for specialization develop-ment, such as information technology services, business services, etc. To stabilize theeconomy, the eastern region should further improve the level of PSS and the qualityof PSD, so as to provide an inexhaustible power source for ER by promoting high-quality agglomeration of producer services. For example, for transportation, ware-housing and postal services, as well as leasing and business services, PSD should bechosen to strengthen the coordinated promotion of inter-regional transportation,logistics and business services. This is conducive to giving full play to spatial spillovereffect of industrial agglomeration, so as to enhance the regional resilience. The finan-cial industry should adopt a specialization agglomeration mode to serve local com-petitive industries, strategic emerging industries and high-end service industries.Meanwhile, more attention should be paid to the co-agglomeration of producerservices and manufacturing. Regions should not neglect the supporting role of theproducer service sector simply to achieve economic growth targets. While consolidatingthe development of the real economy, regions should take into account the supportiverole of producer service agglomeration in promoting manufacturing development andISU. For example, central and western regions should selectively undertake manufacturingof the eastern region, and select appropriate producer services for specialization agglomer-ation. This way can improve the ability of the producer services to accurately supportmanufacturing development, and reduce the spatial mismatch effect between the producerservices and the manufacturing through blind imitation among local governments.This study has some limitations. Firstly, producer services include high-end andlow-end sub-industries, and their specialization and diversified agglomeration mayhave different impacts on economic resilience. This is a direction of future research,which is helpful to find out the regional competitive advantages of each sub-industry,and can provide reference for regions to formulate ER improvement policies accord-ing to local conditions. Second, the convergence of producer services and manufac-turing is important for enhancing ER. However, this indicator is not included in ourpaper due to a lack of data. The convergence index of manufacturing and producerservices is best measured by the input-output tables of the national economy, whichare, however, produced only every five years.16 Y.
