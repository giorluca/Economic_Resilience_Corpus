The economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been felt by the Indonesian people since the implementation of the Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) on March 15, 2020. Community activities are forced to be carried out through digital transformation in services, transactions and work, for example the  DKI Jakarta Provincial Government The digitalization of media through the wide internet gateway is open to all people. Most of the world's population is connected to the internet. There are several research results that Indonesia ranks one to five as the country with the largest number of social media to the content that floods the digital medium. For institutions or organizations, it provides a kind of alternative for information dissemination, activation, Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities And Evaluation DKI Jakarta… Saktisyahputra, dkk 110 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023  public and business communication, as well as public relations and business activities for institutions. Digital media provides changes and even revolutions in the relationship between institutions and society. During this time, communication tends to be dominated by one-way and broadcast type, but now it has become interactivity. Institutions and audiences are entities (in internet language referred to as nodes) that are comparable, are in the same network, and can influence. For example, digital media constructs trust and sentiment through trending topics, viral, as well as issues discussed and stored (databases and archives) that can be accessed. (Nasrullah, 2021). The digital communication research trend is on the rise and is popular nowadays. This is evidenced by many researchers conducting research and publications in international journals discussing digital communication. Like (Dua, 2017), (Priyowidodo, Angela, Wijayanti, & Vidyarini, 2019), (Wahyudin, Darmawan, Suryadi, Setiawati, & Rahmawati, 2021), (Dwityas, Maulana, Hesti, Briandana, & Kurniasari, 2020), (Mansell & Steinmueller, 2020), (Rizaldi, et al., 2021), (Kim & Desai, 2021), (Tauro, Pannielo, & Pellegrino, 2021), (Soedarsono, Mohamad, Adamu, & Pradita, 2020), (Permatasari, Soelistiyowati, Suastami, & Johan, 2021) discusses how the use and utilization of digital communication in various communication industries such as Public Relations, Advertising, Marketing Communication, Social Media and Broadcasting is happening around the world today. Based on the formulation of the problem above, the purpose of this study is to find out the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government  Efforts in Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Recovery through Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities and Evaluation in Jakarta.  METHOD This study uses the method of Phenomenology of Edmund Husserl. Husserl asserted that not only research but philosophy of theory or philosophy of science. The method used to find out from his experience actually becomes the truth he experiences.Method is to be understood here not as a technique of research, but in the etymological sense of a means of access to a field of research, which is to say that those considerations belong to the theory or philosophy of science. According to Husserl, the method of achieving eidetic knowledge is knowledge of reality. So, intentionality or directness to objective knowledge is a formal goal.Intentionally, denoting the presentational and objectivating function of consciousness, more precisely, the fact that the same object appears in a variety of manners of presentation, is entirely due to apperceptive characters. Practicing the phenomenological method, the non-essential elements are reduced through epoche. By placing non-essential elements to consciousness to capture the meaning and understanding of reality. (Poespowardojo & Seran, 2016) Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process. Communication management can be defined as public relations activities and accompanying activities to run programs, campaigns, and projects (Kirk Hallahan in Heath, 2013: 153) (Nasrullah, 2021).In simple terms, planning can be grouped into four clusters of digital communication activities, namely promotion, conversion, strategy, content. Strategy The first activity is conducting market research. This is done by determining the target target, segmentation, target age, situation or demographics. The second activity carries out campaign goals (campaign goals). The third activity of the publication channel, this is done by analyzing social media, publication channels, types of content on social media. The fourth activity determines promotion channels. The fifth stage is to determine the main performance indicators (KPIs). Content Creating content by means of Keyword Analysis, something that is currently popular in the community. Keywords will be optimized on social media. Content Planning (Content Planning). Defined campaign Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities And Evaluation DKI Jakarta… Saktisyahputra, dkk 111 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023  content outline, content calendar. The next stage is content creation (Content Creation). Content writing according to the selection of the right hashtags, content according to SEO, social media algorithms. Promotion Promotion used can be in the form of Organic Media (Organic Media). Drafting email blast, IG Story, FB Story, Facebook Page, Newsletter, Content Template. Paid Promotion can also be done using Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads. Conversion Conversion activities are carried out by following up on Action (Follow Up Action). Subjects that engage audiences in events, seminars, webinars, product sales, discounts, quizzes, videos, content, and more. Media Offer (Media Offer) will prepare a landing page as a conversion link that is distributed on social media and other digital media. (Nasrullah, 2021) Evaluation in Digital Communication The institution's digital communication management will evaluate the performance that has been carried out. Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results. (Nasrullah, 2021) The objects used as informants in this research are Mr. Syubhan Akib, SH., M.I.Kom who lives in Pancoran, South Jakarta as a Digital Communication Practitioner and Mrs. Angelika Rosma, S.S., M.Si who lives in Jati, East Jakarta as a Digital Communication Practitioner. The results of the study were formulated in two main terms, namely the quality of the research instrument, and the quality of data collection. The quality of the research instrument is in accordance with the validity and reliability of the instrument and the quality of data collection is in accordance with the methods used to collect data. Data collection is done naturally (natural setting), in the laboratory with experimental methods, at home, seminar meetings, discussions, and others. The technique of collecting is done by questionnaire (questionnaire), observation (observation), interview (interview), and collaboration. (Sugiyono & Lestari, 2021) Data analysis in qualitative research is carried out during data collection. Researchers conduct interviews, if the answers interviewed after being analyzed feel unsatisfactory, the researcher will continue the question until the stage of obtaining data that is considered credible. Miles & Huberman (1992) suggested that activities in qualitative data analysis were carried out interactively. Activities in data analysis are data reduction, data display, and data verification. Conclusions in qualitative research answer the problem formulation, maybe not. The conclusions of qualitative research are expected to get new findings that have never existed or complement existing findings. The findings are in the form of a description or description of the object of research.  (Ronda, 2018).  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Researchers conducted interviews with key informant Mr. Syubhan Akib, S.H., M.I.Kom, 35 years old, lives at Street Pancoran West II no. 22 Pancoran South Jakarta as a Digital Communication Practitioner. Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process. Communication management can be defined as public relations activities and accompanying activities to run programs, campaigns, and projects (Kirk Hallahan in Heath, 2013: 153) (Nasrullah, 2021). The DKI Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities And Evaluation DKI Jakarta… Saktisyahputra, dkk 112 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023  Jakarta Provincial Government's digital communication has been going well. This is in accordance with the statement of Mr. Syubhan Akib as follows: “…Digital communication for the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government has been going well. This can be seen from how the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's social media is used as a means of communication in the digital realm, outside of the existing official website. Likewise with the JAKI Application which already contains many features. All of these things help Jakarta residents when they have problems or need answers related to various things which ultimately helps Jakarta residents increase their knowledge, solve problems, and advance themselves…” Digital communication activities can be grouped into four clusters, namely strategy, content, promotion, and conversion  (Nasrullah, 2021). The digital communication channels of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government are well managed so that the public can get the information they need in various matters. This is in accordance with the statement of Mr. Syubhan Akib as follows: “…The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's digital communication channels are well managed so that the public can get the information they need in various matters. Questions asked via digital communication channels were also responded to quite quickly. This allows residents to quickly get the information they need to solve problems, get additional information, or develop themselves and their businesses…” The institution's digital communication management will evaluate the performance that has been carried out. Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results. (Nasrullah, 2021). The evaluation of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's digital communication management seems to be going well. Mr. Syubhan Akib said that “…The evaluation of the digital communication management of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government seems to be going well. This can be seen from the content on various digital communication channels of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government which is growing and varied. Responses to questions or complaints from the public are also getting faster and faster…” The researcher also conducted interviews with the informant Mrs. Angelika Rosma, S.S., M.Si as a 45-year-old Digital Communication Practitioner who lives at Pulo Asem North Street 11 No. 41 B East Jakarta.Planned communication is an important part of the digital communication media management process. Communication management can be defined as public relations activities and accompanying activities to run programs, campaigns, and projects (Kirk Hallahan in Heath, 2013: 153) (Nasrullah, 2021). The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's digital communication planning has been massive in the context of digital media. Mrs. Angelika Rosma said that “…Actually, if I see him in the current era of the Governor of DKI Jakarta, he is indeed very massive in the context of digital media, meaning that from a public relations perspective he is very good when I see it because every time there are policies, the socialization is fast, both through short videos and videos. social media videos and on the other hand the assistance for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises is also quite good. The trainings are conducted online and the Institute of Social Sciences and Management STIAMI has also collaborated with the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government and its Jakpreneur. Lecturers of the STIAMI Institute of Social Sciences and Management are also consultants there. I remember that time I took the branding segment. So in terms of sustainable development, it is good, but the record is that socialization for sustainable upgrades must be considered because if it only reaches the training point, for example, then it is not accompanied during the practical period, then there is no evaluation, it will not be measurable enough…” Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities And Evaluation DKI Jakarta… Saktisyahputra, dkk 113 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023  Digital communication activities can be grouped into four clusters, namely strategy, content, promotion, and conversion (Nasrullah, 2021). The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's Digital Communication Strategy is quite diverse and quite massive. Mrs. Angelika Rosma says “…I see that the strategy carried out by the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government for market research is quite diverse, meaning that the segments are different. The Eradication of Corruption (KPK) is an international event in the field of sports, then for market research it is quite diverse and quite segmented. Then if the target is social media and public channels, I see that his Instagram is quite massive and Mr. Anies' Instagram is also quite massive. Then the videos made by Public Relations of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government are also quite massive and there are some who are not only Mr. Anies, but also Deputy The governor of DKI Jakarta also often appears. So the first person and the second person in DKI Jakarta, in my opinion, the socialization downwards is quite strong, both in order to provide socialization of the regulations and policies of the DKI Jakarta Governor Regulation or the announcement which is usually more towards a celebration, which is also strong. The keyword is still the same when Mr. Anies served as Governor of DKI Jakarta Province, namely Forward the City is Happy. The citizens are actually broken down with the policies of the current Governor of DKI Jakarta, which are quite friendly, such as the Rp.0 DP house policy, although reportedly it seems quite difficult too. but in fact the policy is very helpful, the popular policies seem to be paying off the marbots of the mosque and in terms of the content, the context of the hashtag, namely Maju the City is Happy, the Citizens and also what Mr. Anies often uses is collaboration, right. So the collaboration that Mr. Anies conveyed is enough to describe how he is open to all groups…” The institution's digital communication management will evaluate the performance that has been carried out. Evaluation is also interpreted as monitoring and feedback. The managers of digital communication media in the human resources department do special things to handle digital communications. Create a digital communication plan and carry out the execution of the plan, to the desired output, impact, and results (Nasrullah, 2021). The evaluation of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government's digital communication is in the good category, but I have some notes that need to be improved. Mrs. Angelika Rosma says “…I feel right now it's already in the good category. However, if we can see the reports of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government through their social media at the end of the management, it is even better because this will be an endorser for the next interim official in order to maintain the good things that have been achieved by the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government at this time. there are several notes, such as the construction of a house of Rp. 0 which has not been in accordance with the promises made at the beginning of office. But on the other hand, when we face the third year of the pandemic, this will certainly affect big projects, in this case the people's purchasing power, even though Rp. 0 houses are reportedly running out all the time and need to be reproduced in the future, how about good and affordable housing for the community. is still a community need. Currently, DKI Jakarta Province is still getting more beautiful, meaning that the strengths of Jakarta's branding are getting better, the better the hope is that it can be maintained. The problem of flooding is still a record in my opinion and this needs to be understood that this is certainly not only a problem for the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government, of course, the Central Government should come directly to help not only the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government but also we know that in DKI Jakarta there is a Central Government that actually also certainly have the authority and responsibility to help problems such as floods and so on…”       Digital Communication Management Planning, Activities And Evaluation DKI Jakarta… Saktisyahputra, dkk 114 | International Conference STIAMI        Prosiding Seminar Stiami ISSN 2355-2883 March 11, 2023  CONCLUSION Based on the Data Findings, Data Results and Discussions that the researchers have conveyed, it can be concluded that the  DKI Jakarta Provincial Government  has implemented Digital Communication Management both from Planning, Activities and Evaluation in helping an inclusive and sustainable economic recovery.

This can be seen from the content on various digital communication channels of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government which is growing and varied. Responses to questions or complaints from the public are also getting faster. Recommendations for the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government to increase the construction of Rp.0 DP housing because this program is very much needed by the citizens of Jakarta. The two officials in charge of temporary replacement for the current Governor and Deputy Governor of DKI Jakarta should be able to maintain and improve digital communication work programs that have been achieved previously. The three DKI Jakarta Provincial Governments can carry out a dialogue and harmonious synergy with the Central Government to help deal with problems that exist in DKI Jakarta Province such as Flood, Garbage, Crime and so on through good digital communication so that economic recovery is inclusive and sustainable. can be achieved.
